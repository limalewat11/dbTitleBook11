<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Miracle of Mindfulness: A Manual on Meditation</h2><p>In this beautiful and lucid guide, Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh offers gentle anecdotes and practical exercise as a means of learning the skills of mindfulness--being awake and fully aware. From washing the dishes to answering the phone to peeling an orange, he reminds us that each moment holds within it an opportunity to work toward greater self-understanding and peacefulness.</p><p><i>Miracle of Mindfulness</i> is a sly commentary on the <i>Anapanasati Sutra</i>, the Sutra on Breath to Maintain Mindfulness. "Sly" because it doesn't read like a dry commentary at all. One of Thich Nhat Hanh's most popular books, <i>Miracle of Mindfulness</i> is about how to take hold of your consciousness and keep it alive to the present reality, whether eating a tangerine, playing with your children, or washing the dishes. A world-renowned Zen master, Nhat Hanh weaves practical instruction with anecdotes and other stories to show how the meditative mind can be achieved at all times and how it can help us all "reveal and heal." Nhat Hanh is a master at helping us find a calm refuge within ourselves and teaching us how to reach out from there to the rest of the world. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Thich Nhat Hanh is author of <i>Living Buddha, Living Christ</i> and <i>The Blooming of a Lotus</i>.</p><h2>Eight Keys to Biblical Revival: The Saga of Scriptural Spiritual Awakenings, How They Shaped the Great Revivals of the Past, and Their Powerful Impl</h2><p>Examines the many Biblical examples of revival and outlines eight key factors that define the essence of a true spiritual awakening</p><p></p><h2>Band Saw Handbook</h2><p>Here&#x2019;s every saw, blade, option, and technique&#x2014;along with 1,000 illustrations and instructions that present a complete course in cutting basics. &#x201c;Offers some terrific troubleshooting hints, projects, and basic instructions.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i>. &#x201c;Even devoted band saw users will find valuable information in this book...an enlightening experience.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Workbench</i>. &#x201c;Duginske describes how to properly fine-tune and use this versatile tool for straight cuts, curves, and joinery.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br></p><p></p><h2>Roget&#39;s International Thesaurus, 7th Edition</h2><p><p><strong>The most up-to-date edition of the world&#x2019;s bestselling thesaurus, <em>Roget&#x2019;s International Thesaurus, 7th Edition,</em> gives writers of all levels an unparalleled aid in using language with precision, grace, and power.</strong> </p><p>The most comprehensive, user-friendly thesaurus available, <em>Roget&#x2019;s</em> features more than 325,000 words and phrases, including more than 2,000 all-new entries that reflect the very latest in culture and technology, from &#x201c;alpha male&#x201d; to&#x201c;zero tolerance.&#x201d; The seventh edition has reduced archaic terminology and added 50 new word lists, providing greater ease-of-use and accessibility than any other writer&#x2019;s reference book on the market.

A few weeks later, it completely collapsed. The disaster was largely triggered by one man: thirty-two-year-old hotshot trader Brian Hunter. His high-risk bets on natural gas prices bankrupted his firm and destroyed his career, while John Arnold, his rival at competitor fund Centaurus, emerged as the highest-paid trader on Wall Street. Meticulously researched and character-driven, <i>Hedge Hogs</i> is a riveting fly-on-the-wall account of the largest hedge fund collapse in history: a blistering tale of the recent past that explains our precarious present . . . and may predict our future.<br> &nbsp;<br> Using emails, instant messages, court testimony, and exclusive interviews, securities analyst turned investigative reporter Barbara T. Dreyfuss charts the colliding paths of these two charismatic traders who dominated the speculative energy market. We follow Brian Hunter, the Canadian farm boy and elbows-out high school basketball star, as he achieves phenomenal early success, only to see his ambition, greed, and hubris precipitate his downfall. Set in relief is the journey of John Arnold, whose mild manner, sophisticated tastes, and low profile belied his own ferocious competitive streak. As the two clash, hundreds of millions of dollars in pension and endowment money is imperiled, with devastating public consequences.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Hedge Hogs</i> takes you behind closed doors into the shadowy world of hedge funds, the unregulated wild side of finance, where over-the-top parties and lavish perks abound and billions of dollars of other people&#x2019;s money are in the hands of a tiny elite. Dreyfuss traces the rise of this freewheeling industry while detailing the decades of bank, hedge fund, and commodity deregulation that turned Wall Street into a speculative casino.<br> &nbsp;<br> A gripping saga peppered with fast money, vivid characters, and high drama, <i>Hedge Hogs</i> is also an important and timely cautionary tale&#x2014;a vivisection of a financial system jeopardized by reckless practices, watered-down regulation, and loopholes in government oversight, just waiting for the next bust.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Hedge Hogs</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Regulators, legislators and judges inclined to sympathize with the industry ought to rush out and buy a copy of Barbara Dreyfuss&#x2019;s <i>Hedge Hogs,</i> a wonderfully instructive tale about Amaranth Advisors. . . . Dreyfuss, a Wall Street analyst turned investigative journalist, not only plowed through what turned out to be a treasure trove of official records and transcripts, but supplemented it with plenty of her own reporting. She manages to organize it all into a tight, riveting and understandable yarn.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Clearly and entertainingly told . . . a salutary example of how traders who believe they are super-smart might be nothing more than lucky, and how there is nothing so intoxicating as the ability to speculate with other people&#x2019;s money.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Economist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Dreyfuss] does a great job of putting Amaranth&#x2019;s out-of-control trader into historical context, explaining the blitz of deregulation that set the stage for someone like Hunter to do maximum damage.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Bloomberg</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The definitive take on the largest hedge fund collapse in history . . .

Over and over again he&#x2019;d juggled the complicated mathematical formulas in his head, called on his trading associates, and consulted the charts, graphs, and weather forecasts that filled the screens in front of him, calculating the odds. An unexpected cold winter that would cause a spike in gas prices? It had seemed likely. Stronger than expected demand, at least stronger than other traders were counting on? He thought it possible. A hurricane-�induced supply disruption? There was a good chance.<br><br>So he&#x2019;d bet big. Throughout the year, he&#x2019;d singlehandedly dominated the trading of natural gas. At times he&#x2019;d held 50 percent or more of all the contracts for the huge natural gas market in the months ahead, betting that winter prices would rise.<br><br>But speculating on natural gas prices was risky business, and by August Brian Hunter knew he was in trouble. And billions of dollars of other people&#x2019;s money were on the line.<br><br>Although it was still hot and sticky in Connecticut, where his firm was headquartered, Hunter was feverishly thinking ahead to the first chill of winter, when he had expected demand for gas to pick up, sparking price hikes and letting him make a killing.<br><br>He&#x2019;d already spent large sums propping up his positions while waiting for something, anything&#x2014;�a hurricane, a pipeline disruption, a delivery bottleneck&#x2014;�that would push winter prices up. But there had been nothing. Indeed, if anything caused prices of gas contracts to go his way at times, it was likely Hunter&#x2019;s own trading. So powerful was he that he&#x2019;d created his own wave, all by himself. Now what?<br><br>Lots of other people smelled the scent of gas in the air and feared an explosion. The executives at his hedge fund, Amaranth, were getting worried, since too much of the company&#x2019;s assets were tangled up in Hunter&#x2019;s precarious portfolio. They were pressing him to unload a big chunk of his holdings. Usually Hunter and the handful of traders he oversaw operated out of an office in Calgary, Alberta. But for several months, wary Amaranth executives repeatedly ordered Hunter and his team of traders to fly east to Greenwich, Connecticut, so that they could more easily scrutinize their trading.<br><br>Brokers at J. P. Morgan, which handled Hunter&#x2019;s trades and collected the collateral he needed for them, were alarmed at the size of his holdings too. Already in mid-�August they&#x2019;d demanded that his firm post as much as $2 billion to guarantee his bets.<br><br>And down at the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) they could smell gas too. The officials at the world&#x2019;s largest energy commodity exchange, not unused to watching high-�stakes gambles unfold, warned Hunter to cut back.<br><br>Although he didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, Hunter had yet another problem. About fifteen hundred miles away to the southwest, his main rival, John Arnold, didn&#x2019;t see things the way Hunter did. And he was ready to pounce.<br><br>Arnold was widely considered the top energy trader in the world. A wily Enron veteran, Arnold was exactly the same age as Hunter, but perhaps a bit more experienced in the high-�stakes energy trading game. He too ran and reran the numbers and analyzed the fundamentals of the natural gas market, and he didn&#x2019;t believe that gas prices were likely to rise significantly with the approach of winter&#x2019;s icy blast. The previous winter had been mild, Arnold knew. Natural gas supplies during the spring and summer were relatively plentiful. And the quantities of gas in storage were higher than at any time in the past half decade. So as Hunter placed bets on rising prices, Arnold was putting money behind his confident belief that winter prices would decline.<br><br>Not that either Hunter or Arnold came anywhere near an actual gas container. Nor did they come close to the network of buried pipelines, collecting stations, and pumping facilities that pushed gas from Texas, Louisiana, and the Gulf north to the energy-�hungry Midwest and Northeast. They were speculators, buying and selling paper, placing bets with brokers and on computerized exchanges, hoping to earn a profit from shifts in the price of gas. The contracts and other investments they traded represented&#x2014;�somewhere in the future&#x2014;�millions of cubic feet of natural gas. But they made money not when actual gas changed hands but when contracts for that gas changed hands. And make&#x2014;�and lose&#x2014;�money they did.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time that Hunter and Arnold clashed. They&#x2019;d disagreed before on where gas prices were headed. Several times in the past twelve months, particularly on the final, crucial day of trading expiring monthly gas contracts, Hunter and Arnold faced off, with one or the other coming out ahead.<br><br>Most people think that the price of a resource such as natural gas is determined by old-�fashioned supply and demand, and to some degree it is. But more and more in the kind of speculative trading that Hunter and Arnold engaged in, other factors&#x2014;�market psychology and the stratagems of traders who dominated any given day&#x2019;s trading&#x2014;�had a powerful impact on prices, at least over the short term. And Hunter and Arnold dominated trading that year.<br><br>In late August, there was also intense pressure on Hunter to figure out how to handle his pile of summer contracts. Just as Hunter expected winter prices to rise sharply, he also counted on summer prices to fall. Many of his investments were arranged so that he would make money if either happened. He not only bet on the price in various months but on the difference in price between summer and winter months.<br><br>But that summer prices did not go down. In fact, a heat wave that hit in the last week of July, increasing demand for electricity for air-�conditioning, along with the threat of supply disruptions from a passing tropical storm, combined to cause prices to jump 17 percent.<br><br>Even tiny changes in gas prices can have enormous impact on a trader&#x2019;s profits or losses. Because of the way gas contracts are priced, if a trader holds ten thousand contracts, then just a measly 1-�cent price shift translates into a change of $1 million in the value of his holdings. And Hunter controlled much more than that. In fact, he was invested in hundreds of thousands of contracts.<br><br>All summer long Hunter had waited for prices to fall, and as each month drew to a close, he rolled his holdings forward into the next month. By the end of August he was running out of months, as his portfolio was short 56,000 September contracts. It was an enormous position.<br><br>But Hunter took a gamble. Rather than get out of his contracts at fire-�sale prices, he decided to double down on his bet. He added to his position and by August 28 had shorted 96,000 September contracts. The amount of gas they represented was about one-�quarter of all the gas used by residential consumers that entire year.<br><br>The next day, August 29, was the last trading day for September contracts. With his bosses, his bank, and NYMEX breathing down his neck, Hunter desperately planned two strategies to bail himself out.<br><br>First, he would do some more trading in September contracts, shorting even more. Perhaps he hoped that would depress prices further. He planned to let September holdings expire at the end of the day. Maybe he would do all right.<br><br>Second, he decided to place another bet&#x2014;�that the difference between the September and October contract prices would widen. Usually these months traded within 7 or 8 cents of each other. But thanks in part to Hunter&#x2019;s huge trading, which had helped depress September prices, the difference between the two months was now about 34 cents. He hoped the difference would widen even more the next day and he would make some money.<br><br>John Arnold, who was watching supply and demand fundamentals, sensed something else. He looked at the wide price difference that suddenly occurred between September and October gas prices on August 28 and became suspicious. There didn&#x2019;t seem to be any fundamentals to justify it.<br><br>Not only that, but Arnold expected September prices to rise.<br><br>So as the final seconds ticked down before the 10:00 a.m. Eastern time start of trading on August 29, the battle lines were drawn. Hunter, from his desk in Greenwich, with vast sums at stake, wanted September prices to go down. Arnold, at his perch in Houston, was counting on them going up.<br><br>As trading kicked off, Hunter sat amidst other commodity traders who were busy buying and selling electricity, grain, metals, and oil. Behind him, looking over his shoulder, sat one of his firm&#x2019;s senior managers, Rob Jones, who normally stayed in his office. He was carefully watching Hunter&#x2019;s trades.<br><br>In Houston, Texas, on the eighth floor of a glass-�walled office building in the fashionable Galleria mall area, John Arnold too began trading.<br><br>At first they seemed to be testing the marketplace, trading in small amounts. Within the first ten minutes Hunter shorted just over five hundred September contracts. John Arnold bought slightly less than half that amount. Between 10:10 a.m. and 10:20 a.m. Hunter sold close to four hundred contracts; Arnold bought an almost equal number. Over the next forty minutes they made smaller trades, but Hunter always shorted, Arnold always bought.1<br><br>As the morning wore on, the size of their trades increased. Right before noon Hunter sold just over 2,500 contracts. Arnold only bought about half that number. Especially during the first couple of hours of trading, Hunter seemed to get the edge. September prices tipped down in Hunter&#x2019;s favor by 10 or 20 cents. The difference between the September and October contracts widened to as much as 50 cents. For Hunter this was good news.<br><br>By early afternoon, with less than an hour to go before the end of trading, Hunter had shorted just over 15,000 September contracts. Arnold&#x2019;s buying had not quite kept up with Hunter&#x2019;s trading.<br><br>Although commodity investing was supposed to be anonymous, the brokers who placed many of the trades tended to talk, especially when Brian Hunter and John Arnold were facing off. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Brian and John show,&#x201d; some quipped to other traders, asking which side they were on. &#x201c;Can you believe how much money these guys are throwing around?&#x201d; they marveled.<br><br>But then, at about 1:45 p.m., with forty-�five minutes left to the trading day, events took an ominous turn for Hunter: September contract prices began to tick up, and the price difference between September and October narrowed.<br><br>Brian Hunter had already stopped trading. He was under orders from government regulators not to trade heavily in the final half hour of exchange activity.<br><br>So he was done for the day. But not John Arnold. He was suddenly buying thousands of September contracts. As the clock ticked inexorably toward the end of the trading day, the price of September natural gas contracts moved in only one direction.<br><br>In the balance hung Hunter&#x2019;s investments&#x2014;�along with Amaranth&#x2019;s very solvency and the fortunes of its myriad investors.</p><h2>Infiltration</h2><p>Examines Nazi Germany&#39;s industrial and armament struggles, revealing the rivalry between Speer and Himmler, and discusses Speer&#39;s attempts to save Jewish workers and his coming to terms with his own moral responsibility</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Lepanto</h2><p><p><strong>Edited by Dale Ahlquist</strong></p> <p>Hilaire Belloc called "Lepanto" Chesterton's greatest poem and the greatest poem of his generation.

How then did it come to be that there was a Second World War causing twiceas much loss of life and more destruction than any other previous conflict? <br><br>In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Gerhard L. Weinberg provides an introduction to the origins, course, and impact of the war on those who fought and the ordinary citizens who lived through it.

Exploring the costs and effects of the war, Weinberg concludes by considering the long-lasting mark World War II has left on society today.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

On an October night in 1995, Roy, a talented young hockey player, skated onto the ice for his varsity debut with Boston University. Eleven fateful seconds later, he was paralyzed from the neck down. Aided by the sure touch of <i>Sports Illustrated</i> hockey writer E.M. Swift, Roy's moving account of his accident and his rehabilitation--confined to a wheelchair, he's gotten some use of his right arm back--avoids the maudlin. Instead, <i>Eleven Seconds</i> is filled with grit, hope, humor, and a thoughtful young man's introspection on the meaning of sports and the adjustments that follow when the ability to play them is taken away.Eleven seconds was all it took. Eleven seconds to stop cold a shining career scarcely before it had taken off on the ice. Travis Roy was a promising twenty-year-old hockey star. Then moments into his first collegiate game as a Boston University freshman, a freak accident drove Travis into the boards. A cracked fourth vertebra left him paralyzed from the neck down. That fateful October night in 1995 signaled the death of one dream - but also the eventual rebirth of a special kind of hope. For, though imprisoned for months in a hospital bed, then confined to a wheelchair, Travis gradually found the grit and the will to reclaim for himself a fulfilling and productive life. Eleven seconds is a story about America&#39;s love affair with sports and the people who embrace its never-die spirit. Most of all, it is the story of one young man who surrendered to no limits and defied all odds, both before and after the tragedy that ended his game.</p><h2>Summer (Seasons board books)</h2><p><p>Full of fun, active illustrations, this chunky board book shows the joys of fishing for tadpoles, playing at the beach, eating ice-cream, and enjoying evening picnics.</p></p><p><p>Enjoy the best of summer in this beautiful board book: fishing for tadpoles, playing at the beach, eating ice-cream, and enjoying evening picnics.</p>Gerda Muller was born in 1926 in Naarden, Holland.

How often, though, do we consider the challenging questions God asks? Hudson notes that Jesus was asked 183 questions in the Gospels but directly only answered three. The Creator is teaching us as we teach children when they struggle with schoolwork: You learn more by doing than being fed an absolute answer. In <i>Questions God Asks Us</i>, we're encouraged to focus on the quest than a resolution. Such an approach leads to deeper dialogue and intimacy with the divine. This is a critical turning point in our journey with God - as it was for the author. "I thought the Bible existed to give me solutions to my everyday concerns and dilemmas," writes Hudson. "Then I realized I might be approaching God and the Bible from the wrong direction. It was as if God said to me, 'Trevor, rather than you always asking questions of me, start listening to the questions I have for you." Each of 10 questions Hudson excerpts from the Old and New Testaments serve as a starting point for genuine conversation with the Creator. He assures, "We're not starting the conversation with God from scratch. God has already begun it. We just need to plug into the conversation that is already going on." <i>Questions God Asks Us</i> offers a fresh approach for personal devotions and a unique discussion tool for small group Bible studies. It's sure to bless anyone longing for a meaningful, growing relationship with God.</p><p>Trevor Hudson is married to Debbie, and together they are the parents of Joni and Mark.

Turning your sprinklers on will discourage them from hanging around the front of your house; loud music and smoke from barbecues will also keep them away. They are not a problem, just another part of the suburban landscape, their brittle legs moving as slowly as clouds. They have always been here, since before anyone remembers, since before the bush was cleared and all the houses were built.<br><br>Adults pay them little attention. Young children sometimes dress them in old clothes and hats as if they were dolls or scarecrows, and are always scolded by parents, whose reasons are unclear. &#x2018;Just don&#x2019;t,&#x2019; they say sternly.<br><br>Some older boys take great delight in beating them with baseball bats, golf clubs, or whatever is at hand, including the victim&#x2019;s own snapped-off limbs. With careful aim a good strike will send the head &#x2014; a faceless clod of earth &#x2014; flying high into the air. The body remains passively upright until smashed to splinters between heels and asphalt.<br><br>This can go on for hours, depending on how many the boys can find. But eventually it stops being amusing. It becomes boring, somehow enraging, the way they just stand there and take it. What are they? Why are they here? What do they want? Whack! Whack! Whack! <br><br>The only response is the sound of dead branches falling from old trees on windless evenings, and random holes appearing in front lawns, dark sockets where clods of earth have been removed during the night. And sure enough there they are again, standing by fences and driveways, in alleyways and parks, silent sentinels.<br><br>Are they here for a reason? It&#x2019;s impossible to know, but if you stop and stare at them for a long time, you can imagine that they too might be searching for answers, for some kind of meaning. It&#x2019;s as if they take all our questions and offer them straight back: Who are you? Why are you here? What do you want?<br><b>The Nameless holiday</b><br><br>The nameless holiday happens once a year, usually around late August, sometimes October. It is always anticipated by children and adults alike with mixed emotion: it&#x2019;s not exactly festive, but still a celebration of sorts, the origin of which has been long forgotten.<br><br>All that is known are the familiar rituals: the laying out of one&#x2019;s most prized possessions on the bedroom floor; then choosing one special object &#x2014; exactly the right one &#x2014; and carrying it carefully up a ladder to the roof and leaving it under the TV aerial (already decorated with small shiny things such as chocolate wrappers, old CDs, and the tops off tubs of yoghurt, licked clean and threaded with string, tied with special slip-knots).<br><br>Then there is the traditional midnight picnic in the backyard, front lawn, or any place with a good view of one&#x2019;s own roof &#x2014; across the street if necessary, which is why families sometimes gather by the roadside on blankets. Here are born fond memories of freshly baked gingerbread crows, hot pomegranate juice as tart as a knife and small plastic whistles, inaudible to the ears of both humans and dogs. Not to mention all that excited chatter and giggling, all that polite shushing, everyone struggling to observe the convention of silence.<br><br>Those who stay awake long enough are rewarded by a momentary sound that never fails to draw a sharp intake of breath &#x2014; the delicate tapping of hoofs descending on roof tiles. It is always so startling, so hard to believe at first, like a waking dream or a rumour made solid. But sure enough, there he is, the reindeer with no name: enormous, blind as a bat, sniffing under the TV aerial with infinite animal patience. He always knows exactly which objects are so loved that their loss will be felt like the snapping of a cord to the heart, and it&#x2019;s only these that he nudges tenderly until they become hooked onto his great antlers. The rest he leaves alone, leaping gracefully back up into the cool darkness.<br><br>What a remarkable, unnameable feeling it is, right at the moment of his leaping: something like sadness and regret, of suddenly wanting your gift back and held tight to your chest, knowing that you will certainly never see it again. And then there is the letting go as your muscles release, your lungs exhale, and the backwash of longing leaves behind this one image on the shore of memory: a huge reindeer on your roof, bowing down.</p><h2>The (Mis)Behaviour of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin and Reward</h2><p>Fractal geometry is the mathematics of roughness: how to reduce the outline of a jagged leaf, a rocky coastline or a static in a computer connection to a few simple mathematical properties - to make the complex simple. With his fractal tools, Benoit Mandelbrot has got to the bottom of how financial markets really work. He finds they have a shifting sense of time, a unique dimension and a wild kind of behaviour that makes them volatile, dangerous - and also beautiful. In Mandelbrot&#39;s fractal models, the complex gyrations of IBM&#39;s stock price, the FTSE 100 cotton trading and exchange rates can be reduced to straightforward formulae that yield a much more accurate description of the risks involved.</p><p>Benoit Mandelbrot is Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Yale University.

No, actually I didn&#x2019;t want to die. Or live. I just didn&#x2019;t care. Dying would have been better than puking my guts out again in a bucket. Which wouldn&#x2019;t have been so bad if the bucket hadn&#x2019;t been inside a freezing Flying Fortress halfway between Iceland and England, trying to ride out a North Atlantic storm. And if there hadn&#x2019;t been a war going on, and I hadn&#x2019;t been headed right for it.<br><br>I wanted to reach for the bucket again but the floor dropped out from under me as the Fortress was pounded by powerful, howling storm winds that seemed to scream at the fuselage, clawing at the plane&#x2019;s skin for a way inside. Canvascovered crates bounced on each other, held down by knotted ropes and the weight of what they carried. I worried about being crushed to death before I ever got to England, a crate of beans or grenades or whatever was important enough to rate air transport ending my military career. The waist gunner openings were closed up. Only a small Perspex window let in what little light there was among the gray clouds at twenty thousand feet. The noise from the storm and the four straining engines pounded in my head like a jackhammer<br>orchestra. I prayed for the plane to steady itself and held on to the hard metal seat for dear life. All I could think about was the fact that, just two days before, I was fat, dumb, and happy, just about to graduate from Officer Candidate School, and ready to enjoy the delights of life as a staff officer at the War Department in Washington, D.C. I was all set. The fix was in. Now I was in a fix.<br><br>I never wanted to be in the army. I was happy as a cop on the beat in Boston, just like my dad and my uncles, and seldom even left South Boston, where the Boyle family lived and worked. I had been on the job for three years, and my dad and his brothers&nbsp;and their pals watched out for me. That&#x2019;s how it works. The rich folks on Beacon Hill look out for their own and the Irish in Southie look out for theirs. I guess it&#x2019;s like that all over the world, but I really don&#x2019;t know. Or care. That&#x2019;s the world&#x2019;s problem.<br><br>My problem was that I had just made detective three days before Pearl Harbor. It was unusual for a kid in his early twenties to make the grade. The test they gave was pretty hard. While I can usually figure things out sooner or later, I&#x2019;m no scholar. I would&#x2019;ve had a hard time, but a few of the sheets from the test sort of found their way into my locker a couple of days before the exam. I managed to pass. My uncle Dan is on the promotions board, so with a little backscratching with his buddies over a few pints of Guinness, I was in. That&#x2019;s just the way it works. I&#x2019;m not saying I&#x2019;m proud of it, but it doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m not a good cop either. It&#x2019;s not a bad system, actually. The other guys know me and know they can depend on me. I&#x2019;m not some stranger who got the job just because he&#x2019;s smart enough to answer a bunch of questions on his own. That doesn&#x2019;t mean squat when you need your partner to back you up. Three years walking the beat in Chinatown and around the harbor had taught me a lot, not to mention everything Dad tried to drum into my head. He&#x2019;s a homicide detective, and he always made sure I got assigned to a crime scene when they needed some extra bluecoats for crowd control or knocking on doors. I worked a lot of overtime, saw a lot of dead bodies, and listened to Dad talk me through his routine. Sometimes it was obvious who the killer was, like after a knife fight between drunks. Other times, it wasn&#x2019;t. Watching Dad figure things out was like watching an artist paint a picture. He used to say an investigation was a lot like art, just a blank canvas and a whole lot of different colors in little jars. All the clues were there, just like a painting was already in those little jars of paint. But you had to mix them together and put them on the canvas right, so it all made sense. Well, the only thing I can paint is a house, and sometimes I couldn&#x2019;t see how Dad figured things out, even when he explained it all to me. But he would always go through it with me afterward, hoping some of it would stick.<br><br>Anyway, I was pretty disappointed to hear about Pearl Harbor. It was tough for those guys out there, but it also meant the draft board was going to come after me. The<br>Boston PD had more cops than deferments, and we younger guys knew what was coming. I didn&#x2019;t like it much, but it looked like Uncle Sam was going to ship me off to fight the Japs. Everybody was all worked up over the Japs, but it seemed to me that I had enough problems with the Chinese gangs down in Chinatown without taking on the rest of the Orient.<br><br>I thought maybe the military police would be a good choice, to stay in the game sort of. Dad nixed that idea right away. He&#x2019;d hated the MPs he&#x2019;d run into in France during the First World War and said no son of his would ever earn his keep busting poor enlisted men over a drink or the ladies. OK, that was that.<br><br>Uncle Dan didn&#x2019;t want me to go at all. He and Dad went off to war in 1917 with their older brother, Frank. Frank got killed his first day at the front. It broke Grandma&#x2019;s<br>heart and I think Dad and Uncle Dan&#x2019;s, too. I never really knew how hard it had hit them until one night over drinks at Kirby&#x2019;s Bar, right after New Year&#x2019;s, just a month after Pearl Harbor. I could tell they were working up to tell me something. It took a couple of Bushmills Irish whiskeys before they got around to it.<br><br>&#x201c;If somebody comes after the Boyles, then it&#x2019;s personal, and we all back each other up,&#x201d; my dad started. &#x201c;You know that, Billy. But this war, it&#x2019;s no good for us. The Boyles have finally made it here. No one ever helped us, especially when Da couldn&#x2019;t get work because &#x2018;No Irish Need Apply.&#x2019; We&#x2019;ve worked hard to build something for you here, and we&#x2019;re not going to let this war with the Japs and Germans take it away from you. It&#x2019;s not our war. No one attacked Boston or Ireland. So we&#x2019;re going to find a way to keep you safe. We don&#x2019;t want you to get killed, like Frank.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Especially not fighting for the fucking English, Billy,you remember that,&#x201d; Uncle Dan chimed in. Like any good IRA man, he hated the English. It had galled him to fight on<br>the same side as the English in his war, and he didn&#x2019;t want me to do the same in mine. Unfortunately, their plan didn&#x2019;t go any farther than deciding I shouldn&#x2019;t get killed, which sounded fine to me. We drank some more, and went home. Dad got yelled at. I went to sleep.<br><br>In the morning we went to Mass. That always calmed Mom down, and she was nice to Dad as we walked home from church. That&#x2019;s when she got the idea. Her second cousin, one of the Doud clan that had moved to Colorado, was married to a general who worked at the War Plans Division of the War Department in Washington, D.C. Maybe he&#x2019;d give me some sort of job there. I&#x2019;d seen him last at a family wedding a few years ago. Since he was an older guy I called him &#x201c;Uncle.&#x201d; Uncle Ike.<br><br>The Boyle family put the wheels into motion. Dad called our congressman, Teddy McCarrick, who owed him for certain favors granted during the election. Teddy was glad to oblige, knowing there was always another election around the corner. Not only did I get an immediate qualification for Officer Candidate School, but he called a week later and told Dad that my uncle had asked Army Personnel to assign me to his staff as soon as I graduated OCS. Well, all right! On my uncle&#x2019;s staff in the nation&#x2019;s capital, where the women outnumbered the men ten to one and I&#x2019;d be an officer and a gentleman. Not bad for an Irish kid from Boston. A lot better than a grave in France, according to Uncle Dan.<br><br>We only forgot one thing. The part of OCS that stood for &#x201c;School.&#x201d; I did fine in basic training. I&#x2019;d always played sports and kept in shape. I knew firearms, which is more than I can say about the other guys in boot camp. I figured it was more dangerous around the firing range there than anyplace I&#x2019;d ever see in this war. But then we went to school. Never liked it, never will. It wasn&#x2019;t the kind of school where you could bullshit your way out of trouble, like I&#x2019;d done many times back home. They really expected you to learn this stuff: map reading, tactics, command, logistics. It gave me a headache. I kept hoping that I&#x2019;d find the exam answers slipped under my door, but this wasn&#x2019;t Boston, and the noncoms were all Southern boys. Not an Irish guy among them.<br><br>Somehow, I made it. Rock bottom out of my company, but I made it. Before we got our bars my drill instructor told me I was the dumbest Irish Mick he had ever seen, and that was saying something. I thanked him for the compliment and thought, Imagine how surprised he&#x2019;ll be tomorrow when we get our orders, and I go off to the War Plans Division. Ha! I&#x2019;ll show him!<br><br>We got our orders all right, and Sarge really was surprised. So was I. I wasn&#x2019;t going to D.C. I was going to London goddamn England, to the headquarters of the U.S. Army<br>European Theater of Operations, General Dwight David Eisenhower commanding. Uncle Ike. In charge of the whole shooting match. Why, I had not a clue. I love my mom, but I had to think that maybe this was not one of her best ideas. The plane stopped rocking and lurching. The storm had calmed down, and so did my stomach. The sun rose, or we caught up with it, and things started improving. We descended through white clouds, and when I went up to the cockpit I actually enjoyed the view. I was the only passenger, not because I was special, but because a Flying Fortress bomber was not meant to be a passenger plane. I had AAA travel priority, so I had been put on the first flight out of the States headed for England. This was it, or at least for a lowly lieutenant, this was it. I had never flown before&#x2014;hell, I had never been out of Massachusetts before the Army&#x2014;and the sight of England from the air was beautiful. So green and lush, small fields marked off by stone walls and clumps of houses at intersections, huddled together like storybook villages. I closed my eyes, mentally apologized to Uncle Dan, and then opened them to admire the greenness unfolding below me as we descended lower and lower.<br><br>We landed at a military airfield. I climbed down the metal steps to the runway, stiff from sitting so long on a hard seat. One of the crew threw down my duffel bag and waved so long. I caught it and waved back, wondering what the hell was going to happen now. I walked past the wing of the Fortress and stood on the wet tarmac. Rows of aircraft lined the field. At the end of the runway, off to the side, a twisted black hulk scarred the orderly landscape, its tail fin pointing up to the sky like a cross. A real confidence builder. A jeep pulled out from a nearby hangar and stopped next to me. It was misting slightly, and the officer driving it had his trenchcoat collar turned up and his service-cap visor pulled down. My own trench coat was rumpled from the long trip, and my tie was undone. Scarf. I had to remember they called ties &#x201c;scarves&#x201d; in the army, just to confuse honest civilians. I saw the officer, a major, look down at my shoes with a grimace of distaste. I looked down, too. They were flecked with dried vomit.<br><br>&#x201c;You must be Lieutenant William Boyle. Get in.&#x201d;<br><br>In my wisest decision since I arrived in England, I kept my mouth shut, and got in.</p><h2>Automotive Bodywork &amp; Rust Repair</h2><p>There comes a time when just about every car on the road will need some form of rust or body repair. Quite often, if the car is a daily driver for running errands, repairs are never made, and the car eventually ends up in junkyard heaven. For our beloved collector cars, hot rods, and muscle cars, dents, dings, and rust are not an option, and neither is the scrap heap.

That&#x2019;s why she thinks her float in the semi-annual Santa Claus parade is a shoe-in for best in show. But when the tractor pulling Merry&#x2019;s float is sabotaged, she has to face facts: there&#x2019;s a Scrooge in Christmas Town.<br><br> Merry isn&#x2019;t ready to point fingers, especially with a journalist in town writing a puff piece about Rudolph&#x2019;s Christmas spirit. But when she stumbles upon the reporter&#x2019;s body on a late night dog walk&#x2014;and police suspect he was poisoned by a gingerbread cookie crafted by her best friend, Vicky&#x2014;Merry will have to put down the jingle bells and figure out who&#x2019;s really been grinching about town, before Vicky ends up on Santa&#x2019;s naughty list...</p><p><b>Vicki Delany</b> is the national bestselling author of the Year-Round Christmas Mysteries, the Constable Molly Smith Novels, the Sherlock Holmes Bookshop Mysteries, and, writing as Eva Gates, the Lighthouse Library Mysteries.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>The tips of the tall turquoise and green hats bobbed in the lightly falling snow as the elves weaved through crowds of painted dolls, toy soldiers, shepherds with their sheep, reindeer, poultry, clowns, sugarplums, gingerbread people, and candy canes.</p><p>&#x201c;I feel like an idiot,&#x201d; Jackie grumbled. &#x201c;If Kyle dumps me because he sees me in this ridiculous getup, it&#x2019;ll be on your head, Merry Wilkinson.&#x201d;</p><p>I paid her no attention. Jackie always grumbled; it was her natural state. I could only imagine the level of grumbling if she&#x2019;d been left out of our group. She wore a knee-length tunic of gold, turquoise, and forest green over black leggings. Her hat was a foot-high turquoise triangle with a green pom-pom bouncing on the end. Papier&#x2013;m�ch� formed into hornlike appendages and then covered with green felt had been attached to the front of her high-heeled, calf-high boots. Turquoise triangles, outlined in gold glitter, were painted on her cheeks, and her eye shadow was a matching shade of turquoise. I thought the playful makeup brought out my shop assistant&#x2019;s natural beauty much better than the overly applied stuff she normally wore. I kept that opinion to myself.</p><p>&#x201c;Shouldn&#x2019;t you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be helping?&#x201d; I nodded to the line disappearing into the crowd. One of the littlest of the elves was in great danger of wandering off, so enchanted was he by everything going on around him.</p><p>&#x201c;If I must.&#x201d; She sighed heavily, but hurried to take the boy&#x2019;s hand and, with a soft word, guide him back into the line.</p><p>My mother marched at the front, leading the group toward our float. She was singing scales, and even if the children couldn&#x2019;t see over the crowd they should have been able to follow the sound of her voice. My mother had been a diva at the Metropolitan Opera. She knew how to make herself heard.</p><p>I adjusted my mobcap and retied the strings of my apron.</p><p>It was December first and we were assembling for the Santa Claus parade, the biggest event of the year in Rudolph, New York, otherwise known as Christmas Town. If there&#x2019;s one thing we know how to do in Rudolph, it&#x2019;s Christmas.</p><p>I checked behind me for stragglers and then hurried to catch up. The children were from my mom&#x2019;s vocal classes. The youngest ones would sit on the decorated flatbed while the teenagers marched beside, singing carols. They were all dressed in the same colors and style as Jackie, in varying degrees of quality depending on their parents&#x2019; sewing skills. They were elves, and I was Mrs. Claus.</p><p>Jackie had argued for considerably more d�colletage in her elf costume and a much shorter tunic. I&#x2019;d put my foot firmly down on that. Then she stubbornly refused to let her mother make the costume roomy enough to fit over her winter coat. I let her win that one. Jackie could freeze if she wanted to. The children&#x2019;s costumes had been made large enough to fit over winter coats and snowsuits. I wore two wool sweaters under my dress, a pair of thick tights, and heavy socks, all of which added about thirty pounds to my frame. I didn&#x2019;t need thirty pounds, but it was Christmas and if I was going to be Mrs. Claus, I wanted to dress the part.</p><p>Up ahead, I saw Mom climb onto the float. Small children scrambled up after her. The teenagers took their positions and immediately pulled out their smartphones while waiting to begin. Parents milled about snapping pictures.</p><p>&#x201c;Ho, ho, ho,&#x201d; Santa Claus boomed, waving greetings left and right as he walked through the crowd, heading for his own float.</p><p>The youngest children squealed in delight; the teenagers rolled their eyes and continued texting, while the parents clapped their hands and tried to look thrilled.</p><p>It was, of course, not Santa but my dad, the appropriately named Noel. Dad&#x2019;s round stomach was real as was his thick white beard and the shock of white curls only slightly tinged with gray even though he was coming up on sixty. He totally looked the part in the traditional Santa costume of red suit with white fur cuffs, red and white hat, wide black belt, and high black boots.</p><p>I was the last one onto my float. I grabbed my long skirts in one hand; Jackie took the other and hauled me up with as much grace as if she were landing a pike through a hole in the ice.</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone ready?&#x201d; I called. The children cheered. It seemed like we might actually be able to pull this off. This was the first year I owned my own shop in Rudolph, and thus was responsible for my own float, but in the past I&#x2019;d always tried to get home to help with the parade. Other years, we&#x2019;d used a handful of the younger kids from Mom&#x2019;s classes to sit on the float, but this year&#x2014;without consulting me first&#x2014;she decided to make the parade the focus of their fall program. All told, there were thirty children, aged five to seventeen.</p><p>I&#x2019;d decorated the float so it looked like Santa&#x2019;s workshop. It had bales of hay for the elves to sit on, a couple of battered old wooden tables as workbenches, whatever I could scrounge in the way of hammers for tools, and some broken toys that looked like they were still being assembled. It was, I thought proudly, just great. George Mann, a crusty old farmer who&#x2019;d been roped into helping by my dad, provided the tractor that would pull the float. I&#x2019;d tried to get George to dress in costume, but he&#x2019;d looked me in the eye and said, &#x201c;No.&#x201d; I doubted George owned anything but muddy boots, brown overalls, and faded flannel shirts anyway. If anyone asked who he was supposed to be, I&#x2019;d say the farmer in charge of the reindeer.</p><p>I had high hopes for my float. My goal was nothing less than the best in parade trophy.</p><p>One thing we didn&#x2019;t have to concern ourselves with was creating a north pole-like atmosphere. Here on the southern shores of Lake Ontario we get snow. A lot of snow. It was falling now, big fat fluffy flakes. The temperature hovered just below the freezing point and there was no wind; people would be comfortable standing on the sidewalk or sitting on blankets spread out on the curb while waiting for the parade. All the shops, including mine, Mrs. Claus&#x2019;s Treasures, were closed this morning so everyone could participate in the festivities, but the business development office had set up stands at regular intervals to serve hot drinks and baked goods.</p><p>The semiannual Santa Claus parade is the highlight of the tourist year in Rudolph. People come from hundreds of miles away to see it. When I&#x2019;d walked through town this morning, going to check that the float had survived the night, I&#x2019;d noticed that all the hotels and B&amp;Bs had &#x201c;No Vacancy&#x201d; signs outside. That would make everyone happy. I say semiannual parade, because we have one in July also. What the heck, gotta get those marks, I mean tourists, to town somehow.</p><p>The parade assembly area was in the parking lot behind the town&#x2019;s community center. This morning the lot was a churning mass of adults and children in costume, marching bands, flags, floats, some definitely better than others, and tractors to pull them.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, kids, give us a smile,&#x201d; a voice called out. Russ Durham, editor in chief of the<i> Rudolph Gazette</i>, lifted his camera, and the giggling children struck a pose. Jackie, supposedly embarrassed to be seen in her costume, leapt to her feet and cocked a hip as the camera clicked.</p><p>At an unseen signal, engines at the front of the line roared to life. Marchers stamped their feet. Trumpeters and French horn players blew into their instruments. Children applauded and the high school cheerleaders did cartwheels.</p><p>Nothing, however, seemed to be happening at the front of my float. I clambered up onto a bale of hay and peered through the plastic-wrap windows. George was in the tractor&#x2019;s seat, where he should be.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get going,&#x201d; I called.</p><p>He shrugged, not bothering to turn around. He might have said something but I couldn&#x2019;t hear over the noise of the parade starting. Then, to my horror, George got out of his seat and jumped to the ground. He opened the flap at the front of the tractor and his head disappeared into its mysterious depths.</p><p>My heart dropped into my stomach. I made my way through jabbering kids and climbed off the back of the float.</p><p>Russ had gone to see what George was up to. When I reached the engine, the two men were scratching their heads.</p><p>&#x201c;Your kids look great,&#x201d; Russ said to me. His accent was slow and sexy, full of the color and spice of Louisiana.</p><p>&#x201c;They sure do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So do you.&#x201d; He gave me a smile full of dancing hazel eyes and straight white teeth.</p><p>&#x201c;I do not. I look like a harassed old lady.&#x201d; I peered at him through my spectacles. The frames contained nothing but plain glass, part of the costume. I&#x2019;d stuffed my black hair inside the red and white checked mobcap that came complete with attached white curls.</p><p>&#x201c;A beautiful harassed old lady, then,&#x201d; he said. I felt my color rise. Hopefully Russ would think the red cheeks were part of the costume.</p><p>But I had more important things to worry about right then than how I looked. &#x201c;Please, please don&#x2019;t tell me there&#x2019;s a problem,&#x201d; I begged George.</p><p>&#x201c;Darn thing won&#x2019;t start,&#x201d; the old farmer replied.</p><p>&#x201c;It has to start!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the holdup there?&#x201d; someone called.</p><p>The floats near the beginning of the parade, where we were, represented a toymaker&#x2019;s front window, a candy store, a turkey farm, a groaning dinner table, and the stable in Bethlehem. The quilters&#x2019; guild had red and green quilts arranged on their laps, and the high school marching band members were grinches. The book clubbers wore long skirts and bonnets and were led by Ralph Dickerson, wearing a nightgown and cap and carrying a candlestick. The role of Scrooge definitely suited Ralph, the town&#x2019;s budget chief.</p><p>It all looked like total chaos, but the town had been doing this for almost twenty years and they had it down pat.</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you try it again?&#x201d; Russ helpfully suggested.</p><p>&#x201c;Been tryin&#x2019;,&#x201d; George replied.</p><p>A man vaulted over the bar at the back of the toymaker&#x2019;s float, the one directly in front of mine, and landed lightly on his feet, his movements a considerable contrast to his appearance. He looked to be about ninety years old with his enormous gray mustache and sideburns, nose accented by a lump of putty holding up his glasses, and an outfit of woolen jacket, knee-length breeches, and shoes with buckles, but I knew he was a thirty-year-old by the name of Alan Anderson; occupation, toymaker. Alan was the second-most popular man in Rudolph, after Santa, but only when wearing his toymaker regalia. He was tall and handsome with blond hair that curled around the back of his neck, sparkling blue eyes, and a ready laugh, but he could be quite shy, and he preferred to go incognito, so to speak.</p><p>Alan and I had dated for a short while in high school. It didn&#x2019;t last after graduation. He&#x2019;d been happy to remain in Rudolph, learning woodworking from his father and making beautiful things, slowly and carefully. I had stars in my eyes as I planned a fast-paced life in the hectic, exciting magazine world of Manhattan. We&#x2019;d each got what we wanted, but one of us&#x2014;me&#x2014;had given up the dream and returned to Rudolph.</p><p>I&#x2019;d wondered briefly if the old spark might be rekindled, but December in Christmas Town was not a time to be courting. We were all too darn busy.</p><p>Alan gave me a smile before going to join George and Russ. &#x201c;Need any help here?&#x201d; He also stared into the depths of the tractor engine, the three men looking as though it would start if only they focused hard enough.</p><p>George&#x2019;s tractor might have been at its best during World War II, but that was no reason for it to give up the ghost now. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you do some kind of temporary fix?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>George didn&#x2019;t dignify that comment with a reply. Russ looked confused&#x2014;I guessed engines were not his thing, but he didn&#x2019;t like to admit it. Alan patted his pockets as if he might find exactly the right tool.</p><p>Jingle Bell Lane, Rudolph&#x2019;s main street, down which the parade would pass, was out of sight of those of us at the back of the community center, but we could hear the excited murmur of expectation.</p><p>I groaned. George continued to scratch his chin.</p><p>Alan threw me an apologetic look. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Merry, but I have to get back. We&#x2019;re about to leave.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said, forcing out a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you, uh, going to the post-parade party?&#x201d; He shuffled his feet in their buckled shoes.</p><p>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t miss it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps I&#x2019;ll see you there. Good luck with the float.&#x201d;</p><p>I might have spent a moment wondering if Alan merely meant he&#x2019;d be at the party, or if he was trying to say something deeper, but one of the orange vest&#x2013;wearing marshals arrived at a trot. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on, Merry? You have to get moving.&#x201d;</p><p>I waved my arms. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t start. We can&#x2019;t push the dratted thing.&#x201d; In the line behind me, drivers began shouting at us to get out of the way. I could see the front of the parade turning into the street. I wanted to cry.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to walk,&#x201d; Russ said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get the kids down.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But my float! All my work.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing you can do about that now, Merry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What,&#x201d; my mother sang, &#x201c;is happening down there?&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Over in the Ocean: In a Coral Reef (Simply Nature Books)</h2><p>This irresistible, playful counting book introduces children to creatures of the coral reef as they clap to the rhythm of <em>Over in the Meadow</em>.

Marshall (1867&#x2013;1941) was a British author, particularly well known for her works of popular national history for children. She was born in Bo'ness, Scotland, and her father was John Marshall JP, an earthenware manufacturer. She was educated at a girls' boarding school called Laurel Bank, in Melrose. Between 1901 and 1904 she was the superintendent of a hall of residence for female students at Glasgow University, but, otherwise, she appears to have made her living throughout her life by writing. She was unmarried. As is made clear by the Prefaces of her books from time to time, she travelled extensively after 1904, including to Melbourne, California and China, although her obituary in The Times stated that she spent most of her life in Oxford and in London, where she died. H. E. Marshall is famous for her 1905 children's history of England, Our Island Story: A History of England for Boys and Girls, illustrated by A. S. Forrest. In the USA the book was entitled An Island Story. The book was a bestseller, was printed in numerous editions, and for fifty years was the standard and much-loved book by which children learned the history of England. However a lot of this book is historically inaccurate, much of it uses Shakespeare's plays for historical sources, like the section of Richard III is really a summary of the play.[citation needed] The book is still to be found in schools and homes, but the last printing was in 1953 and it went out of print in the 1960s. In 2005, an alliance of the Civitas think-tank and various national newspapers brought the book back into print, with the aim of sending a free copy to each of the UK's primary schools. Readers of The Daily Telegraph contributed �25,000 to the cost of the reprint.</p><h2>The House of Mondavi: The Rise and Fall of an American Wine Dynasty</h2><p><b>An epic, scandal-plagued story of the immigrant family that built&#x2014;and then spectacularly lost&#x2014;a global wine empire</b><p>Set in California&#x2019;s lush Napa Valley and spanning four generations of a talented and visionary family, <i>The House of Mondavi</i> is a tale of genius, sibling rivalry, and betrayal. From 1906, when Italian immigrant Cesare Mondavi passed through Ellis Island, to the Robert Mondavi Corp.&#x2019;s twenty-first-century battle over a billion-dollar fortune, award-winning journalist Julia Flynn brings to life both the place and the people in this riveting family drama.</p><p>The blood feuds are as spectacular as the business triumphs. Cesare&#x2019;s sons, Robert and Peter, literally came to blows in the 1960s during a dispute touched off by the purchase of a mink coat, resulting in Robert&#x2019;s exile from the family&#x2014;and his subsequent founding of a winery that would set off a revolution in American winemaking. Robert&#x2019;s sons, Michael and Timothy, as passionate in their own ways as their visionary father, waged battle with each other for control of the company before Michael&#x2019;s expansive ambitions ultimately led to a board coup and the sale of the business to an international conglomerate.</p><p>A meticulously reported narrative based on thousands of hours of interviews,&nbsp;<i>The House of Mondavi</i>&nbsp;is bound to become a classic.</p></p><p><b>Julia Flynn Siler</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The House of Mondavi</i>.

An award-winning journalist, she lives in Northern California with her husband and two sons. Please visit juliaflynnsiler.com for more information.How did a family business, a billion-dollar enterprise such as the House of Mondavi, find itself open to a hostile takeover? Was it hubris, bad financial management, or a bit of both? Listening to Alan Sklar is always worthwhile, but with a story this fraught with biblical dimensions and Elizabethan complexities, he absolutely enthralls. Even with ambition, sibling rivalry, betrayal, and exile as staples of the story, Sklar doesnt overdramatize. His sensitive narration does more than air the familys wine-spotted linens in public. Thanks to Silers meticulous research, through interviews with all principal family members, court documents, and depositions, and Sklars vibrant performance, the story doesnt deteriorate into a soap opera. Instead it offers fascinating insights into a dysfunctional family and the wine-growing industry in Napa.

Demi's gilded artwork brings Nicholas to life in a way sure to mesmerize readers new to the story of this fascinating and important historical figure.</p><p><b>Demi</b> is the award-winning creator of numerous books for children, including <i>The Empty Pot</i>;<i> Buddha</i>;<i> The Dalai Lama</i>;<i> The Legend of Saint Nicholas</i>;<i> Gandhi</i>, which was named a <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated Book and received an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Platinum Award; and <i>Muhammad</i>, which was named a Kirkus Reviews Editors&#x2019; Choice selection, a Booklist Editors&#x2019; Choice selection, one of the Booklist Top Ten Religion Books for Youth, and a Book Links &#x201c;Lasting Connections&#x201d; selection, and was cited in a <i>Publishers Weekly</i> starred review as a &#x201c;timely, exceptionally handsome biography [that] serves as an excellent introduction to Islam.&#x201d; Demi lives in Carnation, Washington.Gr. 2-5. Children who think Santa Claus when they hear the name St. Nicholas will be surprised to hear the true story of the man who became the church's youngest bishop and the patron saint of butchers and prisoners as well as children. Born with spiritual gifts (at one day old, he stood in his bath and prayed to God!), Nicholas, in Buddhalike fashion, was distressed by the sorrow in the world and made it his mission to relieve suffering. Often he did this using miraculous means, saving sailors as an apparition and resurrecting three children who had been killed and pickled in brine to be served as food. Even middle-grade readers, the best audience for this, may be confused by some of the church-laden intricacies of the narrative, but the pictures are delightfully Demi. Representative scenes, set against buff-colored pages, burst through their gilded frames, and careful design work is evident right through to the endpapers, which show how Santa Claus is represented in various countries. Lovely and informative. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She enjoyed the early mornings in Venice, before the summer crowds flooded into the city. She watched pigeons peck the ground for yesterday&#x2019;s crumbs, watched a row of tethered gondolas bob in the heavy sea swell. There would be a storm soon&#x2014;she tasted it in the air. She looked at her watch. It was time to go. Her client had instructed her to take a water taxi to the San Zaccaria dock, then walk to the house.<br> <br>She should have been on her way before now, but she&#x2019;d waited there on the bridge to see who was following her. Even though she hadn&#x2019;t seen anyone yet, she&#x2019;d felt eyes on her, felt them since her plane had landed an hour earlier. At the airport&#x2019;s dock she&#x2019;d caught a glimpse of one of them: a man&#x2014;dark sunglasses, a slouchy work jacket. There were probably others, but where were they? She hated being in the open like this&#x2014;a target&#x2014;and the large tube in her hand a target as well. She still didn&#x2019;t see anyone.<br> <br>She bent down to adjust the strap of her sandal. From the corner of her eye she saw him. She was sure it was the same man she&#x2019;d seen at the Marco Polo airport, still wearing sunglasses and a jacket. He wasn&#x2019;t very good at his job, since she&#x2019;d spotted him, standing in the alley to the left of the Hotel Danieli, chewing on a toothpick like he didn&#x2019;t have a care in the world. But where were the others? She knew she hadn&#x2019;t been followed to Venice, she was sure of that, so why now? For some reason, her client didn&#x2019;t trust her. She felt a lick of anger. It was an insult to her reputation. Or perhaps someone knew what was inside the large tube and wanted it?<br> <br>Ah, there he was, the second man, hovering near the dock, a cap pulled low on his head, wearing wrinkled jeans and scuffed boots. Both men were in their thirties, muscled, garbed in everyday working clothes. Thugs. One was tall, the other short. Mutt and Jeff. She saw no one else. Only two of them? Another insult. She took note of the small sign above Mr. Short&#x2019;s head&#x2014;Calle de la Rasse.<br> <br>Kitsune had learned the complicated layout of the Venetian streets, an integral part of her preparation, since she could run much faster than she could swim.<br> <br>She checked the men out again. Both cocky, sure of themselves, but she could take them. Easily.<br> <br>Not yet, though. The time wasn&#x2019;t right.<br> <br>Their presence bothered her. Why the sudden distrust from her client? Her reputation was built on absolute discretion, always delivering what was commissioned and never asking questions. She had no false modesty. She could steal anything, anywhere&#x2014;even the Koh-i-Noor diamond, that magnificent bloody stone that had nearly gotten her killed. A pity she&#x2019;d had to give it up.<br> <br>This client was paying her a small fortune, and half of it, five million euros, was already deposited in four different accounts in four different banks, as was her custom. She would receive the other five million upon delivery. All of it was straightforward, so why the two thugs following her?<br> <br>Kitsune had been a thief for too long to ignore the prickle of unease that went down her neck. The tube was heavy, and she hugged it closer.<br> <br>The breeze picked up between the Venetian buildings, blowing gently down the narrow canal. She continued forward, over the small bridge, up the walkway, past the arriving gondoliers, who watched her and wondered. Grant told her she moved differently, with singular grace and arrogance, and she looked like what she was&#x2014;strong and dangerous&#x2014;and then he&#x2019;d held her close, stroked her long hair, and whispered against her temple that only the very stupid, or the very desperate, would mess with her. She felt a warm punch to her heart thinking of her husband of ten months, how the green of his eyes turned nearly black when he was kissing her. Soon, she would be with him again. She would give the prize to the client, and be gone.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d fulfilled the first part of the job three days earlier, when she&#x2019;d pulled off one of the most fun heists of her career. She&#x2019;d dyed her hair the deepest black, worn brown contacts, and used a semipermanent stain to make her skin appear two shades deeper, a process she didn&#x2019;t relish, but it helped her blend in beautifully with the population of Istanbul. With her forged credentials, which included a signature from Turkish military leader Hulusi Akar, the palace authorities had followed orders and assigned her to work security at the Topkapi Palace. It had taken her more than three months to work her way out of the harem complex and into special security in the Holy Relics exhibit, where Moses&#x2019;s staff was displayed.<br> <br>Her arms had gotten tired carrying the H&amp;K MP5 machine gun all day. Even with the strap around her neck and shoulder, the carbine got heavy, and being on alert for twelve hours at a time was exhausting. Despite the heat and grit and the hordes of tourists trooping in and out of the treasure-filled rooms in the palace, her assigned areas gave her a lovely view of the Bosphorus. The sun shined on the water, sprinkling diamonds, the sea breezes cooled her, and the tourists gathered nearby to take photos. She was careful, very careful, never to get in the shots. It wouldn&#x2019;t do to have someone post a photo of her on Facebook accidentally, have some government drone monitoring the Internet run the photos through facial recognition, and blow her cover.<br> <br>She wondered again: did her unknown client really believe that what she carried in her hands was the very embodiment of power? That what she carried wasn&#x2019;t simply an ancient knob of wood but the actual staff of Moses? Or, as some called it, Aaron&#x2019;s rod? No matter what it was called, this staff was one of the most sought-after and priceless artifacts in the world, and she&#x2019;d managed to break into the Holy Relics exhibit after hours and take the staff out of its lighted case after cutting the wires to the security alarm, and disappeared. And that brought a smile of satisfaction.<br> <br>No more inky-black hair, no more dark brown eyes, the stain washed away. She was back to her blue eyes, her white skin, and her own dark hair.<br> <br>Yes, it had been a clean, perfectly executed job. One of her best, and she, the Fox, had a string of risky, daring jobs behind her.<br> <br>The international news channels were still leading with the theft. No way was she going to take a chance of being caught in the crosshairs. She&#x2019;d make the delivery, get her other five million, go home to Capri, and talk Grant into visiting Australia or America, anywhere away from Europe. He was due for a vacation, having spent the last three months in Afghanistan guarding a high-ranking British officer.<br> <br>The house she was going to was only a drop site. She&#x2019;d used this protocol many times&#x2014;empty house, the owners probably on vacation. Clients rarely wanted the Fox to know where they lived. She wondered who would be there to receive the stolen staff.<br> <br>A winding alleyway took her deeper into the neighborhoods, along the canals. And there it was, a simple, classic Venetian home&#x2014;red brick, the second and third floors balconied, set between a narrow street and a small canal.<br> <br>She went up the steps, knocked on the dark green door. Waited a moment before the thick, old wood swung open. An older man in a dark suit and silver tie told her to come in.<br> <br>Inside, all was silent. She followed him through a small courtyard, a marble fountain at its center. He showed her into a parlor, to the right of the fountain. The door closed behind her.<br> <br>The room was empty, the silence heavy. She heard voices, a man and a woman, somewhere nearby&#x2014;above her, probably&#x2014;speaking rapid Italian. The clients? Although she understood exactly what they were saying, it still made no sense to her.<br> <br>The woman said clearly, excitement in her voice, &#x201c;I wish I could see it, the Gobi sands&#x2014;a tsunami sweeping over Beijing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We will see it on video,&#x201d; came a man&#x2019;s matter-of-fact voice. &#x201c;All the sand, do you think? Could Grandfather be that good?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know he is. And we will see the aftermath for ourselves. We will leave in three days, after things have calmed down.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man said, marveling, &#x201c;Can you imagine, we are the ones to drain the Gobi?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kitsune stood silently, listening. She shook her head. Drain the Gobi Desert dry? All that sand covering Beijing? By their grandfather? What she&#x2019;d heard, it was nuts, made no sense. An image of Moses raising his staff, parting the Red Sea so the Israelites could escape the Egyptian army flashed through her mind. It was a famous image, given all the paintings and movies, and there were many who believed that was exactly what happened. But not her.<br> <br>Kitsune held by her side a gnarly old piece of wood the Turks had stolen when they&#x2019;d plundered Egypt in 1517, audacious enough or credulous enough to proclaim it to be Moses&#x2019;s staff. She didn&#x2019;t care if it was real or not, it didn&#x2019;t matter. Ten million euros would keep her in bikinis for a long time. She pictured Moses again, only this time she saw him waving his staff to send the sands flying out of the Gobi Desert. Such a strange image.<br> <br>The voices faded away.<br> <br>Moments later, the door to the parlor opened and a man came in. He was short, with dark hair and flat black eyes. This one, in spite of his well-cut dark suit, his perfectly polished boots, couldn&#x2019;t be the client. He looked coarse, crude, a lieutenant playing dress-up. Another thug, only this one with a bit of power, probably running the other who&#x2019;d followed her. So the man and woman she&#x2019;d heard talking wanted him to handle the transaction, then bring them the staff. Fine by her. All she wanted was her money.<br> <br>He crossed the room to the small desk, picked up a silver lighter, and touched it to the end of a cigarette. He blew out a stream of gray smoke and said, in passable English, &#x201c;I am Antonio Pazzi, and you are the Fox. You have the package?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Kitsune set the tube on the desk and stepped back. Pazzi pulled a stiletto from his coat pocket, slit open the top of the cylinder, and upended it. The well-wrapped staff slid out into his waiting hand. He reverently laid it atop the desk and peeled off the packing. He looked at the staff, motionless, staring, but not touching it. Finally, he looked up at her, smiled widely, showing yellow tobacco-stained teeth. &#x201c;I did not believe you would be able to steal this precious rod from the Topkapi. Your reputation is deserved. My masters will be pleased.&#x201d;<br> <br>She saw him press a small button on the desk, and in the next instant she heard a door close, a boat&#x2019;s engine fire to life. So he&#x2019;d signaled the client that she&#x2019;d brought the staff? And they&#x2019;d left. Pazzi handed her a long white envelope. &#x201c;Five million euros. You will leave now.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if she wanted to stay, maybe have a drink with this oily cretin with his yellow teeth. She wanted to open the envelope, but he kept smiling, herding her toward the door, and she felt that familiar shiver down her neck and went on red alert, her body flexed and ready to spring. Were the two men outside the door, waiting for her? Pazzi gave her a small salute, and at the last moment, he slipped past her and slammed the door behind him. She heard the key turn in the lock. In the next moment, another door opened, this time behind her. Mutt and Jeff stepped through, and both held guns in their hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;What a lovely surprise,&#x201d; she said in Italian, and, quick as a cobra, she dove at Mutt&#x2019;s feet. He had been expecting her to run, and he hesitated a moment. She rolled into him and knocked him backward, his arms flailing for purchase, and he fell against a chair. She popped back to her feet&#x2014;Mutt on her left, struggling to get back up, and Jeff on her right, his Beretta aimed at her chest.<br> <br>Kitsune fell to her knees, whipped out her two Walther PPKs cross-armed, and pulled the triggers almost before she&#x2019;d squared the sights. Jeff fired at the same time. If she&#x2019;d stayed standing, she&#x2019;d be dead. Now he was the one who was dead, sprawled on his back on the floor, blood blooming from his chest. She&#x2019;d missed Mutt, but his gun had clattered to the floor and slid under a red velvet sofa. He sprang to his feet and came at her, fast and hard, fists up and flying, trying to knock the gun away and kill her with his bare hands. He was fast, she&#x2019;d give him that, but she was faster. A heartbeat later he was on the floor with a hole in his forehead.<br> <br>Kitsune had never used guns, but in the past few months, Grant had trained her in them, and trained her well. And when he was satisfied, he&#x2019;d given her the two Walthers. Almost as if Grant had known she would need them. She sent him a silent thank-you as she pointed the gun in her right hand over her shoulder, toward the locked door, just in case, and walked to the opposite side of the room. She listened but didn&#x2019;t hear anything. The house had gone silent. Too silent. As if someone was listening. She had to get out of there, now.<br> <br>She heard voices shouting. She yanked open the door and ran down a long hallway ending in a staircase. The house itself was narrow and old, the walls cool gray stone. She had no choice but to run up the stairs.<br> <br>She heard feet pounding after her, shouts growing closer. Kitsune burst through onto a rooftop terrace. Up this high, she saw that terraces littered the rooftops, and the Venetian houses were crammed cheek by jowl, separated by the small canals that crisscrossed Venice.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t look down at the murky canal below, paid no attention to the shouts from the staircase, as men ran up to the terrace. She leaped across to the neighboring terrace. She felt a bullet whiz by her ear, and she dropped and rolled, was on her feet in a second, running to the next terrace. She heard the man leap after her, moving fast, gaining on her. She raced to the end of the rooftop and leaped again, barely missed a window box overflowing with pink and red geraniums, and skidded along the pebbled roof.<br> <br>He followed her, shouting, shooting. People screamed through open windows, gondoliers looked at the sight and shouted, tourists stared up in awe as light-footed Kitsune soared over them like a bird in flight. Laundry lines tumbled into the water below. She was careful to avoid the electric lines; she&#x2019;d be dead and gone before she hit the water if she grabbed one of those by accident.<br> <br>She looked back, saw that it was Pazzi chasing her. She hadn&#x2019;t expected him to be so fast, but he was reaching his limits, and dropping back. With a yell of frustration, he took another shot. The bullet skimmed her arm, cutting the fabric of her shirt, stinging like mad. Blood began running down, turning her hand red. Not good.<br> <br>She made a last desperate leap, grabbed a laundry line, swung down and smashed against the wall of a redbrick house, knocking the air out of her lungs, and dropped, hard, onto the deck of a water taxi.<br> <br>The captain, gap-mouthed, stumbled back, and she pushed him overboard, roared the engine to life and took off. She heard shouts, curses behind her, but didn&#x2019;t look back. She pressed her right hand against the wound in her upper arm.<br> <br>The boat shot out by the San Zaccaria vaporetto station. She was free now, in the lagoon, and she gunned it.<br> <br>She was breathing hard, and bleeding, but for the moment, she was upright and safe, cool water splashing her, the wind tearing through her ...</p><h2>Teachings on Love</h2><p>Weaving together traditional stories, personal experiences, and a deep understanding of the Buddha's way of mindful living, Thich Nhat Hanh provides step-by-step practices that foster understanding and intimacy in any relationship and extend our love even to those that cause us pain. <i>Teachings on Love</i> is a treasure-trove of guidance for couples, co-workers, or friends who wish to nourish the gift and strength of their relationships and deal creatively with their weaknesses and difficulties. We all yearn to experience a love that is deeper and more joyful. <i>Teachings on Love</i> provides a time-tested path that anyone can follow to nurture the deepest love in ourselves and others.<br><br>With a new introductory chapter by Thich Nhat Hanh</p><p>For venerated Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh, love is more than an emotion. Drawing on millennia of Buddhist wisdom and his own therapeutic methods, <i>Teachings on Love</i> further develops his practical notion of interbeing in terms of love. If all things are interrelated, what could be more paramount to negotiating those relations than love? And more than just a way of relating, love is a way of living: "Love by the way you walk, the way you sit, the way you eat." Nhat Hanh supports his practical advice with numerous verses for enhancing mindfulness, prostrations for expressing reverence, and succinct formulas, such as the Five Awarenesses and the Five Mindfulness Trainings. The fifth mindfulness training exemplifies the broad scope of Nhat Hanh's love: "Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful consumption, I am committed to cultivating good health, both physical and mental, for myself, my family, and my society by practicing mindful eating, drinking, and consuming." Thich Nhat Hanh forever writes with reassuring warmth, from which readers may derive insight as well as comfort. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>According to Buddhist tradition, our mindful presence in the moment opens the door to every possibility. It is the key to lasting transformation in all areas of our lives--at work, in worship, even in love. On Teachings on Love, Thich Nhat Hanh, Nobel Peace Prize nominee and the author of over 75 books, explores how to shine the light of awareness into our intimate relationships.</p><h2>The Middle Eastern Vegetarian Cookbook</h2><p><p><strong>2017 James Beard Foundation Book Awards Winner: Vegetable Cooking</strong></p><p><strong>A collection of vegetarian dishes influenced by Middle Eastern flavors from Salma Hage, author of the bestselling classic, <em>The Lebanese Kitchen</em>, also published by Phaidon.</strong></p><p>A definitive, fresh and approachable collection of 150 traditional recipes from an authoritative voice on Middle Eastern home cooking, Salma Hage&#x2019;s new book is in line with the current Western trends of consciously reducing meat, and the ancient Middle Eastern culture of largely vegetarian, mezze style dining.</p><p>Traditionally, the Middle Eastern diet consisted largely of vegetables, fruits, herbs, spices, pulses, grains and legumes.

While it's easy enough to see that consequences are important (where would we be without positive reinforcement?), few have heard there's a science of consequences, with principles that affect us every day.&nbsp; Despite their variety, consequences appear to follow a common set of scientific principles and share some similar effects in the brain--such as the "pleasure centers."&nbsp; Nature and nurture always work together, and scientists have demonstrated that learning from consequences predictably activates genes and restructures the brain.&nbsp; Applications are everywhere--at home, at work, and at school, and that's just for starters.&nbsp; Individually and societally, for example, self-control pits short-term against long-term <i>consequences</i>.&nbsp; Ten years in the making, <i>The Science of Consequences </i>tells a tale ranging from genetics to neurotransmitters, from emotion to language, from parenting to politics, taking an inclusive interdisciplinary approach to show how something so deceptively simple can help make sense of so much. <br><br>The award-winning book received advance praise from well-known experts in genetics, neuroscience, and economics, as well as in psychology, behavior analysis, and animal training. Recognition included coverage in the international scientific journal <i>Nature, The Scientist </i>magazine, and <i>Science News.&nbsp; </i></p><p>Learning researcher and developmental psychobiologist Susan Schneider has an international reputation in nature-nurture relations and the science of consequences.&nbsp; She was fortunate to be a friend of B. F. Skinner, the sage of positive reinforcement.&nbsp; Schneider's twenty-five years of research and teaching produced numerous scientific studies and theoretical articles, including pioneering work on generalization and choice.&nbsp; Currently a visiting scholar at the University of the Pacific, Schneider has been a professor at St. Olaf College, Auburn University, and Florida International University, and a visiting research fellow at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.&nbsp; She obtained her graduate education from Brown University and the University of Kansas."A wide-ranging and highly entertaining guide to the many ways that the behavior of humans and other animals&#x2014;from bugs to bonobos&#x2014;is shaped by consequences. . . .

And, she avers, such insights can inform real-life applications, from the treatment of depression to solving global issues such as overfishing."<br><i>&#x2014;Nature</i><br><br>"A remarkable book.

The lesson: Play it safe. Listen to the experts. It was the perfect propaganda for the industrial economy. What boss wouldn&#x2019;t want employees to believe that obedience and conformity are the keys to success?</p><p></p><p>But we tend to forget that Icarus was also warned not to fly too low, because seawater would ruin the lift in his wings. Flying too low is even more dangerous than flying too high, because it feels deceptively safe.</p><p></p><p>The safety zone has moved. Conformity no longer leads to comfort. But the good news is that creativity is scarce and more valuable than ever. So is choosing to do something unpredictable and brave: Make art. Being an artist isn&#x2019;t a genetic disposition or a specific talent. It&#x2019;s an attitude we can all adopt. It&#x2019;s a hunger to seize new ground, make connections, and work without a map.

In this respect, <i>The Flip</i> is similar to <i>The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher</i> by Lewis Thomas. . . . The research incorporated into the book is well thought out, and ranges from writer Philip K. Dick to mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. Kripal even discusses how Joni Mitchell came up with the idea that &#x2018;we are stardust&#x2019; ten years before Carl Sagan popularized it. . . . <i>The Flip</i> did open my mind to the fact that there are leading experts in both the field of science <i>and</i> religion (Kripal himself) who are pushing toward unification and the extinction of out-dated knowledge.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i><b>NewPages</b></i></p><p>&#x201c;In <i>The Flip</i>, Jeffrey J. Kripal reflects deeply on non-ordinary experiences that transform people&#x2019;s way of understanding themselves and the world. Kripal uses an imaginative transdisciplinary method that weaves together contemporary thought in ecology, quantum physics, evolutionary biology, philosophy of mind, comparative mysticism, and first-person experiential accounts. The result is an eminently readable manifesto for the role of the humanities in integrating emergent thought in these many domains. Prophetically, the larger goal is nothing less than transforming humanity toward a greater wisdom community that can move beyond many of our most intractable problems and dysfunctions.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Bradley Lewis</b>, author of <i>Narrative Psychiatry: How Stories Can Shape Clinical Practice</i> and <i>Depression: Integrating Science, Humanities, and Culture</i></p><p>&#x201c;Kripal is one of the most important voices pushing the academy to broaden its perspective beyond the secular: to take seriously the idea that reality is more complex.

The same picture is on all of them: a stick figure, its arms aloft, its circle head drowning in a set of triangle waves. CAUTION, the signs read. DANGEROUS UNDERTOW.<br><br>We ignore it. We've gone out at Makaha and Makapu'u before. We've felt Yokes pull us under. We are not afraid of the beaches and breaks here in Waikiki. We are careless, in fact, brazen. So when we see her studying the warning, chewing the right side of her lip, we laugh. Jus' like da kine, scared of da water. Haoles, yeah.<br><br>The tourist girl is white. They're all white to us unless they're black. She has light brown hair, a pointed nose, eyebrows neatly plucked into a firm line. She wears a white bikini with red polka dots. Triangle-cut top, ruffled bottom. We shake our heads at her. Our 'ehu hair, pulled into ponytails, bounces against our necks. Our bikinis are carefully cut pieces with cross-back straps and lean bottoms. We surf in these, sista. We don't have time for ruffles and ruching. But she does, like every other tourist. Her blue-and-white-striped hotel towel labels her for what she is.<br><br>So why do we look at her as we pass? Why do we notice her out of the hundreds of others? Do we already know she's marked, special in some way?<br><br>At the high tide line Cora Jones and Kaila Ka'awa pull on rashguards to protect against the trade winds, which are wailing this morning. The rest of us pretend we don't have chicken skin. We strap our leashes to our ankles, careful to piece the Velcro together, and then we jump on our boards and feel them skim across the surface of the water. Arching our backs, our hips pressed into hard fiberglass, we dig the water with our hands. We raise one foot for balance, and because we know we are silhouetted against the horizon, we hold our heads high, we point our toes. Our bodies curve upward, like smiles, beckoning those on shore to follow.<br><br>When we look back, the tourist girl is approaching the ocean's edge. She walks into the water, the small waves lapping at her feet, ankles, knees, chest. We see her dip her shoulders into the whitewash. We don't tell her to stay away from the retaining wall in front of Baby Queens or that today the current is moving from 'Ewa to Diamond Head. We paddle, and in a moment, we've left her behind.<br>Only local folks leave us money, placing it on top of the television in an envelope with the word "Housekeeping" printed across the front. We split the cash, tucking it into our shoes where management won't look for it.<br><br>We, the women of Housekeeping, get left other things, too, but by accident. The Japanese leave behind useful items: tubes of sunscreen, beach floaties, snorkel gear, unopened boxes of cereal, half-filled bottles of American whiskey, brand-new packets of travel tissues decorated with Choco-Cat and Hello Kitty, which our youngest girls love. The tissues we take. Even when management checks the pockets of our uniforms, they never think to confiscate packets of tissues. We don't get in trouble for bringing those home. The rest we throw into trash bags or hide on the bottom shelf of our carts to leave at the loading dock for night security. Management doesn't check their pockets.<br><br>What mainland Americans leave behind makes us blush: used condoms under the bed, a turquoise bra with thick cups like soup bowls, pornographic magazines. We find a single blue sandal, a hairbrush tangled with yellow hair, a vibrating toothbrush, a stuffed bear with a missing arm and glass eyes. Such intimate pieces to forget.<br><br>Today we have been cleaning rooms for five hours, since six in the morning. Tucking the bottom sheets at least eight times, disinfecting the sinks and bathtubs, vacuuming the dark brown carpets. We have cleaned twelve rooms and have eight more to go. We pause in the hallway. We don't have time to rest, but we do anyway, just for a moment. The door to room 254 is open, and we watch a young woman tie a white wrap around her waist. Her polka-dot bathing suit is damp and turns the white fabric sheer, the red dots shining through like mosquito bites. She catches us watching her. "You don't need to replace the towels," she says, smiling. "Conserve water." Her teeth are coins, flat and shiny. We want to tell her to wear a thicker skirt, but it's not our place to speak to guests.<br><br>A young man appears from behind the wall and walks around the foot of the bed: "I already left mine on the floor."<br><br>The girl rolls her eyes. "Then pick it up," she scolds. She turns to give us an exasperated smile, and we are reminded of our eldest daughters: impatient with nonsense, bossing their brothers, keeping the house. This girl, like our girls, is the type a mother can depend on to do things: drive Grandmother to a doctor's appointment, cook breakfast for Papa, dress and feed the babies before school. We smile back at her. We feel as if we can trust her.<br><br>The young man finally emerges from the bedroom--shoelaces untied, hat pulled low over his eyes--and she smacks him lightly on the arm. "You take longer than a girl," she says. She laughs, a light, tinkling giggle. He laughs. They look at us, so we laugh. At the end of the hall, she turns and waves at us. We nod, small smiles tightening our lips, and then we enter the room to make the beds.<br><br>We think of her for the rest of our shift, chuckling at her bossiness and cheer. When we return our carts, the manager doesn't bother to check our pockets, which makes this a good day, and we decide the American girl has brought us luck.<br><br>The hotel is strict about a great number of our activities. They have rules on how to store the carts, what time to punch in, what time to punch out, how to answer the phone (always start with "Aloha"), how to arrange the pillows on the bed, how to report suspicious activity. The last rule was created to fight terrorism, though we wonder what kind of terrorists would stay in Waikiki. In fact, we don't entirely understand this rule or trust it. It seems designed only to make trouble for us. We've heard stories, after all, stories about workers like us who tried to obey the rule. Stories like the one about Janora Cabrera, who saw a man pressing a woman against a wall and reaching up her skirt on the penthouse floor. Janora told her shift manager about what she had seen. The shift manager reported it to the night auditor, who deferred to the daytime manager. Together, they reprimanded Janora. "You are only to report suspicious behavior," they told her. "You are not to involve yourself with our guests' lives."<br><br>Our shift ends at two in the afternoon, and we exit the hotel from the basement, a hot tunnel that smells of dryer sheets. This is where the housekeeping office is located and where we are kept, tucked away from the visitors who wander in and out of the front lobby. From here we cannot hear their sandals clap against the polished marble floors nor see their eyes widen as they first glimpse the Pacific through the glass windows of the lanai. We exit onto a sidewalk spotted with old gum stains and the faint red splatter of a spilled shave ice.<br><br>At the bus stop, waiting to go home, we laugh with one another. We talk of our husbands and our children. How fast they grow, our little ones, how quickly they move through school, through friends, through clothes. Already the youngest speak more English than we do, and the eldest make plans to go to college. We're proud of them, scared for them. We want them to go. We want them to stay in the house to help us. We even want, in some small part of our hearts, to send them back home to Pohnpei or Yap or Kosrae so they can really learn what it means to be one of us. Already they are American.<br><br>On the ride home, our shoulders ache and our shoes feel tight around our swollen feet. We close our eyes and let the bus's air-conditioning wash over us like a wave.<br>We tap the gas pedal, then hit the brakes again. Our cars lurch to a stop. Our heels and briefcases slide across the passenger seat, and one shoe drops to the floor with a hollow thunk. As successful career women we left work feeling powerful, but the traffic at Kapi'olani and Kalakaua has ended that. We might be the ones chosen to mold our islands' future, but we're stuck like everyone else, our cars moving at the speed of poi.<br><br>We stare into the four-story convention center, its glass walls lending the impression of a squared fishbowl. A dental convention is in town, and we watch as a cluster of attendees crowd the escalator. On the ground floor they shake hands and exchange business cards. One of them reaches into his plastic goody-bag to show off a collection of maps, pamphlets, and lastly some travel toothbrushes, which causes riotous laughter among the group. We are not privy to the joke, but our mouths are sticky from nine hours at the office. We could use those toothbrushes right now.<br><br>We could also use massages and an end to this traffic. Esther Lu could use a glass of wine, which she would sip on the couch when she finally reaches her condo. Laura Tavares would like two hours of television, preferably the Food Channel. The rest of us want a personal chef. Lacking one, we'll probably call our parents and see what they're having for dinner, which we do on more evenings than we'd care to admit. One more benefit of returning home to the islands.<br><br>Despite our tendency toward culinary laziness, our exhaustion is not allowed to overtake us this evening. Tonight, we're celebrating. Laura just submitted her proposal for a LEED-certified resort on Maui, and we hear her firm will win the bid; Kiana Naone was promoted to Politics Editor at the Honolulu Advertiser; and Esther will take the lead on a high-profile murder case that all but promises her making partner in a year. After years of part-time jobs and student loans and late nights with a desk lamp's yellow light on our books, we've made it. Or are making it. Or are close to saying we will make it.<br><br>It doesn't hurt that we're from here. We are considered by our peers to be local women who've done well, left but come back, dedicated their education and mainland skills to putting this island right. We speak at civic club gatherings and native rights events. We are becoming pillars of the island community. We are growing into who we've always dreamt of being. But sometimes, late at night and alone beneath the hand-stitched Hawaiian quilts we can finally afford to purchase, we wish we had followed our law and grad school boyfriends to D.C. or Chicago. We could have foregone being pillars. We could have been regular women.<br><br>Meeting room doors are flung open and dentists stream from the fishbowl. The day's activities at the convention center are ended. The dentists cross the Ala Wai Canal, swarm the bridge on Kalakaua Avenue, and the traffic stands completely still as our cars are consumed by a mass of people armed with travel toothbrushes. Some jackass honks his horn like it's going to move the herd. The dentists all look so similar, with their neatly cut hair, ruler-straight teeth, and habit of striding with purpose, as if their assistance is urgently needed elsewhere. We can't help but wonder which of them are single.<br><br>In this moment of exit, their spirits high from presentations on the latest anesthetic or whitening solution, the dentists forget where they are. Hawai'i has less tropical flavor than they recall from the morning, less exoticism, less beauty. Waikiki has become like any other city strip. We'd like to tell them that Waikiki is nothing more than a succession of Hyatts and Courtyard by Marriotts, Cheesecake Factories and Planet Hollywoods, Senor Frogs and dingy Irish pubs with names like Murphy's and Callahan's. We'd like to tell them the real Hawai'i is elsewhere, hidden in the karaoke bars on King Street and on Waimanalo's ranch lands, in the view of the Mokes from Pillboxes and along the beach by Dillingham Air Strip, the portion of North Shore where only locals camp. We could tell them, but we say nothing.<br><br>Our cars inch forward. We stare out the windows, bored. A woman in a polka-dot bikini and pareo is shopping in one of the ABC convenience stores. Why do women from the Continent think they should shop in their bikinis? She buys two bags of Kona coffee, four boxes of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, a string of cheap Pacific pearls, and a stack of postcards featuring various beaches all bathed in the reddish light of the same sunset. Her brother--same ski-jump nose, same narrowly set eyes--holds up a T-shirt, pointing proudly to the central image: a hula girl wearing a coconut bra, grass skirt, and lei. The hula girl's skin is fair, haole skin, and we're not sure if this makes the image better or worse.<br><br>The light changes. Our cars inch forward again. We return our gaze to the dentists, whose spouses are waiting for them in front of numerous hotel lobbies. The spouses are tired and hungry and pink as boiled shrimp from their day at the beach. The kids--all ages--are bored or playing video games or asking when they can next swim in the hotel pool. We pretend that, if on vacation ourselves, we would act differently--hike Koko Head, attend a bon dance, visit the Palace and learn about the Hawaiian monarchy--but deep down, we know we'd do the same as they: venture no farther than the nearest Starbucks.<br><br>In front of Denny's, one of the kids whines, "I wanted Mickey-ear pancakes," and the mother says to her husband, "Next year, Florida." We want to tell the boy we understand: Hawai'i lacks a Toon Town and roller coasters. And outside of Waikiki, the native dress seems suspiciously similar to what's on sale at Macy's. Hawai'i is no fantasyland.<br>Men fill the Lava Lounge the way sand fills a tidepool: at the edge of the rock walls and then creeping toward the center. A game is on--at the Lava Lounge, a game is always on--and a spontaneous moan issues from the bar. The men's faces tilt upward, in the direction of the big-screen TVs mounted above the top-shelf liquor, and their arms are crossed in such a way that their beer rests in the crooks of their left elbows. They speak to each other out of the corners of their mouths, analyzing plays and players and, maybe once, a woman who crosses their field of vision. They are not immune to us, but they aren't ready to pursue us yet either. In the meantime, we order dinner and describe the waves we caught this morning.</p><h2>Savage Continent: Europe in the Aftermath of World War II</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize </b><br><b></b><br><b>"A superb and immensely important book."&#x2015;Jonathan Yardley, </b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br><b><i></i>The Second World War might have officially ended in May 1945, but in reality it rumbled on for another ten years...</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>The end of World War II in Europe is remembered as a time when cheering crowds filled the streets, but the reality was quite different. Across Europe, landscapes had been ravaged, entire cities razed, and more than thirty million people had been killed in the war. The institutions that we now take for granted&#x2015;such as police, media, transport, and local and national government&#x2015;were either entirely absent or compromised. Crime rates soared, economies collapsed, and whole populations hovered on the brink of starvation.. In <i>Savage Continent</i>, Keith Lowe describes a continent where individual Germans and collaborators were rounded up and summarily executed, where concentration camps were reopened, and violent anti-Semitism was reborn. In some of the monstrous acts of ethnic cleansing the world has ever seen, tens of millions were expelled from their ancestral homelands. <i>Savage Continent</i> is the story of post&#x2013;war Europe, from the close of the war right to the establishment of an uneasy stability at the end of the 1940s. Based principally on primary sources from a dozen countries, <i>Savage Continent</i> is the chronicle of a world gone mad, the standard history of post&#x2013;World War II Europe for years to come.</p></p><p><p><b>Keith Lowe</b> is the author of two novels and the critically acclaimed history <i>Inferno: The Fiery Devastation of Hamburg, 1943</i>. He is widely recognized as an authority on the Second World War, and has often spoken on TV and radio, both in Britain and the United States. Most recently he was an historical consultant and one of the main speakers in the PBS documentary <i>The Bombing of Germany</i> which was also broadcast in Germany. His books have been translated into several languages, and he has also lectured in Britain, Canada and Germany.

What greeted me instead was the lingering stench of ashes and the empty sockets of our ruined home.</i> Samuel Puterman on his return to Warsaw, 19451;2 <br>&nbsp; <i>We could see the physical destruction but the effect of vast economic disruption and political, social, and psychological destruction ... completely escaped us.</i> Dean Acheson, US Under-Secretary of State, 1947 1 Physical Destruction In 1943 the travel book publisher Karl Baedeker produced a guide to the Generalgouvernement -- that part of central and southern Poland that remained nominally separate from the Reich. As with all publications in Germany at the time, it was just as concerned with disseminating propaganda as with giving its readers information. The section on Warsaw was a case in point. The book waxed lyrical about the city's German origins, its German character and the way that it had become one of the world's great capitals 'predominantly through the effort of Germans'. It urged tourists to visit the medieval Royal Castle, the fourteenth-century cathedral and the beautiful late-Renaissance Jesuit Church - all the products of German culture and influence. Of special interest was the complex of late baroque palaces around Pilsudski Square - 'the most beautiful square in Warsaw' - now renamed Adolf Hitler Platz. The centrepiece was the 'Saxon' Palace, built of course by a German, and its beautiful Saxon Gardens, which were again designed by German architects. The travel guide conceded that one or two buildings had unfortunately been damaged by the battle for Warsaw in 1939, but since then, it reassured its readers, Warsaw 'is being rebuilt once more under German leadership'.1 No mention was made of the western suburbs of the city, which had been converted into a ghetto for Jews. This was probably just as well because even as the book was being published an uprising broke out here, obliging SS-Brigadef�hrer J�rgen Stroop to set fire to virtually every house in the district.2 Almost four square kilometres of the city were entirely destroyed in this way. The following year a second uprising broke out throughout the rest of the city. This time it was a more general insurgency inspired by the Polish Home Army. In August 1944, groups of Polish men, women and teenagers began ambushing German soldiers and stealing their weapons and ammunition. For the next two months they barricaded themselves in and around the Old City, and held down more than 17,000 German anti-insurgent troops.3 The uprising only came to an end in October after some of the most brutal fighting of the war. Afterwards, tired of Polish disobedience, and aware that the Russians were about to enter the city anyway, Hitler ordered the city to be completely razed.4 Accordingly, German troops blew up the medieval Royal Castle that had so impressed Baedeker. They undermined the fourteenth-century cathedral and blew that up too. Then they destroyed the Jesuit Church. The Saxon Palace was systematically blown up over the course of three days just after Christmas 1944, as was the entire complex of baroque and rococo palaces. The European Hotel, recommended by Baedeker, was first burned down in October and then, just to make sure, blown up in January 1945. German troops went from house to house, street to street, systematically destroying the entire city: 93 per cent of Warsaw's dwellings were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. To complete the destruction they burned down the National Archive, the Archives of Ancient Documents, the Financial Archives, the Municipal Archives, the Archives of New Documents and the Public Library.5 After the war, when the Poles were turning their thoughts to rebuilding their capital, the National Museum held an exhibition showing fragments of buildings and artworks that had been damaged or destroyed during the German occupation. They produced an accompanying guide book, which, unlike Baedeker's guide book, was written entirely in the past tense. The intention was to remind the people of Warsaw, and the wider world, of exactly what had been lost. There is a realization implicit in both the guide book and the exhibition itself that those who lived through the destruction of Warsaw were no longer able to appreciate the immensity of what had happened to their city. For them it had happened gradually, beginning with the bombardment in 1939, continuing with German looting during the occupation and ending with the destruction of the Ghetto in 1943 and the final devastation in late 1944. Now, just a few months after their liberation, they had become used to living in shells of houses, surrounded on all sides by mountains of rubble.6 In some ways the true scale of the destruction could be appreciated only by those who saw its results without actually witnessing it taking place. John Vachon was a young photographer who came to Warsaw as part of the United Nations relief effort after the war. The letters he wrote to his wife Penny in January 1946 display his complete incomprehension at the scale of the destruction. <br> This is really an incredible city and I want to give you an idea of it, and don't know how I can do it. It's a big city, see. Over one million pre war. Big as Detroit. Now it is 90 per cent <i>all</i> destroyed ... Wherever you walk here it is hunks of buildings standing up without roofs or much sides, and people living in them. Except the Ghetto, where it is just a great plain of bricks, with twisted beds and bath tubs and sofas, pictures in frames, trunks, millions of things sticking out among the bricks. I can't understand how it could have been done ... It's something that's so vicious I can't believe it.7 <br> The beautiful baroque city described by Karl Baedeker just two years earlier had completely disappeared. <br>&nbsp; It is difficult to convey in meaningful terms the scale of the wreckage caused by the Second World War. Warsaw was just one example of a city destroyed - there were dozens more within Poland alone. In Europe as a whole <i>hundreds</i> of cities had been entirely or partially devastated. Photographs taken after the war can give some idea of the scale of the destruction of individual cities, but when one tries to multiply this devastation across the entire continent it necessarily defies comprehension. In some countries - especially Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia and Ukraine - a millennium of culture and architecture had been crushed in the space of just a few short years. The violence that brought about such total devastation has been likened by more than one historian to Armageddon. 8 Those people who witnessed the wreckage of Europe's cities struggled to come to terms even with the local devastation they saw, and it is only in their tortured, inadequate descriptions that some of the destruction becomes imaginable. However, before we come to such human reactions to the crushed and shattered scenery, it is necessary to set down some statistics - because statistics matter, regardless of how elusive they can be. As the only nation to have successfully defied Hitler for the entire duration of the war, Britain had suffered badly. The Luftwaffe had dropped almost 50,000 tons of bombs on Britain during the Blitz, destroying 202,000 houses and damaging 4.5 million more.9 The pounding received by Britain's major cities is well known, but it is what happened to some of the smaller towns that shows the true extent of the bombing. The ferocity of the attacks on Coventry gave birth to a new German verb, <i>coventriren</i> -- to 'Coventrate', or destroy utterly. Clydebank is a relatively small industrial town on the outskirts of Glasgow: out of 12,000 homes only 8 escaped damage.10 Across the English Channel the damage was not quite so universal, but much more concentrated. Caen, for example, was virtually wiped off the map when the Allies landed in Normandy in 1944: 75 per cent of the city was obliterated by Allied bombs.11 Saint-L� and Le Havre suffered even worse, with 77 per cent and 82 per cent of the buildings destroyed.12 When the Allies landed in the south of France more than 14,000 buildings in Marseilles were partly or completely destroyed.13 According to government records for compensation claims and loans for war losses, 460,000 buildings in France were destroyed in the war, and a further 1.9 million damaged.14 The further east one travelled after the war, the worse the devastation became. In Budapest 84 per cent of the buildings were damaged, and 30 per cent of them so badly that they were entirely uninhabitable.15 About 80 per cent of the city of Minsk in Belarus was destroyed: only 19 of 332 major factories in the city survived, and only then because mines set by the retreating Germans were defused by Red Army sappers just in time.16 Most of the public buildings in Kiev were mined when the Soviets retreated in 1941 -- the rest were destroyed when they returned in 1944. Kharkov in eastern Ukraine was fought over so many times that eventually there was little left to dispute. In Rostov and Voronezh, according to one British journalist, 'the destruction was very nearly 100 per cent'.17 And the list goes on. Approximately 1,700 towns and cities were devastated in the USSR, 714 of them in Ukraine alone.18 Those who travelled across this ruined landscape in the aftermath of the war saw city after city after city destroyed. Very few of these people ever attempted to describe the totality of what they had seen - instead they struggled to come to terms with the more localized damage in each single city as they came across it. Stalingrad, for example, was nothing but 'lumps of walls, boxes of half-ruined buildings, piles of rubble, isolated chimneys'.19 Sebastopol 'was now melancholy beyond words' where 'even in the suburbs ... there was hardly a house standing'.20 In September 1945 the American diplomat George F. Kennan found himself in the formerly Finnish but now Russian city of Vyborg, admiring the way that 'Rays of early morning sunshine ... caught the gutted shells of apartment buildings, and flooded them momentarily with a chill, pale gleam.' Apart from a goat that he startled in one of the ruined doorways, Kennan seemed to be the only living being in the entire city.21 At the centre of all this destruction lay Germany, whose cities undoubtedly suffered the most comprehensive damage of the war. Around 3.6 million German apartments were destroyed by the British and American air forces - that is, about a fifth of all living spaces in the country.22 In absolute terms the damage to living spaces in Germany was nearly eighteen times as bad as it was in Britain.23 Individual cities suffered far worse than the average. According to figures from the Reich's Statistical Office, Berlin lost up to 50 per cent of its habitable premises, Hanover 51.6 per cent, Hamburg 53.3 per cent, Duisburg 64 per cent, Dortmund 66 per cent, and Cologne 70 per cent.24 When Allied observers came to Germany after the war, most of them expected to find destruction on the same scale as they had witnessed in Britain during the Blitz. Even after British and American newspapers and magazines began to print pictures and descriptions of the devastation it was impossible to prepare for the sight of the real thing. Austin Robinson, for example, was sent to western Germany directly after the war on behalf of the British Ministry of Production. His description of Mainz while he was there displays his sense of shock: <br> That skeleton, with whole blocks level, huge areas with nothing but walls standing, factories almost completely gutted, was a picture that I know will live with me for life. One had known it intellectually without feeling it emotionally or humanly.25 <br> British Lieutenant Philip Dark was equally appalled by the apocalyptic vision he saw in Hamburg at the end of the war: <br> [W]e swung in towards the centre and started to enter a city devastated beyond all comprehension. It was more than appalling. As far as the eye could see, square mile after square mile of empty shells of buildings with twisted girders scarecrowed in the air, radiators of a flat jutting out from a shaft of a still-standing wall, like a crucified pterodactyl skeleton. Horrible, hideous shapes of chimneys sprouting from the frame of a wall. The whole pervaded by an atmosphere of ageless quiet ... Such impressions are incomprehensible unless seen.26 <br> There is a sense of utter despair in many of the descriptions of German cities in 1945. Dresden, for example, no longer resembled 'Florence on the Elbe' but was more like 'the face of the moon', and planning directors believed that it would take 'at least seventy years' to rebuild.27 Munich was so badly devastated that 'It truly did almost make one think that a Last Judgement was imminent.'28 Berlin was 'completely shattered - just piles of rubble and skeleton houses'.29 Cologne was a city 'recumbent, without beauty, shapeless in the rubble and loneliness of complete physical defeat'.30 Between 18 and 20 million German people were rendered homeless by the destruction of their cities - that is the same as the combined prewar populations of Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg.31 Another 10 million people in Ukraine were also homeless, or more than the total prewar population of Hungary.32 These people lived in cellars, ruins, holes in the ground - anywhere they could find a modicum of shelter. They were entirely deprived of essential services, such as water, gas, electricity - as were millions of others across Europe. Warsaw, for example, had just two working street lights.33 In Odessa water was only available from artesian wells, so that even visiting dignitaries were given just a single bottle per day for washing.34 Without these essential utilities the populations of Europe's cities were reduced to living, as one American columnist described it, 'in medieval fashion surrounded by the broken-down machinery of the twentieth century'.35 <br>&nbsp; While the devastation was at its most dramatic in Europe's cities, rural communities often suffered just as badly. Across the continent farms were plundered, burned, flooded or simply neglected because of the war. The marshes in southern Italy, so assiduously drained by Mussolini, were deliberately flooded again by the retreating Germans, causing a resurgence of malaria.36 More than half a million acres of Holland (219,000 hectares) were ruined when German troops deliberately opened the dykes that kept the sea at bay.37 Remoteness from the main theatres of war was no protection from such treatment. More than a third of the dwelling places in Lapland were destroyed by the retreating Germans.38 The idea was to deny the turncoat Finnish forces any shelter during the winter, but it also had the effect of creating over 80,000 refugees. Across northern Norway and Finland roads were mined, telephone lines pulled down and bridges blown up, creating problems that would be felt for years after the war was over. Once again, the further east, the worse the destruction. Greece lost a third of its forests during the German occupation, and over a thousand villages were burned and left uninhabited.39 In Yugoslavia, according to the postwar Reparations Commission, 24 per cent of the orchards were destroyed, as were 38 per cent of the vineyards and about 60 per cent of all livestock. The plundering of millions of tons of grain, milk and wool completed the ruination of the Yugoslav rural economy.40 In the USSR it was even worse: here as many as 70,000 villages were destroyed, along with their communities and the entire rural infrastructure.41 Such damage was not merely the result of fighting and casual plundering - it was caused by the systematic and deliberate destruction of land and proper...</p><h2>Run Fast.

A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time.

Some idiot had just played three versions of the same song. If another one flipped, he was going to knock a few heads and then take off.<br><br>His brother was now&#x2014;he checked his watch&#x2014;ten minutes late. The way Dylan figured, it would serve Jamie right if he bailed. He hadn't wanted to meet at the bar in the first place, and he certainly wasn't in any mood to sit here by himself listening to a bad version of a song he'd never liked much in the first place.<br><br>On this, the evening of Black Friday, the Liz was hopping. A popular local band was supposed to be playing, but from the buzz he'd heard around the bar, apparently the bass player and the lead singer&#x2014;married to each other&#x2014;had shared a bad Thanksgiving tofurkey the day before and were too busy yakking it up to entertain the masses.<br><br>Those masses were now growing restless. He no longer liked crowds under the best of circumstances, and a bar filled with holiday-edgy, disappointed music fans with liberal access to alcohol struck him as an unpleasant combination.<br><br>Somebody jostled him from behind and he could tell without turning around it was a woman. The curves pressing into his shoulder were a good giveaway, along with a delectable scent of cinnamon and vanilla that made him think of crisp, rich cookies.<br><br>His mouth watered. He'd been a hell of a long time without ..cookies.<br><br>"Pat, where's my mojito? Come <em>on.</em> I've been waiting <em>forever?"</em><br><br>The woman with the husky voice squeezed past him to lean against the bar, and from the side, he caught only an equally sexy sleek fall of blond hair. She was wearing a white sweater that was about half an inch too short, and when she leaned over, just a strip of pale skin showed above the waistline of a pair of jeans that highlighted a shapely ass.<br><br>The longtime Lizard bartender frowned, his wind-chapped face wrinkling around the mouth. "It's coming. I'm shorthanded. Stupid me, I figured when the band canceled, nobody would show up. Give me a sec. Have some pretzels or something."<br><br>"I don't <em>want</em> pretzels. I want another mojito."<br><br>She had obviously already had a mojito or three, judging by the careful precision of her words. The peremptory tone struck a chord. He looked closer and suddenly recognized the alluring handful: Genevieve Beaumont, spoiled and precious daughter of the Hope's Crossing mayor.<br><br>She was quite a bit younger than he was, maybe six years or so. He didn't know her well, only by reputation, which wasn't great. He had always figured her for a prissy little society belle&#x2014;the kind of vapid, boring woman who wasted her life on a solemn quest for the perfect manicure.<br><br>She didn't look it now. Instead, she looked a little tousled, slightly buzzed and oddly delicious.<br><br>"If somebody plays another damn Christmas carol, I swear, I am going to <em>scream.</em> This is a freaking bar, not Sunday school."<br><br>"Hear, hear," he murmured, unable to hold back his wholehearted agreement.<br><br>She finally deigned to pay attention to anything but herself. She shifted her gaze and in her heavily lashed blue eyes he saw a quick, familiar reaction&#x2014;a mangle of pity and something akin to fascinated repugnance.<br><br>Yeah, he hated crowds.<br><br>To her credit, she quickly hid her response and instead offered a stiff smile. "Dylan Caine. I didn't see you there."<br><br>He gave her a polite smile in return. Completely out of unwarranted malevolence, he lifted what remained of his left arm in a caricature of a wave. "Most of me, anyway."<br><br>She swallowed and blinked but didn't lose that stiff smile. If anything, it seemed to beam unnaturally, like a blinking string of Christmas lights. "Er, nice to see you again," she said.<br><br>He couldn't remember ever having a conversation with the woman in his life. If he had, he certainly would have recalled that husky voice that thrummed through him, as rich and heady as his Johnnie Walker.<br><br>"Same," he said, which wasn't completely a lie. He did enjoy that little strip of bare skin and a pair of tight jeans.<br><br>"Are you visiting your family for the holidays?" she asked, polite conversation apparently drilled into her along with proper posture and perfect accessory coordination, even when she was slightly drunk.<br><br>"Nope." He took a sip of his whiskey. "I moved back in the spring. I've got a place up Snowflake Canyon."<br><br>"Oh. I hadn't heard." She focused on a point somewhere just above his right ear, though he noticed her gaze flicking briefly, almost against her will, to the eye patch that concealed a web of scar tissue before she jerked it away.<br><br>He fought the urge to check his watch again&#x2014;or, to hell with Jamie, toss a bill on the bar for his tab and take off.<br><br>Though they certainly weren't society-conscious people like the Beaumonts, Dermot and Margaret Caine had drilled proper manners in him, too. Every once in a while he even used them. "Don't think I've seen you around town since I've been back. Where are you living these days?"<br><br>Her mouth tightened, and he noticed her lipstick had smeared ever so slightly on her lower lip. "Until three days ago, I was living in a beautiful fifth-floor flat in Le Marais in Paris."<br><br><em>Ooh la la.</em> Le Marais. Like that was supposed to mean anything to him.<br><br>"Somebody should really do something about that music," she complained to Pat before Dylan could answer. "Why would you put so many freaking versions of the same song on the jukebox?"<br><br>The bartender looked frazzled as he pulled another beer from the tap. "I <em>had</em> to spring for that stupid digital jukebox. Worst business decision of my life. It's completely ruined the place. It's like karaoke every night. Here's a little secret you might not know. We have a crapload of people in Hope's Crossing with lousy taste in music."<br><br>"You could always take it out," Dylan suggested.<br><br>"Believe me, I'm tempted every night. But I paid a fortune for the thing. Usually I just end up forking over some of my tips and picking my own damn songs."<br><br>He finally set a pink mojito in front of Genevieve. She picked it up and took a healthy sip.<br><br>"Thank you," she said, her sexy voice incongruously prim, then gave Dylan that polite, empty smile. "Excuse me."<br><br>He watched her head in the direction of the gleaming jukebox, wondering what sort of music she would pick. Probably something artsy and annoying. It better not be anything with an accordion.<br><br>He checked his watch, which he really hated wearing on his right arm after a lifetime of it on the left. Jamie was now fifteen minutes late. That was about his limit.<br><br>Just as he was reaching into his pocket for his wallet, his phone buzzed with an incoming text.<br><br>As he expected, it was from Jamie, crisp and succinct:<br><br>Sorry. Got held up. On my way. Stay there!<br><br>His just-older brother knew him well. Jamie must have guessed that after all these months of solitude, the jostling crowd and discordant voices at The Speckled Lizard would be driving him crazy.<br><br>He typed a quick response with one thumb&#x2014;a pain in the ass but not as bad as finger-pecking an email.<br><br>You've got five.<br><br>He meant it. If Jamie wasn't here by then, his brother could drive up to Snowflake Canyon to share a beer for his last night in town before returning to his base.<br><br>The digital jukebox Pat hated switched to "Jingle Bell Rock," a song he disliked even more than "The Little Drummer Boy."<br><br>"Sorry," the bartender said as he passed by on his way to hand a couple of fruity-looking drinks to a tourist pair a few stools down.<br><br>Dylan glanced over at the flashing lights of the jukebox just in time to see Genevieve Beaumont head in that direction, mojito in hand.<br><br>Uh-oh.<br><br>More intrigued by a woman than he had been in a long time, he watched as she said something impassioned to the professionally dressed couple who seemed to be hogging all the music choices.<br><br>He couldn't hear what she said over the loud conversation and clinking glasses wrapping around him, but he almost laughed at her dramatic, agitated gestures. So much for the prissy, buttoned-up debutante. Her arms flung wide as she pointed at the jukebox and then back at the couple. From a little impromptu lipreading, he caught the words <em>bar, idiot</em> and <em>Christmas carols.</em><br><br>The female half of the couple&#x2014;a pretty redhead wearing a steel-gray power suit and double strand of olive-sized pearls&#x2014;didn't seem as amused as Dylan by Genevieve's freely given opinion. She said something in response that seemed as sharp as her shoes, judging by Genevieve's quick intake of breath.<br><br>The woman brandished a credit card as if it was an AK-47 and hurried toward the digital piece of crap, probably to put in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir singing "Away in a Manger" or something else equally inappropriate for the setting.<br><br>Dylan chuckled when, after a quick, startled second, the mayor's genteel daughter rushed forward like a Broncos tackle, her drink spilling a little as she darted ahead, her body blocking the woman from accessing the jukebox.<br><br>"Move your bony ass," he heard the woman say, quite unfairly, in the personal opinion of a man who had just had ample evidence that particular piece of Ms. Beaumont wasn't anything of the sort.<br><br>"Make me," Gen snarled.<br><br>At that line-in-the-sand declaration, Dylan did a quick ninety-degree swivel on his barstool to watch the unfolding action and he realized he wasn't the only one. The little altercation was beginning to draw the interest of other patrons in the bar.<br><br>Nothing like a good girl fight to get the guys' attention.<br><br>"I have the right to listen to whatever I want," Madame Power Suit declared.<br><br>"Nobody else wants to listen to Christmas music.<br><br>Am I right?"<br><br>A few nearby patrons offered vocal agreement and the color rose in the redhead's cheeks. "I do," she declared defiantly.<br><br>"Next time, bring your iPod and earbuds," Gene-vieve snapped.<br><br>"Next time be the first one to the jukebox and you can pick the music," the woman retorted, trying to sneak past Genevieve.<br><br>She shoved at Genevieve but couldn't budge her, again to Dylan's amusement&#x2014;until the man who had been sitting with the carol-lover approached. He wore a dress shirt and loosened tie but no jacket and was a few years older than his companion. While he carried an air of authority, he also struck Dylan as similar to the bullies in the military who had no trouble pushing their weight around to get their way.<br><br>"Come on. That's enough, girls. What's the harm in a few Christmas carols? It's the day after Thanksgiving, after all."<br><br>"I believe this is between me and your girlfriend."<br><br>"She's not my girlfriend. She's my associate."<br><br>"I don't care if she's Mrs. Santa Claus. She has lousy taste in music and everybody in the place has had enough."<br><br>The other woman tried again to charge past Gen-evieve with her credit card but Genevieve blocked access with her own body.<br><br>"Do you have any idea who you're messing with?" He advanced on her, his very bulk making him threatening.<br><br>"Don't know, don't care."<br><br>He loomed over her, but Genevieve didn't back down. She was just full of surprises. On face value, he wouldn't have taken her for anybody with an ounce of pluck.<br><br>"She happens to be an assistant district attorney. We both are." Oh, crap.<br><br>Genevieve apparently meant it when she said she didn't care. "I hate attorneys. My ex-fiance was an attorney," she snapped.<br><br>The guy smirked. "What's his name? I'd like to call the man and buy him a drink for being smart enough to drop-kick a psycho like you."<br><br>Genevieve seemed to deflate a little, looking for a moment lost and uncertain, before she bristled. <em>"I</em> drop-kicked <em>him,</em> for your information, and I haven't missed him for a minute. In my experience, most attorneys will do anything necessary to get their way."<br><br>"Damn straight," the woman said. She planted her spiked heel on Genevieve's foot hard and when the effort achieved its desired result&#x2014;Genevieve shrieked in surprise and started to stumble&#x2014;the woman tried to dart around her. But the former head cheerleader of Hope's Crossing High School still apparently had a few moves. She jostled with the woman and managed to slap away her hand still gripping the credit card before she could swipe it.<br><br>"That's assault!" the woman declared. "You saw that, didn't you, Larry? The stupid bitch just hit me."<br><br>"That wasn't a hit. That was a slap. Anyway, you started it."<br><br>"True story." A helpful bystander backed her up.<br><br>The woman turned even more red in the face.<br><br>"Okay, this is ridiculous. Let her pass. Now." Larry the Jerk reached for Genevieve's arm to yank her away from the jukebox. At the sight of that big hand on her white sweater, Dylan rose, his barstool squeaking as he shoved it back.<br><br>"Sit down, Caine," Pat urged, a pleading note in his voice. Dylan ignored him, adrenaline pumping through him like pure scotch whiskey. He didn't necessarily like Genevieve Beaumont, but he hated bullies more.<br><br>And she did have a nice ass.<br><br>"You're going to want to back down now," he said, in his hardest former-army-ranger voice.<br><br>The guy didn't release Genevieve's arm as he looked Dylan up and down, black eye patch and all. "Aye, matey. Or what? You'll sic your parrot on me?"<br><br>Dylan was vaguely aware of an audible hiss around him from locals who knew him.<br><br>"Something like that," he answered calmly.<br><br>He reached out and even with only one hand he was able to deftly extricate Genevieve's arm from the man's hold and twist his fingers back.<br><br>"Thank you," she answered in surprise, straightening her sweater.<br><br>"You're welcome." He released the man's hand. "I suggest we all go back to our drinks now."<br><br>"I'm calling the police," the woman blustered. "You're crazy. Both of you."<br><br>"Oh, shut up," Genevieve snapped.<br><br>"You shut up. You're both going to face assault charges."<br><br>"I might not be a lawyer but I'm pretty sure that wasn't assault," Genevieve responded sharply. "This is."<br><br>Dylan hissed in a breath when Genevieve drew back a fist and smacked the woman dead center in her face.<br><br>Blood immediately spurted from the woman's nose, and she jerked her hands up, shrieking. "I think you just broke my nose!"<br><br>The contact of flesh on flesh seemed to shock Genevieve back to some semblance of sobriety. She blinked at the pair of them. "Wow. I had no idea I could do that. I guess all those years of Pilates weren't completely wasted."<br><br>The words were barely out of her mouth when the woman dropped her hands from her nose and lunged at her, and suddenly the two of them were seriously going at it, kicking, punching, pulling hair.<br><br>Why did they always have to pull hair?<br><br>Dylan, with only one arm and skewed vision, was at a disadvantage as he reached into the squirming, tangled pair of women to try breaking things up. Larry, without a similar limitation, reached in from the other side but the women jostled into him and he stumbled backward, crashing into a big, tough-looking dude who fell to the floor and came up swinging.<br><br>Everybody's nerves were apparently on edge tonight, what with dysfunctional family dinners, early-morning shopping misery, puking-sick musicians. Before he knew it, the guy's friends had entered i...</p><h2>Stanley Donwood: There Will Be No Quiet</h2><p><b>The prolific talent behind Radiohead&#x2019;s iconic artwork reveals the creative process that has driven a career spanning more than 20 years&nbsp;</b><br><br> Widely regarded as one of the most important graphic artists of his generation, Stanley Donwood is the man behind Radiohead&#x2019;s signature, yet ever-evolving, visual aesthetic.

An update and expansion of the original 1984, 2000, and 2007 IPT manuals, this guide illustrates not only individual IPT treatment for patients with major depression but also adaptations of IPT for different diagnoses, patient populations, and treatment formats. This book is the basis for the extensive research that has validated IPT and led to its listing in treatment guidelines.<br><br>Written by the originators of the treatment and one of its leading researchers, this updated and expanded guide describes how to approach clinical encounters with patients, how to focus IPT treatment, and how to handle therapeutic difficulties. IPT can be combined with medication, and it is a safe alternative to medication for individuals who may not be able to take antidepressants. IPT has been shown not only to relieve symptoms but to build social skills as well. Learn how to use IPT to effectively treat depression and other disorders including bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress, and borderline personality disorder. With clinical examples and sample therapist scripts throughout, <em>The Guide</em> summarizes the theoretical and empirical background of IPT and focuses on teaching you the best way to deliver this effective, immensely practical treatment.<br></p><p><br><strong>Myrna M.

She received her PhD in Epidemiology from Yale University School of Medicine where she also became a professor. Early on in her career she began working with Gerald Klerman at Yale University on the development of IPT. Together they carried out this work, testing IPT in several clinical trials of maintenance and acute treatment of depression and modification for primary care they called Interpersonal Counseling. They published the first IPT manual in 1984.<br><br><strong>John C. Markowitz, MD, </strong>received his medical degree from Columbia University and did his residency training in psychiatry at the Payne Whitney Clinic of Cornell Medical Center, where he was trained in interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) by the late Gerald L. Klerman. First at Cornell and then at Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute, Dr. Markowitz has conducted comparative studies of IPT, other psychotherapies, and medications, studying mood, anxiety, and personality disorders. He has received numerous grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and other organizations, has published several hundred articles and book chapters, and has taught and supervised IPT around the world.<br><br><strong>Gerald L.

He was convinced that interpersonal relationships importantly influenced the course and recurrence of illness, and that psychotherapy could potentially stabilize interpersonal relations. Gerry was the force behind the original ideas in the first Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) manual (Klerman et al., 1984) and many of its adaptations. Gerry died young in April 1992. Even years after his death, his writing on IPT is pervasive. Gerry held numerous prestigious positions in psychiatry and government. He graduated from New York University Medical School and did his residency at Harvard. He was professor at Yale University, Harvard Medical School, and lastly, Weill Medical College of Cornell University. He was appointed by President Carter to lead the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, a position he held between 1977 and 1980.<br></p><h2>The Last Apprentice: Curse of the Bane (Book 2) (Last Apprentice, 2)</h2><p><p>The Spook and his apprentice, Thomas Ward, rid the county of witches, ghosts, boggarts, and other creatures of the dark. And there's some unfinished business to attend to in Priestown. Deep in the catacombs lurks a creature the Spook has never been able to defeat; a force so evil that the whole county is in danger. The Bane!</p><p>But the Bane is not their only enemy. The Quisitor arrives, intent on hunting down anyone who meddles with the dark. Thomas Ward and the Spook must prepare for the battle of their lives.</p></p><p><p>Joseph DELANEY is the author of the internationally best-selling The Last Apprentice series, which is now a major motion picture, <em>Seventh Son</em>. He is a former English teacher who lives in the heart of boggart territory in Lancashire, England. His village has a boggart called the Hall Knocker, which was laid to rest under the step of a house near the church.</p>Christopher Evan Welch does his best with an uneven and gory tale of exorcism. As young Thomas Ward and his mentor, the Spook, battle the Bane beneath a cathedral in Priestown, they must also struggle with the high church official who is bent on eradicating all who practice the dark arts. Welch is a bit too good at his portrayal of the Quisitor's sadistic glee at burning people alive and torturing confessions out of them. Welch clearly delivers Ward's insecurity and growing knowledge and bravery. His portrayal of Alice, the young witch who aids Ward, is equally good. However, there is an unevenness to his early voicings of the Spook, and the Bane's delivery is less menacing than it purports to be.

Originally West Virginians told these hundred stories not for idle amusement but to report supernatural experiences that defied ordinary human explanation. From jealous rivals and ghostly children to murdered kinsmen and omens of death, these tales reflect the inner lives&#x2015;the hopes, beliefs, and fears&#x2015;of a people. Like all folklore, these tales reveal much of the history of the region: its isolation and violence, the passions and bloodshed of the Civil War era, the hardships of miners and railroad laborers, and the lingering vitality of Old World traditions.</p><p><b>Ruth Ann Musick</b>, professor emeritus of English at Fairmont State College, West Virginia, is the author of <i>The Telltale Lilac Bush</i>."The variety of subjects in her book is vast. Half the enjoyment comes from searching through the pages, discovering one new ghost after another. It's all good hunting and good haunting."&#x2015;<i>Rocky Mountain News</i></p><h2>The Prince: Introduction by Dominic Baker-Smith (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics Series)</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That Machiavelli&#x2019;s name has become synonymous with cold-eyed political calculation only heightens the intrinsic fascination of <i>The Prince</i>&#x2013;the world&#x2019;s preeminent how-to manual on the art of getting and keeping power, and one of the literary landmarks of the Italian Renaissance. Written in a vigorous, straightforward style that reflects its author&#x2019;s realism, this treatise on states, statecraft, and the ideal ruler is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand how human society actually works.</p></p><p>When Lorenzo de' Medici seized control of the Florentine Republic in 1512, he summarily fired the Secretary to the Second Chancery of the Signoria and set in motion a fundamental change in the way we think about politics. The person who held the aforementioned office with the tongue-twisting title was none other than Niccol� Machiavelli, who, suddenly finding himself out of a job after 14 years of patriotic service, followed the career trajectory of many modern politicians into punditry. Unable to become an on-air political analyst for a television network, he only wrote a book. But what a book <i>The Prince</i> is. Its essential contribution to modern political thought lies in Machiavelli's assertion of the then revolutionary idea that theological and moral imperatives have no place in the political arena. "It must be understood," Machiavelli avers, "that a prince ... cannot observe all of those virtues for which men are reputed good, because it is often necessary to act against mercy, against faith, against humanity, against frankness, against religion, in order to preserve the state." With just a little imagination, readers can discern parallels between a 16th-century principality and a 20th-century presidency. <i>--Tim Hogan</i>Here is the world's most famous master plan for seizing and holding power. Astonishing in its candor <i>The Prince</i> even today remains a disturbingly realistic and prophetic work on what it takes to be a prince . . . a king . . . a president. When, in 1512, Machiavelli was removed from his post in his beloved Florence, he resolved to set down a treatise on leadership that was practical, not idealistic. In <i>The Prince</i> he envisioned would be unencumbered by ordinary ethical and moral values; his prince would be man and beast, fox and lion. Today, this small sixteenth-century masterpiece has become essential reading for every student of government, and is the ultimate book on power politics.</p><h2>Night Pleasures (Dark-Hunter, Book 2)</h2><p><p>Dear Reader,</p><p>Have you ever wanted to know what it's like to be immortal?

Loyal to his friends and passionately in love with the one woman who was denied him, Richard emerges as a gifted man far more sinned against than sinning.</p><p>This magnificent retelling of his life is ?lled with all of the sights and sounds of battle, the customs and lore of the ?fteenth century, the rigors of court politics, and the passions and prejudices of royalty.</p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a publisher I have been lucky to be able to visit bookstores all over the country, independent and chain alike. What interests me first about these stores is what titles are being displayed in the 'Staff Recommends' section of the store. It is here that you can find treasured, beloved books quite dear to someone who works in the stores, someone waiting quite eagerly for the chance to hand sell their recommended titles.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in these Staff Recommend sections that I kept on seeing our Penman's titles, HERE BE DRAGONS, FALLS THE SHADOW, THE RECKONING and also SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR and WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT.<br>It's funny, you can sell something for years before you notice that the author has been quietly making a powerful impact on people everywhere.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started with HERE BE DRAGONS and I have never looked back. Her trilogy of the decline of the Welsh kings ( DRAGON, FALLS THE SHADOW and THE RECKONING)is a holiday gift I give year after year, and I'm happy to say they have always been embraced and loved. From my 15 year old niece to my 70 year old mother and many ages in between, all readers are enchanted and transported to a land and an age gone forever. But Penman makes them live forever in our minds and hearts with fantastic, unforgettable characters and wonderful history. HERE BE DRAGONS is such a great title--medieval mapmakes would write those words across any part of the map that was unknown.. a wonderful metaphor for how little the Welsh and English knew of each other.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR--Warning: This is not Shakespeare's Richard III. In this novel, Richard is a victim of circumstance and man vilified by the Tudors, but here presented as a decent and normal man, a man of conscience.<br>AND he is not a murderer. Yes, those princes did die, but not by Richard's hand.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEN CHRIST AND HIS SAINTS SLEPT<p>Another wonderful title, for it refers to the 15 years of England's darkest time-the civil war between the cousins Queen Maud and King Steven. England was deserted, for Christ and his saints were sleeping. I had never even heard of these royals. Queen Maud was the legitimate heir to the throne, but a woman, and there fore not fit to rule. She is also the mother of Henry, who later married Eleanor of Aquitaine . Pretty heady stuff, more incredible men and women, another book to get totally lost in. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it has been years since all these books were first published, I can name 5 stores I have been in in the past 3 months that have one of these titles in the Staff Recommends section.<br><br>-Alice Kesterson, Ballantine Regional Sales Manger</p>ader is left with the haunting sensation that perhaps the good a man does can live after him--especially in the hands of a dedicated historian."<br>SAN DIEGO UNION<br>In this stirring historical novel, Sharon Kay Penman redeems Richard III from his villainous role in history as the hulking, evil hunchback. This dazzling recreation of his life is filled with the sights and sounds of battle, and the passions of the highborn. Most of all, it brings to life a gifted man whose greatest sin was that he held principles too firmly for the times in which he lived, and loved too deeply to survive love's loss.</p><h2>The Story of Easter: An Easter And Springtime Book For Kids (Trophy Picture Books (Paperback))</h2><p>With an informative text and glorious illustrations, this book explains both how and why people all over the world celebrate Easter. It tells the biblical story of Jesus&#x2019; Resurrection and then describes how people honor this day and the origins of these traditions. Hands-on activities help draw children into the spirit of this joyous celebration of rebirth.<br> <p></p></p><p>Aileen Fisher's informative, well-organized text describes Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, then moves on to explain the origins of other springtime rituals and their connection to the biblical traditions. Basic facts about the history of Easter, Passover, the Easter Bunny, Easter eggs, and other forms of religious and secular symbolism are lucidly conveyed, without going into excessive detail. The emphasis is on the symbolism of new life and new hope in the hearts of people, whether in Christian celebrations or in spring festivals. As Fisher says, "Not all Christian churches celebrate the Easter season in the same way. But the message of Easter is always the same. It is the joy and celebration of the belief that God's love is stronger than death." The author includes instructions on decorating Easter eggs, as well as a recipe for the traditional Easter-morning treat, hot cross buns. First published in 1968, this gorgeous new edition is illustrated by Stefano Vitale, who decorates each page as carefully and exquisitely as if it were a precious Easter egg. Lush yet muted earth tones and a folk-art slant to the paintings set this apart as a truly special Easter book.

Nevertheless, whether he is describing the sleepless nights of his childhood, the ticking of clocks "always ... too subtle a sound, getting absorbed in the oak of the floorboards and the fabric of the tapestries," or appraising the forbidding character of his grandfather, the "Curator Earl," Spencer casts a candid, evocative light on his subject.<p> Indeed, Spencer's own efforts on the estate have been considerable. First comes the business of repairing the predations of his "short-termist stepmother," Raine, the countess of Dartmouth, who has laid down wall-to-wall oatmeal carpet in a 115-foot-long Tudor picture gallery. Now comes the death and burial on the estate of his sister, Diana, the princess of Wales. That Charles must now curate the family home as a site of global mourning is a trial quite the equal of anything the estate has ever faced.</p><p> Subtitled "The Story of an English House," the book has a structure, dividing the subject into buildings, grounds, family history, and collections, that is entirely conventional. Yet Spencer surprises by packing in many details about the social and political vicissitudes that shaped his family's wealth and taste. In doing so, he eschews his grandfather's regrettable elitism, while losing none of the old man's dedication to the family's heritage. Like all good introductions, this book suggests a world and time far exceeding its little compass. <i>--Simon Ings</i></p>Charles, Viscount Althorp, became the ninth Earl Spencer on the death of his father in 1992. Since then he has undertaken extensive refurbishment of Althorp and supervised the changes made to accommodate the many thousands of people who wish to visit the home and grounds since the death of his sister. He was educated at Eton College and obtained his degree in Modern History at Magdalen College, Oxford.</p><h2>Modern Parents, Vintage Values: Instilling Character in Today&#x2019;s Kids</h2><p><p>What do I do when my son learns phrases in school that he's not allowed to say at home?<br><br>How do I teach my daughter caution but not fear?<br><br>How do I teach my daughter about gratitude when she believes she is entitled to a cell phone and a laptop and everything else that not only she wants, but that all of the kids around her already have?<br><br>Melissa Trevathan and Sissy Goff hear these types of questions and many other comments from parents on a daily basis in their counseling office and at ministry events. Today, more than ever before, we live in a culture that is at war against our parenting. Between the internet, the media, the sense of entitlement that kids are living with, the disrespect . . . it is almost too much. We often wish we could move back to Mayberry, where our biggest concern was who had set off the firecrackers in the neighbor's garage. While those aren't the issues most parents are facing today, Melissa and Sissy believe we can still raise children who value, well, values. They provide a clear and possible path back to cultivating children who have a sense of character and groundedness, who may not be as rampant across playgrounds and parks as they once were. They paint the picture of how to raise children with manners and kindness and with a healthy sense of fear and respect both for their world and the adults around them--and to do so without totally disengaging from the realities of today's world. In short,&nbsp;they believe it is still possible to instill vintage values in modern kids.<br><br><i>Modern Parents, Vintage Values</i> talks about the specific issues facing kids today, helping parents to more fully understand the challenges being faced. Yet Melissa and Sissy don't stop there. They focus in on nine values that are foundational for the character development of children: kindness, integrity, manners, compassion, forgiveness, responsibility, gratitude, patience and confidence. Each chapter is broken down into a section for children and adolescents, and specific ways to foster the specific value for the particular age. <i>Modern Parents, Vintage Values</i> offers parents timeless truths that can break through the chaos of today's culture and instill these truly vintage and important values in kids.</p></p><p><b>Melissa Trevathan, M.R.E.</b> first became a youth director at the age of 16.

There are no bodies, and no such plane has ever been reported missing, but men both good and evil have been seeking it for a long, long time. <br><br>What the wreckage conceals is more important than money. It is power: a list of names, a record of those who have struck a deal with the devil. Now a battle is about to commence between those who want the list to remain secret and those for whom it represents a crucial weapon in the struggle against the forces of darkness. <br><br>The race to secure the prize draws in private detective Charlie Parker, a man who knows more than most about the nature of the terrible evil that seeks to impose itself on the world, and who fears that his own name may be on the list. It lures others, too: a beautiful, scarred woman with a taste for killing; a silent child who remembers his own death; and a serial killer known as the Collector, who sees in the list new lambs for his slaughter. But as the rival forces descend upon this northern state, the woods prepare to meet them, for the forest depths hide other secrets. <br><br><b>Someone has survived the crash. <i>Something </i>has survived the crash.</b> <br><br>And it is waiting. . . .</p><p>John Connolly is the author of the Charlie Parker series of mystery novels, the supernatural collection <i>Nocturnes,</i> the Samuel Johnson Trilogy for younger readers, and (with Jennifer Ridyard) the Chronicles of the Invaders series.

The old man&#x2019;s long gray hair was splayed against the pillow on which he lay, glazed by the lamplight, so that it seemed like the emanations of his departing spirit. His breathing was shallow; longer and longer were the pauses between each intake and exhalation, and soon they would cease entirely. The evening gloaming was slowly descending, but the trees were still visible through the bedroom window, the sentinels of the Great North Woods, for old Harlan had always said that he lived at the very edge of the frontier, that his home was the last place before the forest held sway.<br> <br>It seemed to him now that, as his strength failed him, so too his power to keep nature at bay was ebbing. There were weeds in his yard, and brambles among his rosebushes. The grass was patchy and unkempt; it needed one final mow before the coming of winter, just as the stubble on his own chin rasped uncomfortably against his fingers, for the girl could not shave him as well as he had once shaved himself. Fallen leaves lay uncollected like the flakes of dry skin that peeled from his hands and his face, scattering themselves upon his sheets. He saw decline through his window, and decline in his mirror, but in only one was there the promise of rebirth.<br> <br>The girl claimed that she had enough to do without worrying about bushes and trees, and the boy was still too angry to perform even this simple service for his dying father, but to Harlan these things were important. There was a battle to be fought, an ongoing war against nature&#x2019;s attritional impulse. If everyone thought as his daughter did, houses would be overrun by root and ivy, and towns would vanish beneath seas of brown and green. A man had only to open his eyes in this county to see the ruins of old dwellings suffocated in green, or open his ears to hear the names of settlements that no longer existed, lost somewhere in the depths of the forest.<br> <br>So nature needed to be held back, and the trees had to be kept to their domain.<br> <br>The trees, and what dwelled among them.<br> <br>Harlan was not a particularly religious man, and had always poured scorn on those whom he termed &#x201c;God-botherers&#x201d;&#x2014;Christian, Jew, or Muslim, he had no time for any of them&#x2014;but he was, in his way, a deeply spiritual being, worshipping a god whose name was whispered by leaves and praised in birdsong. He had been a warden with the Maine Forest Service for forty years, and even after his retirement his knowledge and expertise had often been sought by his successors, for few knew these woods as well as he. It was Harlan who had found twelve-year-old Barney Shore after the boy&#x2019;s father collapsed while hunting, his heart exploding so quickly in his chest that he was dead within seconds of hitting the ground. The boy, in shock and unused to the woods, had wandered north, and when the snow began to descend he had hidden himself beneath a fallen tree, and would surely have died there had Harlan not been following his tracks, so that the boy heard the old man calling his name just as the snow covered the traces of his passing.<br> <br>It was to Harlan, and to Harlan alone, that Barney Shore told the tale of the girl in the woods, a girl with sunken eyes, and wearing a black dress, who had come to him with the first touch of snow, inviting him to follow her deeper into the woods, calling on him to play with her in the northern darkness.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I hid from her, and I didn&#x2019;t go with her,&#x201d; Barney told Harlan, as the old man carried him south upon his back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not, son?&#x201d; said Harlan.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because she wasn&#x2019;t a little girl, not really. She just looked like one. I think she was very old. I think she&#x2019;d been there for a long, long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>And Harlan had nodded and said, &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; for he had heard tales of the lost girl in the woods, although he had never seen her himself, unless bad dreams counted, and he prayed to his god of air and tree and leaf that he might be spared the sight of her. There was a time, though, when he had felt her presence, and he had known as he was searching for the boy that he was once again drawing close to her territory.<br> <br>He shuddered and thought carefully before he spoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I were you, son, I wouldn&#x2019;t mention the girl to anyone else,&#x201d; he said at last, and he felt the boy nod against him.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They wouldn&#x2019;t believe me anyway, would they?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. I reckon they&#x2019;d think you were suffering from shock and exposure, and they&#x2019;d put it down to that, most of them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you believe me, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh yes, I believe you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She was real, wasn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s the word I&#x2019;d use for her. I don&#x2019;t reckon that you could touch her or smell her or feel her breath upon your face. I don&#x2019;t know that you could see her footprints indented in the snow, or discern the stain of sap and leaf upon her skin. But if you&#x2019;d followed her like she asked I&#x2019;d never have found you, and I&#x2019;m certain that nobody else would ever have found you either, alive or dead. You did well to keep away from her. You&#x2019;re a good boy, a brave boy. Your daddy would be proud.&#x201d;<br> <br>Against his back began the convulsions of the boy&#x2019;s sobs. It was the first time he had cried since Harlan discovered him. Good, thought Harlan. The longer it takes for the tears to come, the worse the pain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you find my daddy too?&#x201d; said the boy. &#x201c;Will you bring him home? I don&#x2019;t want him to stay in the woods. I don&#x2019;t want the girl to have him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Harlan. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find him, and you can say goodbye to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>And he did.<br> <br>Harlan was already in his seventies by then, and had a few more years left in him, but he was no longer the man he once had been, even though he, and he alone, had found Barney Shore. Age was part of it, that was for sure, but so too were the losses he had endured. His wife, Angeline, had been taken from him by a cruel alliance of Parkinson&#x2019;s and Alzheimer&#x2019;s one year before Barney Shore spoke to him of predatory girls. He had loved her as much as a man can love his wife, and so nothing more need be said.<br> <br>The loss of his wife was the second such blow that Harlan would receive in less than a year. Shortly after she passed away, Paul Scollay, Harlan&#x2019;s oldest and closest friend, had sat on a bucket in the little woodshed at the back of his cabin, put his shotgun in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. The cancer had been nibbling at him for a while, and now had got a taste for him. He put an end to its feeding, as he had always told his friend that he would. They had shared a drink earlier in the day&#x2014;just a beer or two at the pine table beside that very woodshed with the sun setting behind the trees, as beautiful an evening as Harlan had seen in many a year. They had reminisced some, and Paul had seemed relaxed and at peace with himself, which was how Harlan had known that the end was near. He did not remark upon it, though. They had simply shaken hands and Harlan had said that he would see Paul around, and Paul had replied, &#x201c;Ayuh. I guess so,&#x201d; and that was the end of it.<br> <br>And though they spoke of many things in those final hours, there was one subject upon which they did not touch, one memory that was not disinterred. They had agreed years before that they would not talk of it unless absolutely necessary, but it hung between them in the last of their time together as the sun bathed them in its radiance, like the promise of forgiveness from a god in whom neither of them believed.<br> <br>And so it was that at the time of his dying, at the day and the hour of it, Harlan Vetters summoned his son and his daughter to his bedside, the woods waiting beyond, the god of tree and leaf moving through them, coming at last to claim the old man, and he said to them:<br> <br>&#x201c;Once upon a time, Paul Scollay and I found an airplane in the Great North Woods.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;&#x201d;</p><h2>The Illustrated Face of Battle: A Study of Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme</h2><p>A thorough assessment of three famous battles conveys the reality of war for the participants through descriptive text, paintings, prints, engravings, battle plans, and photographs</p><p>With the same text as the original British classic, published in 1976, this now includes 32 color photographs and 80 black-and-white illustrations.

And so, in 1791, he wrote to Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, who had signed the Declaration of Independence.

This is the story of Benjamin Banneker--his science, his politics, his morals, and his extraordinary correspondence with Thomas Jefferson.<br></p><p><b>Andrea Davis Pinkney</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of several books for young readers, including the novel <i>Bird in a Box</i>, a Today Show Al Roker Book Club for Kids pick, and <i>Hand in Hand: Ten Black Men Who Changed America, </i>winner of the Coretta Scott King Author Award.

Andrea Davis Pinkney lives in New York City.Grade 1-3-This look at the life and times of the 18th-century black scientist is accompanied by Brian Pinkney's full-page masterful and luminous scratchboard/ oil paintings. Andrea Pinkney provides a basic outline of her subject's youth and years as a tobacco farmer, his passion for learning and interest in astronomy, and his decision to write an almanac. She focuses the account on an exchange of letters in 1791, when Banneker sent a copy of his newly printed almanac to Thomas Jefferson, then U.S. Secretary of State, and chastised him for keeping slaves. The reply sounds like a polite brush-off, and Jefferson made no acknowledgement of the dichotomy between his Declaration of Independence and his ownership of slaves. The quoting of these letters in the prose of the time forces the inclusion of vocabulary and syntax several levels above that of the audience for which the book seems intended. Although the bare-bones details are here, he does not come alive; while the art is lovely, the text offers just a glimpse at this remarkable man's accomplishments. The author states that the publishing of Banneker's almanac "showed everybody that indeed all men are created equal." Since the almanac reached a limited audience, one wonders how many people at the time even knew who Banneker was, or about his ethnic background. Although the book is more accessible to younger readers than Jeri Ferris's What Are You Figuring Now? (Carolrhoda, 1988), it may not hold their attention.<br><i>Martha Rosen, Edgewood School, Scarsdale, NY</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Catwings</h2><p>Four young cats with wings leave the city slums in search of a safe place to live, finally meeting two children with kind hands.</p><p>Ursula Le Guin writes both poetry and prose, and in various modes including children&#39;s books, YA books, fantasy, science fiction and fiction.

Then she realizes that they will be able to fly away from their dreary and dangerous city neighborhood. (Mrs. T. can't come with them because she is going to marry Mr. Tom Jones, and ``I don't want you children underfoot!'') So the kittens sadly leave their mother and go off into the world. After some mild adventures, they settle in a wooded area and learn to forage for themselves. Then danger appears in the form of a large owl. Luckily at this point Harriet, the smallest kitten, discovers Susan and Hank Brown from a neighboring farm. The tale ends happily with the cats snuggled up to the children and the promise of a safe new home. Cats are always appealing, and winged cats should be doubly so. However, the story barely skirts cuteness; the language has a self-conscious tone which works against the action of the plot. Softly-colored ink drawings add an old-fashioned tone, as do the Victorian names of the cats. Ruth S. Vose, San Francisco Pub .

In which case it may have been invented on the Spanish islands of Hispaniola or Cuba (where it would have been called aguadiente, or &#x201c;burning water&#x201d;), or by Portuguese colonists on the coast of Brazil (where it would later be called cacha�a). Or possibly it was first distilled by the French on one of their Caribbean island strongholds (where the poorer grades of rum were known as tafia). On the other hand, it may have been first concocted in the 1400s somewhere in Europe by secretive alchemists searching for the elixir of life and feeding through their retorts whatever fermentable matter they could get their hands on. Or just maybe it was invented even earlier by an anonymous chemist tinkering near the cane fields of coastal India.<br><br> The thing is, no one really knows when rum first appeared. If you want to know about the history of sugar, overflowing archives provide enough information to lead to mental obesity. But for rum, it&#x2019;s a starvation diet. The West Indian island of Barbados has long claimed that first Barbadians invented rum, and it&#x2019;s telling that no historians have roused themselves to seriously dispute this point. Some, like rum expert Edward Hamilton, have argued that rum was first produced commercially in the Portuguese or Spanish colonies, probably in Brazil, and he has been rooting around for customs documents or ship manifests to back this up. He hasn&#x2019;t found anything yet. (And he guesses he may never: Rum exports from the colonies were prohibited by Spain and Portugal, which meant any rum produced was smuggled and undocumented. And even if it had been documented, the ports of the West Indies were laid waste by attackers with numbing regularity, so the archives of the earliest days are often nonexistent.)<br><br> This much at least is known about rum: Sometime around the middle of the seventeenth century, an outbreak of rum occurred almost everywhere the Dutch, Spanish, French, and English were engaged in their New World errand-running. The British sea captain John Josselyn wrote of a dinner held on a ship off the coast of present-day Maine in September 1639, at which another captain toasted him with a pint of rum. Laws controlling the sale of rum abruptly cropped up in different colonies, as a warden in pursuit of a persistent truant&#x2014;in Bermuda in 1653, in Connecticut in 1654, in Massachusetts in 1657.<br><br> Then, sometime shortly before 1650, rum surfaced at an extravagant feast held at the Barbados estate of James Drax, the most important planter on Great Britain&#x2019;s most important island colony. For anyone curious about the cultural history of rum&#x2014;or who wants to learn about the ancestry of that bottle of West Indian rum in the back of their liquor cabinet&#x2014;I&#x2019;d argue that this is as fine a place to begin the story as any.<br><br> P<br><br> Barbados is pear-shaped and just twenty-one miles long by fourteen miles wide&#x2014;or about one-seventh the size of Rhode Island. On a map of the Caribbean, Barbados lies far to the east, like a wayward child refusing to stand in line with the rest of the Lesser Antilles, which sweep in a great arc from Puerto Rico to Trinidad. Adventurers from Portugal and Spain landed here in the sixteenth century, but finding no precious metals to mine nor Indians to enslave, they lingered only long enough to name the island &#x201c;Los Barbados,&#x201d; after the &#x201c;bearded&#x201d; fig trees. Barbados lay unmolested until 1625, when a British sailing ship stopped off while heading home from Brazil. The captain claimed the island for the British throne and reported on its pleasing qualities to Sir William Courteen, the ship&#x2019;s owner. Courteen hastened to cobble together a syndicate, then dispatched a ship with supplies to support several dozen colonists. On February 20, 1627, eighty colonists&#x2014;plus ten slaves captured along the way&#x2014;disembarked near present-day Holetown on the island&#x2019;s west coast.<br><br> The mandate given the first settlers by Courteen was not complicated: Go forth and produce. Specifically, produce for export such things as were in demand in England. The colonists tried growing cotton, indigo, and fustic wood, the latter a sort of tropical mulberry useful in making yellow dye. These crops did not produce great fortunes. Taking a cue from the colony at Virginia, which had been settled two decades earlier, the islanders planted tobacco, which was then the most profitable agricultural staple in the colonies. But a glut in London soon undercut prices, and Barbados tobacco was hampered by another problem: It was &#x201c;so earthy and worthless,&#x201d; wrote one seventeenth-century island visitor, that it provided &#x201c;little or no return from England.&#x201d; A 1628 shipment was described as &#x201c;foul, full of stalks, and evil colored.&#x201d; Even the islanders wouldn&#x2019;t smoke it.<br><br> And then came sugar.<br><br> The species Saccharum officinarum (&#x201c;sugar of the apothecaries&#x201d;), a freakishly tall and sharp-edged grass, had first appeared around 4000 b.c. in Asia, most likely in Papua New Guinea, where primitive agriculturists had selected the sweetest canes for further breeding. These plants migrated eastward with traders, to India and on to the Mediterranean. In 325 b.c. a general under Alexander the Great came upon sugarcane for the first time and described it with wonder as a plant that &#x201c;brings forth honey without the help of bees.&#x201d;<br><br> Sugar soon became an essential crop in the colonial Atlantic islands off Africa, including Madeira, the Canary Islands, and the Azores. It made the leap to the New World with Christopher Columbus, whose father-in-law was a Madeira sugar planter. On the explorer&#x2019;s second trip across the Atlantic in 1493, he brought live sugarcane seedlings and oversaw their planting on Hispaniola. The sugar grew fabulously, and colonists were quick to establish plantations over the next two decades in Mexico, Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. The Portuguese, demonstrating a flair for running complex businesses in difficult environments far from home, planted cane aggressively on the damp Brazilian coast and brought in sugar presses and copper boiling vats from home. The number of sugar refineries in Brazil grew from 5 in 1550 to 350 less than a century later. With great quantities of sugar now being produced in the New World, the price fell, and many of the sugar producers of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic islands were ruined. The New World sugar era was dawning.<br><br> Barbados made the most of it. In England, the demand for sugar soared as it quickly evolved from a luxury for aristocrats to a staple for the masses. It was in great demand for making sweets, masking the taste of rancid meat, and sweetening new beverages, including coffee (which arrived in Britain in 1650), chocolate (1657), and tea (1660). Between 1660 and 1700, the per capita consumption of sugar in England quadrupled, and then it doubled again in the next quarter century. The value of sugar shipped to England and Wales was worth twice that of tobacco by the end of the seventeenth century.<br><br> With reports filtering home of great fortunes being made, thousands of British colonists boarded ships for the West Indies. The well-off paid for their outbound trips and brought enough cash to acquire some acreage and build a sugar works or two. Those unable to afford the �6 trip traded passage and board by signing on as indentured servants, typically committing to seven years of labor on a plantation, after which they would be freed and given a small parcel of land. A third group washed ashore on the islands: thieves and petty criminals, who were exiled from England to the West Indies much as later undesirables would be shipped off to Australia. Slaves from Africa, too, were beginning to arrive in great numbers against their will, imported by the sugar planters to work the expanding fields. The population of Barbados swelled from just 80 in 1627 to more than 75,000 by 1650.<br><br> James Drax&#x2014;later Sir James Drax&#x2014;arrived on Barbados in 1627 among the first wave of settlers. He began by planting tobacco, then switched to sugarcane. He quickly amassed an estate of 850 acres, which yielded a torrent of cash. Drax was the first to build island windmills, which were expensive but more efficient and productive than cattle-powered mills. His wealth grew, and he had plenty of company. &#x201c;It is seldom seen that the ingenious or the industrious fail of raising their fortunes in any part of the Indies,&#x201d; wrote one planter to an acquaintance in England. Another noted in 1655 that Barbados was &#x201c;one of the richest spots of ground in the world,&#x201d; adding that the gentry there &#x201c;live far better than ours do in England.&#x201d;<br><br> In England, architects had been flirting with a hybrid style for British manor houses, mixing elements of Gothic and classic. The results were often eye-catching, although not always in a good way. The planters commissioned dozens of similarly grand homes of coral stone smoothed with plaster. Drax&#x2019;s great house was three stories and featured a carved mastic archway near a grand staircase, the whole pile capped with angular gables and studded with corner finials. Such homes were notably ill-suited for the tropical weather, and many were, oddly, built with fireplaces. One visitor marveled that the planters, who spent afternoons indoors drinking spirits and smoking pipes, did not spontaneously combust.<br><br> Just as the houses were ill-designed for the stifling heat, so, too, were colonial island fashions. Merchant ships laden with current London styles would arrive with jackets and gowns unsuitable for the oppressive tropics. Yet the fashionable were undaunted. &#x201c;One may see men loaded and half melting under a ponderous coat and waistcoat,&#x201d; noted an early visitor to Jamaica, another thriving British colony, &#x201c;richly bedaubed with gold lace or embroidery on a hot day, scarcely able to bear them.&#x201d;<br><br> Through happy circumstance, these planters inhabited one of those rare junctures of time and place when money seemingly tumbled out of the sky. Sugar was king, the source of instant fortunes, taking on the role that railroads, oil, and the Internet would later play in North America. In the mid-seventeenth century, Barbados was the wealthiest colony in the budding British empire, as well as its most populous. The free white men of the islands had a net worth several times that of even the most industrious colonists on the North American mainland. Barbados produced more sugar and employed more shippers than all the other British West Indian islands put together. The island&#x2019;s moment was to last for decades; as late as 1715, the value of exports from Barbados exceeded not only that of the other islands, but of all the other British North American colonies (island and mainland) combined. The city of Bridgetown in the seventeenth century was bigger and more prosperous than Manhattan.<br><br> The wealth that flowed back to England was immense. A writer in 1708 likened Barbados to a massive gold or silver mine being excavated for the benefit of the homeland and claimed that trade with the island supported sixty thousand people in England. The other British islands, like St. Christopher, Nevis, Jamaica, and Antigua, also contributed to the fortunes flowing back across the Atlantic, and the planters and their agents saw little that couldn&#x2019;t be improved with gilding. In one well-known encounter, King George III and his prime minister were riding near Weymouth, England, when they were all but forced off the road by an extravagant carriage accompanied by a great many outriders in flamboyant clothing. The king was informed that the procession was that of a sugar planter from Jamaica. &#x201c;Sugar, sugar, hey? All that sugar!&#x201d; said the king. &#x201c;How are the duties, hey, Pitt, how are the duties?&#x201d;<br><br> One of those attracted to Barbados was Richard Ligon, who arrived under circumstances not wholly of his own choosing. A British royalist who had lost his business during the convulsions of the English rebellion, Ligon set off for the island in June 1647 with five acquaintances. The group acquired and managed a sugar estate, and Ligon remained on the island until 1650. His account is not only the chief source of information about early island life, but an enchanting chronicle, in large part because Ligon never lost his capacity to marvel in the face of great hardships. Barbados was in the throes of a yellow fever epidemic when he arrived, with the disease (by one accounting) killing six thousand inhabitants. Ligon, who nearly died of the fever three times himself, wrote that &#x201c;the living were hardly able to bury the dead.&#x201d;<br><br> Yet Ligon was endlessly enthusiastic about the island&#x2019;s charms, including the incomparable taste of pineapple juice (&#x201c;certainly the Nectar which the Gods drunk&#x201d;) and the succulence of the feral pigs descended from swine abandoned by early Portuguese mariners (&#x201c;the sweetest flesh . . . and the loveliest to look on in a dish, either boyl&#x2019;d, roasted, or bak&#x2019;d&#x201d;). Given his persistent good cheer, it&#x2019;s all the more striking that Ligon wrote A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbadoes (1657) while confined to an English debtor&#x2019;s prison, into which he was tossed upon his return from the West Indies. (Ligon&#x2019;s experience shows that not every colonist came home burdened with fortune.)<br><br> Historian Lowell Ragatz has written that new arrivals on the island were often astounded by the &#x201c;gastronomic feats&#x201d; performed at plantation feasts. &#x201c;In violation of all rules of dietetics, huge quantities of heavy food and drink were disposed of,&#x201d; Ragatz wrote.<br><br> Indeed, Drax hosted one such feast, where the offerings might have intimidated Falstaff. Ligon was there, and he reported that it began with a first course of fourteen beef dishes, featuring a cow especially fattened in a private pasture of abundant forage. Its breast, rump, and cheeks were variously roasted, boiled, and baked. The legs and head went into a spiced stew, and the tongue and tripe were made into a meat pie seasoned with currants and finely minced sweet herbs.<br><br> Then came the second course. It included a leg of pork and boiled chicken and shoulder of mutton and a young goat, its belly filled with a pudding. There was veal loin dressed with oranges, lemons, and limes, and a suckling pig served in a sauce of claret, sage, nutmeg, and brains. (The pig was &#x201c;the fattest, whitest, and sweetest in the world,&#x201d; Ligon wrote.) Then came three turkeys and two capons and two hens (served with their own eggs) and four ducklings and three rabbits and eight turtledoves and, for good measure, Spanish bacon. And oysters and caviar and olives and a potato pudding and a piquant relish made of fish eggs.</p><h2>NIV Study Bible, 10th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>- Features the New International Version--the most popular, trusted and accurate modern Bible translation - Icons highlight important information - NIV Concordance - Over 20,000 In-Text Study Notes written specifically for The NIV Study Bible by NIV translators - Over 2.8 million copies sold - Words of Christ in red letter - Center-Column Cross-Referencing System with over 100,000 references--exclusive to the NIV.

We know that he was born in England, the son of a master butcher. We know that he trained as a gardener and was employed on a number of private estates before retiring. We shall probably never know exactly how and why he came so obsessively and so brilliantly to photograph the plants he encountered in everyday life at the turn of the century. Yet Charles Jones did not photograph his vegetables, fruits, and flowers within nature. On the contrary, he isolated his works against neutral backgrounds - beguiling studio &#34;portraits&#34; of beans and onions, squashes and turnips, tulips and sunflowers, plums and pears. His techniques - close-up viewpoint, long exposure, and spare composition - anticipate by decades the later achievements of modernist masters, for here was an &#34;outsider&#34; genius, who was saved from obscurity only by the photographic collector Sean Sexton&#39;s chance discovery of his surviving prints in a London market. The photographs themselves are Jones&#39; only statement. He left no notes, diaries, or writings to explain his reasons for the creation of such a prodigious and concentrated body of work, superbly reproduced in this volume. Revealing art in nature, Jones&#39; images have a wider significance in he history of both photography and still-life, brilliantly explored and explained here by renowned expert Robert Flynn Johnson.</p><p></p><h2>101 Amazing Things to Do in Portugal: Portugal Travel Guide</h2><p><p><b>Congratulations!

I grew up with my younger sister, Lucille, under the care of my grandmother, Mrs. Sylvia Foster, and when she died, of her sisters-in-law, Misses Lily and Nona Foster, and when they fled, of her daughter, Mrs. Sylvia Fisher. Through all these generations of elders we lived in one house, my grandmother&#x2019;s house, built for her by her husband, Edmund Foster, an employee of the railroad, who escaped this world years before I entered it. It was he who put us down in this unlikely place. He had grown up in the Middle West, in a house dug out of the ground, with windows just at earth level and just at eye level, so that from without, the house was a mere mound, no more a human stronghold than a grave, and from within, the perfect horizontality of the world in that place foreshortened the view so severely that the horizon seemed to circumscribe the sod house and nothing more. So my grandfather began to read what he could find of travel literature, journals of expeditions to the mountains of Africa, to the Alps, the Andes, the Himalayas, the Rockies. He bought a box of colors and copied a magazine lithograph of a Japanese painting of Fujiyama. He painted many more mountains, none of them identifiable, if any of them were real. They were all suave cones or mounds, single or in heaps or clusters, green, brown, or white, depending on the season, but always snowcapped, these caps being pink, white, or gold, depending on the time of day. In one large painting he had put a bell-shaped mountain in the very foreground and covered it with meticulously painted trees, each of which stood out at right angles to the ground, where it grew exactly as the nap stands out on folded plush. Every tree bore bright fruit, and showy birds nested in the boughs, and every fruit and bird was plumb with the warp in the earth. Oversized beasts, spotted and striped, could be seen running unimpeded up the right side and un-hastened down the left. Whether the genius of this painting was ignorance or fancy I never could decide.<br>One spring my grandfather quit his subterraneous house, walked to the railroad, and took a train west. He told the ticket agent that he wanted to go to the mountains, and the man arranged to have him put off here, which may not have been a malign joke, or a joke at all, since there are mountains, uncountable mountains, and where there are not mountains there are hills. The terrain on which the town itself is built is relatively level, having once belonged to the lake. It seems there was a time when the dimensions of things modified themselves, leaving a number of puzzling margins, as between the mountains as they must have been and the mountains as they are now, or between the lake as it once was and the lake as it is now. Sometimes in the spring the old lake will return. One will open a cellar door to wading boots floating tallowy soles up and planks and buckets bumping at the threshold, the stairway gone from sight after the second step. The earth will brim, the soil will become mud and then silty water, and the grass will stand in chill water to its tips. Our house was at the edge of town on a little hill, so we rarely had more than a black pool in our cellar, with a few skeletal insects skidding around on it. A narrow pond would form in the orchard, water clear as air covering grass and black leaves and fallen branches, all around it black leaves and drenched grass and fallen branches, and on it, slight as an image in an eye, sky, clouds, trees, our hovering faces and our cold hands.<br>My grandfather had a job with the railroad by the time he reached his stop. It seems he was befriended by a conductor of more than ordinary influence. The job was not an especially good one. He was a watchman, or perhaps a signalman. At any rate, he went to work at nightfall and walked around until dawn, carrying a lamp. But he was a dutiful and industrious worker, and bound to rise. In no more than a decade he was supervising the loading and unloading of livestock and freight, and in another six years he was assistant to the stationmaster. He held this post for two years, when, as he was returning from some business in Spokane, his mortal and professional careers ended in a spectacular derailment.<br>Though it was reported in newspapers as far away as Denver and St. Paul, it was not, strictly speaking, spectacular, because no one saw it happen. The disaster took place midway through a moonless night. The train, which was black and sleek and elegant, and was called the Fireball, had pulled more than halfway across the bridge when the engine nosed over toward the lake and then the rest of the train slid after it into the water like a weasel sliding off a rock. A porter and a waiter who were standing at the railing at the rear of the caboose discussing personal matters (they were distantly related) survived, but they were not really witnesses in any sense, for the equally sound reasons that the darkness was impenetrable to any eye and that they had been standing at the end of the train looking back.<br>People came down to the water&#x2019;s edge, carrying lamps. Most of them stood on the shore, where in time they built a fire. But some of the taller boys and younger men walked out on the railroad bridge with ropes and lanterns. Two or three covered themselves with black grease and tied themselves up in rope harnesses, and the others lowered them down into the water at the place where the porter and the waiter thought the train must have disappeared. After two minutes timed on a stopwatch, the ropes were pulled in again and the divers walked stiff-legged up the pilings, were freed from their ropes and wrapped in blankets. The water was perilously cold.<br>Till it was dawn the divers swung down from the bridge and walked, or were dragged, up again. A suitcase, a seat cushion, and a lettuce were all they retrieved. Some of the divers remembered pushing past debris as they swam down into the water, but the debris must have sunk again, or drifted away in the dark. By the time they stopped hoping to find passengers, there was nothing else to be saved, no relics but three, and one of them perishable. They began to speculate that this was not after all the place where the train left the bridge. There were questions about how the train would move through the water. Would it sink like a stone despite its speed, or slide like an eel despite its weight? If it did leave the tracks here, perhaps it came to rest a hundred feet ahead. Or again it might have rolled or slid when it struck bottom, since the bridge pilings were set in the crest of a chain of flooded hills, which on one side formed the wall of a broad valley (there was another chain of hills twenty miles north, some of them islands) and on the other side fell away in cliffs. Apparently these hills were the bank of still another lake, and were made of some brittle stone which had been mined by the water and fallen sheerly away. If the train had gone over on the south side (the testimony of the porter and the waiter was that it had, but by this time they were credited very little) and had slid or rolled once or twice, it might have fallen again, farther and much longer.<br>After a while some of the younger boys came out on the bridge and began to jump off, at first cautiously and then almost exuberantly, with whoops of fear. When the sun rose, clouds soaked up the light like a stain. It became colder. The sun rose higher, and the sky grew bright as tin. The surface of the lake was very still. As the boys&#x2019; feet struck the water, there was a slight sound of rupture. Fragments of transparent ice wobbled on the waves they made and, when the water was calm again, knitted themselves up like bits of a reflection. One of the boys swam out forty feet from the bridge and then down to the old lake, feeling his way down the wall, down the blind, breathless stone, headfirst, and then pushing out from the foot. But the thought of where he was suddenly terrified him, and he leaped toward the air, brushing something with his leg as he did. He reached down and put his hand on a perfectly smooth surface, parallel to the bottom, but, he thought, seven or eight feet above it. A window. The train had landed on its side. He could not reach it a second time. The water bore him up. He said only that smooth surface, of all the things he touched, was not overgrown or hovered about by a cloud of something loose, like silt. This boy was an ingenious liar, a lonely boy with a boundless desire to ingratiate himself. His story was neither believed nor disbelieved.<br>By the time he had swum back to the bridge and was pulled up and had told the men there where he had been, the water was becoming dull and opaque, like cooling wax. Shivers flew when a swimmer surfaced, and the membrane of ice that formed where the ice was torn looked new, glassy, and black. All the swimmers came in. By evening the lake there had sealed itself over.<br>This catastrophe left three new widows in Fingerbone: my grandmother, and the wives of two elderly brothers who owned a dry-goods store. These two old women had lived in Fingerbone thirty years or more, but they left, one to live with a married daughter in North Dakota and the other to find any friends or kin in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, which she had left as a bride. They said they could no longer live by the lake. They said the wind smelled of it, and they could taste it in the drinking water, and they could not abide the smell, the taste, or the sight of it. They did not wait for the memorial service and rearing of the commemorative stone, when scores of mourners and sightseers, led by three officers of the railroad, walked out on the bridge between handrails mounted for the occasion, and dropped wreaths on the ice.<br>It is true that one is always aware of the lake in Fingerbone, or the deeps of the lake, the lightless, airless waters below. When the ground is plowed in the spring, cut and laid open, what exhales from the furrows but that same, sharp, watery smell. The wind is watery, and all the pumps and creeks and ditches smell of water unalloyed by any other element. At the foundation is the old lake, which is smothered and nameless and altogether black. Then there is Fingerbone, the lake of charts and photographs, which is permeated by sunlight and sustains green life and innumerable fish, and in which one can look down in the shadow of a dock and see stony, earthy bottom, more or less as one sees dry ground. And above that, the lake that rises in the spring and turns the grass dark and coarse as reeds. And above that the water suspended in sunlight, sharp as the breath of an animal, which brims inside this circle of mountains.<br>It seems that my grandmother did not consider leaving. She had lived her whole life in Fingerbone. And though she never spoke of it, and no doubt seldom thought of it, she was a religious woman. That is to say that she conceived of life as a road down which one traveled, an easy enough road through a broad country, and that one&#x2019;s destination was there from the very beginning, a measured distance away, standing in the ordinary light like some plain house where one went in and was greeted by respectable people and was shown to a room where everything one had ever lost or put aside was gathered together, waiting. She accepted the idea that at some time she and my grandfather would meet and take up their lives again, without the worry of money, in a milder climate. She hoped that he would somehow have acquired a little more stability and common sense. With him this had so far not been an effect of age, and she distrusted the idea of transfiguration. The bitter thing about his death, since she had a house and a pension and the children were almost grown, was that it seemed to her a kind of defection, not altogether unanticipated. How many times had she waked in the morning to find him gone? And sometimes for whole days he would walk around singing to himself in a thin voice, and speak to her and his children as a very civil man would speak to strangers. And now he had vanished finally. When they were reunited, she hoped he would be changed, substantially changed, but she did not set her heart on it. Musing thus, she set out upon her widowhood, and became altogether as good a widow as she had been a wife.<br>After their father&#x2019;s death, the girls hovered around her, watched everything she did, followed her through the house, got in her way. Molly was sixteen that winter; Helen, my mother, was fifteen; and Sylvie was thirteen. When their mother sat down with her mending, they would settle themselves around her on the floor, trying to be comfortable, with their heads propped against her knees or her chair, restless as young children. They would pull fringe off the rug, pleat her hem, pummel one another sometimes, while they talked indolently about school or worked out the endless minor complaints and accusations that arose among them. After a while they would turn on the radio and start brushing Sylvie&#x2019;s hair, which was light brown and heavy and hung down to her waist. The older girls were expert at building it into pompadours with ringlets at ear and nape. Sylvie crossed her legs at the ankles and read magazines. When she got sleepy she would go off to her room and take a nap, and come down to supper with her gorgeous hair rumpled and awry. Nothing could induce vanity in her.<br>When suppertime came, they would follow their mother into the kitchen, set the table, lift the lids off the pans. And then they would sit around the table and eat together, Molly and Helen fastidious, Sylvie with milk on her lip. Even then, in the bright kitchen with white curtains screening out the dark, their mother felt them leaning toward her, looking at her face and her hands.<br>Never since they were small children had they clustered about her so, and never since then had she been so aware of the smell of their hair, their softness, breathiness, abruptness. It filled her with a strange elation, the same pleasure she had felt when any one of them, as a sucking child, had fastened her eyes on her face and reached for her other breast, her hair, her lips, hungry to touch, eager to be filled for a while and sleep.<br>She had always known a thousand ways to circle them all around with what must have seemed like grace. She knew a thousand songs. Her bread was tender and her jelly was tart, and on rainy days she made cookies and applesauce. In the summer she kept roses in a vase on the piano, huge, pungent roses, and when the blooms ripened and the petals fell, she put them in a tall Chinese jar, with cloves and thyme and sticks of cinnamon. Her children slept on starched sheets under layers of quilts, and in the morning her curtains filled with light the way sails fill with wind. Of course they pressed her and touched her as if she had just returned after an absence. Not because they were afraid she would vanish as their father had done, but because his sudden vanishing had made them aware of her.<br>When she had been married a little while, she concluded that love was half a longing of a kind that possession did nothing to mitigate. Once, while they were still childless, Edmund had found a pocket watch on the shore. The case and the crystal were undamaged, but the works were nearly consumed by rust. He opened the watch and emptied it, and where the face had been he fitted a circle of paper on which he had painted two seahorses. He gave it to her as a pendant, with a chain through it, but she hardly ever wore it because the chain was too short to allow her to look at the seahorses comfortably. She worried that it would be damaged on her belt or in her pocket. For perhaps a week she carried the watch wherever she went, even across the room, and it was not because Edmund had made it for her, or because the painting was less vivid and awkward than ...</p><h2>The Knitter&#39;s Companion (The Companion Series)</h2><p>Providing an overview of gauges, joins, seams, borders, and buttonholes, this portable reference is the definitive tool for hand-knitters and an indispensable addition to any knitter&#x2019;s bag of tricks.<br></p><p>Vicki Square has taught knitting for more than ten years, as well as painting and drawing at Colorado State University."Small enough to stow in your bag, [this] compact spiral-bound guide offers on-the-spot answers to all of your stitching questions." -- <i><i>Family Circle&#x2019;s Easy Knitting</i></i><br><br>"The best of the latest crop...has the basics on casting on, casting off, seaming and things...you need to know." -- <i><i>The News &amp; Observer</i></i></p><h2>Smart Fat: Eat More Fat.

In <i>The Jerusalem Scrolls</i>, the fourth book in the Zion Legacy series, the husband-and-wife team surprise readers with a new spin, creating a story within a story and swapping time periods. It's 1948 when the tale opens, and flames are engulfing the Jewish Quarter. The battle for Old City Jerusalem is lost. Moshe Sachar and Alfie Halder escape the chaos through a secret passageway that leads to a cavernous, subterranean library, where the most sacred Jewish texts lie safely hidden. As Moshe prepares for their long confinement, he finds a tightly rolled papyrus scroll inscribed with the names Miryam and Marcus. He reads, and the scene shifts to the first century A.D., where a love story unfolds. Faithful fans of the series may have to stretch a bit to make the transition from following characters they've come appreciate to enjoying this diversion to a biblical epic. But the Thoenes have the skill to pull it off. Their ability to craft a historical novel and their careful attention to detail and description have resulted in sales of 6 million copies of their books in print, and eight Gold Medallion awards. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i><b>Bodie</b> and <b>Brock Thoene</b>, with degrees in creative writing and history, respectively, are the authors of <b>Jerusalem Vigil</b> and <b>Thunder from Jerusalem</b>, the first two volumes of the <b>Zion Legacy</b> series.

For two decades or more in the humanities, various political arguments have been put forward against beauty: that it distracts us from more important issues; that it is the handmaiden of privilege; and that it masks political interests. In <i>On Beauty and Being Just</i> Elaine Scarry not only defends beauty from the political arguments against it but also argues that beauty does indeed press us toward a greater concern for justice. Taking inspiration from writers and thinkers as diverse as Homer, Plato, Marcel Proust, Simone Weil, and Iris Murdoch as well as her own experiences, Scarry offers up an elegant, passionate manifesto for the revival of beauty in our intellectual work as well as our homes, museums, and classrooms.</p><br><p> Scarry argues that our responses to beauty are perceptual events of profound significance for the individual and for society. Presenting us with a rare and exceptional opportunity to witness fairness, beauty assists us in our attention to justice. The beautiful object renders fairness, an abstract concept, concrete by making it directly available to our sensory perceptions. With its direct appeal to the senses, beauty stops us, transfixes us, fills us with a "surfeit of aliveness." In so doing, it takes the individual away from the center of his or her self-preoccupation and thus prompts a distribution of attention outward toward others and, ultimately, she contends, toward ethical fairness.</p><br><p> Scarry, author of the landmark <i>The Body in Pain</i> and one of our bravest and most creative thinkers, offers us here philosophical critique written with clarity and conviction as well as a passionate plea that we change the way we think about beauty.</p></p><p><p>"With exemplary clarity, Elaine Scarry argues that admiring the beautiful is nothing to be ashamed of; that on the contrary beauty fosters the spirit of justice. A brave and timely book."<b>--J.M.Coetzee</b></p><p>"Here is a writer almost magically summoning up the world through words and ideas, in a new way, and so guiding the reader, lovingly, to receive the treasures and accept the pleasures of this book as naturally as breathing. Here is a book so measured in words and yet so exciting in ideas, a book that explains the world, even as it is explaining itself. This writer, Elaine Scarry, always leading us to consider justice, has given us a book that is beautiful and inspiring to such a degree that after truly reading it, the reader cannot help but be changed."<b>--Jamaica Kincaid</b></p><p>"Among a restorer's solvents, imagine one so marvelous that what it repaired, what it returned to sparkling freshness, was not some beautiful object, but our damaged perception of Beauty itself. Elaine Scarry's imagination works just this wonder: potent enough to dissolve our every grimy resentment, yet so delicate that in Beauty's renewed radiance we discern, long invisible, the subtle outline of an ethics."<b>--D.

If you&#39;re walking in the woods, you can tell that winter is changing into spring by the riot of sound that fills the air. The quacking, piping, and creaking that you hear are the sounds of frogs singing their love songs. Follow those sounds and they may lead you to a vernal pool. A vernal pool is a special pond that&#39;s just right for frogs, salamanders, and other animals. The ecology of the pool is special, too. That&#39;s what makes it frog heaven. With fascinating facts and stunning photographs, Doug Wechsler takes young readers to a vernal pool in a forest to show how wood frogs, tree frogs, salamanders, and other creatures survive and thrive in this Society of School Librarians International Honor Book.</p><p><p><b>Doug Wechsler</b>&nbsp;is a wildlife photographer, ornithologist, and director of VIREO (Visual Resources for Ornithology) at The Academy of Natural Sciences. He lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>*Starred Review* This handsome book looks closely at a vernal pool: a forest pool that dries up at the end of each summer and gradually fills with water again during the fall, winter, and spring. Naturalist-photographer Wechsler offers a close-up view of a vernal pool in Delaware as it cycles through a year. Focusing on one animal after another, he shows not only the variety of life supported by the pool but also the complex, interconnected ecosystem that depends not just on the pool but upon the fact that it dries up annually. This cycle limits the animals the pool can support and creates an environment where certain species thrive, unthreatened by fish or by the year-round presence of certain other predators. Each of the first four chapters considers a season and the changes it brings to the pool and inhabitants, while the final chapter discusses the preservation of vernal pools. From a close-up of salamanders in their jelly-covered eggs to a composite picture with superimposed lines showing the pool's food web, Wechsler's clear, color photos provide an excellent visual counterpoint to the text. This well-focused book will open readers' eyes to an ecological feature they may have seen without recognizing.The book concludes with a glossary and a list of recommended books and Web sites. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this unique book, Judith Herrin unveils the riches of a quite different civilization. Avoiding a standard chronological account of the Byzantine Empire's millennium--long history, she identifies the fundamental questions about Byzantium--what it was, and what special significance it holds for us today.</p><br><p> Bringing the latest scholarship to a general audience in accessible prose, Herrin focuses each short chapter around a representative theme, event, monument, or historical figure, and examines it within the full sweep of Byzantine history--from the foundation of Constantinople, the magnificent capital city built by Constantine the Great, to its capture by the Ottoman Turks.</p><br><p> She argues that Byzantium's crucial role as the eastern defender of Christendom against Muslim expansion during the early Middle Ages made Europe--and the modern Western world--possible. Herrin captivates us with her discussions of all facets of Byzantine culture and society. She walks us through the complex ceremonies of the imperial court. She describes the transcendent beauty and power of the church of Hagia Sophia, as well as chariot races, monastic spirituality, diplomacy, and literature. She reveals the fascinating worlds of military usurpers and ascetics, eunuchs and courtesans, and artisans who fashioned the silks, icons, ivories, and mosaics so readily associated with Byzantine art.</p><br><p> An innovative history written by one of our foremost scholars, <i>Byzantium</i> reveals this great civilization's rise to military and cultural supremacy, its spectacular destruction by the Fourth Crusade, and its revival and final conquest in 1453.</p></p><p><p>"This book provides an introduction to Byzantium in a nonconventional fashion. It explores, in chronological order, basic questions about Byzantine history and society. I know of no other book that attempts this approach to the millennium-long history of Byzantium.

Days blurred here, and he knew it was important to remember how long he'd been trapped, waiting for the axe to fall-or not. So he diligently scratched out a record on the wall using a button from his shirt.<p>Five days. Five days since he'd arrived back in Alexandria, bringing with him Scholar Wolfe and Morgan Hault as his prisoners. They'd been taken off in different directions, and he'd been dumped here to-as they'd said-await the Archivist's pleasure.</p>The Archivist, it seemed, was a very busy man.<p>Once Jess had the days logged, he did the mental exercise of calculating the date, from pure boredom. It took him long, uneasy moments to realize why that date-today-seemed important.</p>And then he remembered and was ashamed it had taken him so long.<p>Today was the anniversary of his brother Liam's death. His elder brother.</p>And today meant that Jess was now older than Liam had ever lived to be. <br><br>He couldn't remember exactly <i>how </i>Liam had died. Could hardly remember his brother at all these days, other than a vague impression of a sharp nose and shaggy blondish hair. He must have watched Liam walk up the stairs of the scaffold and stand as the rope was fixed around his neck.<p>But he couldn't remember that, or watching the drop. Just Liam, hanging. It seemed like a painting viewed at a distance, not a memory.</p><p><i>Wish I could remember</i>, he thought. If Liam had held his head high on the way to his death, if he'd gone up the steps firmly and stood without fear, then maybe Jess would be able to do it, too. Because that was likely to be in his future.</p><p>He closed his eyes and tried to picture it: the cell door opening. Soldiers in High Garda uniforms, the army of the Great Library, waiting stone-faced in the hall. A Scholar to read the text of his choice to him on the way to execution. Perhaps a priest, if he asked for one.</p>But there, his mind went blank. He didn't know how the Archivist would end his life. Would it be a quiet death? Private? A shot in the back? Burial without a marker? Maybe nobody would ever know what had become of him.<p>Or maybe he'd end up facing the noose after all, and the steps up to it. If he could picture himself walking without flinching to his execution, perhaps he could actually <i>do </i>it.</p><p>He knew he ought to be focusing on what he would be saying to the Archivist if he was called, but at this moment, death seemed so close he could touch it, and besides, it was easier to accept failure than to dare to predict success. He'd never been especially superstitious, but imagining triumph now seemed like drawing a target on his back. No reason to offend the Egyptian gods. Not so early.</p><p>He stood up and walked the cell. Cold, barren, with bars and a flat stone shelf that pretended at being a bed. A bare toilet that needed cleaning, and the sharp smell of it was starting to squirm against his skin.</p><p><i>If I had something to read </i>. . . The thought crept in without warning, and he felt it like a personal loss. Not having a book at hand was a worse punishment than most. He was trying not to think about his death, and he was too afraid to think about the fate of Morgan or Scholar Wolfe or anything else . . . except that he could almost hear Scholar Wolfe's dry, acerbic voice telling him, <i>If only you had a brain up to the task, Brightwell, you'd never lack for something to read</i>.</p><p>Jess settled on the stone ledge, closed his eyes, and tried to clearly imagine the first page of one of his favorite books. Nothing came at his command. Just words, jumbled and frantic, that wouldn't sort themselves in order. Better if he imagined writing a letter.</p><p><i>Dear Morgan</i>, he thought. <i>I'm trapped in a holding cell inside the Serapeum, and all I can think of is that I should have done better by you, and all of us. I'm afraid all this is for nothing. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for being stupid enough to think I could outwit the Archivist. I love you. Please don't hate me.</i></p><p>That was selfish. She should hate him. He'd sent her back into the Iron Tower, a life sentence of servitude and an unbreakable collar fastened tight around her neck. He'd deceived Scholar Wolfe into a prison far worse than this one, and an inevitable death sentence. He'd betrayed everyone who'd ever trusted him, and for what?</p><p>For cleverness and a probably foolish idea that he could somehow, <i>somehow</i>, pull off a miracle. What gave him the right to even think it?</p><p><i>Clank</i>.</p><p>That was the sound of a key turning in a heavy lock.</p>Jess stood, the chill on his back left by the ledge still lingering like a ghost, and then he came to the bars as the door at the end of the hall opened. He could see the hinges move and the iron door swinging in. It wasn't locked again when it closed. <i>Careless</i>.<p>He listened to the decisive thud of footsteps against the floor, growing louder, and then three High Garda soldiers in black with golden emblems were in front of his cell. They stopped and faced him. The oldest-his close-cut hair a stiff silver brush around his head-barked in common Greek, "Step back from the bars and turn around."</p><p>Jess's skin felt flushed, then cold; he swallowed back a rush of fear and felt his pulse race in a futile attempt to outrun the inevitable. He followed the instructions. <i>They didn't lock the outer door. That's a chance, if I can get by them. </i>He could. He could sweep the legs out from under the first, use that off-balance body to knock back the other two, pull a sidearm free from one of them, shoot at least one, maybe two of them. Luck would dictate whether he'd die in the attempt, but at least he'd die fighting.</p><p><i>I don't want to die, </i>something in him that sounded like a child whispered. <i>Not like Liam. Not on the same day.</i></p><p>And suddenly, he remembered.</p><p>The London sky, iron gray. Light rain had been falling on his child's face. He'd been too short to see his brother ascend anything but the top two steps of the scaffold. Liam had stumbled on the last one, and a guard had steadied him. His brother had been shivering and slow, and he hadn't been brave after all. He'd looked out into the crowd of those gathered, and Jess remembered the searing second of eye contact with his brother before Liam transferred that stare to their father.</p><p>Jess had looked, too. Callum Brightwell had stared back without a flicker of change in his expression, as if his eldest son were a stranger.</p><p>They'd tied Liam's hands. And put a hood over his head.</p><p>A voice in the here and now snapped him out of the memory. "Against the wall. Hands behind your back."</p><p>Jess slowly moved to comply, trying to assess where the other man was . . . and froze when the barrel of a gun pressed against the back of his neck. "I know what you're thinking, son. Don't try it. I'd rather not shoot you for stupidity."</p><p>The guard had a familiar accent-raised near Manchester, most likely. His time in Alexandria had covered his English roots a bit, but it was odd, Jess thought, that he might be killed by one of his countrymen, so far from home. Killed by the English, just like Liam.</p><p>Once a set of Library restraints settled around his wrists and tightened, he felt strangely less shaken. Opportunity was gone now. All his choices had been narrowed to one course. All he had to do now was play it out.</p><p>Jess turned to look at the High Garda soldier. A man with roots from another garden, maybe one closer to Alexandria; the man had a darker complexion, dark eyes, a neat beard, and a compassionate but firm expression on his face. "Am I coming back?" he asked, and wished he hadn't.</p><p>"Likely not," the soldier said. "Wherever you go next, you won't be back here."</p><p>Jess nodded. He closed his eyes for a second and then opened them. Liam had faltered on the stairs. Had trembled. But at the end his elder brother had stood firm in his bonds and hood and waited for death without showing any fear.</p><p>He could do the same.</p><p>"Then, let's go," he said, and forced a grin he hoped looked careless. "I could do with a change of scenery."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>They didn't take him to the gallows. Not immediately, anyway. And though he half feared he'd never see the shot that would kill him from behind, they reached the end of the hall and the unlocked door without incident. <i>Lucky that Captain Santi isn't here to see that breach of security</i>, he thought. Santi would have had someone's head for it. Metaphorically speaking.</p><p>And now he wished he hadn't thought of that, because it added another possible execution method to his imagined deaths.</p><p>It was a long march through quite a number of checkpoints, each strongly manned with soldiers and automata; the sphinxes watched him with suspicious red eyes and flexed their lion claws. Of all the automata he'd faced before-lions, Spartans, once a hawk-headed Egyptian god-these were the ones that most unnerved him. Something about the human pharaoh's face made them especially inhuman. They'd have no trouble tearing him apart in these close quarters, coming as they would from either side.</p><p>Jess added it to his preferred ways not to die and was grateful when the route took them through an iron gate and into dazzling sunlight. Dying in the sun was always better than dying in the dark, wasn't it? He sucked down thick Alexandrian sea air in convulsive breaths and turned his face up to the warmth; as his eyes adjusted, he realized he was being marched through the small ornamental garden that led around to the side of the giant Alexandrian pyramid that held the Scholar Steps. Too brief a walk, one he didn't have much time to savor, before they passed into the darkness of another doorway near the base of the vast, looming structure.</p><p>Then he knew exactly where he was. He'd been here before.</p><p>The guards marched him through a long lobby guarded by gods and monsters in their niches and down a hall inscribed with hieroglyphs to a final door. Another, larger sphinx sat in an alcove, and a warning growl sounded until the soldier in charge held up his wrist to show the gold bracelet there. The sphinx subsided, and the door opened.</p><p>Jess stepped into the outer office of the single most powerful person in the world.</p><p>His guards didn't follow him in. When he looked back, they'd already turned to walk away, and the door was swinging shut.</p><p>There were guards, of course; these wore the distinctive red-slashed uniforms of the High Garda Elite, sworn to the personal protection of the Archivist, and they took custody of him without a word. Jess almost missed his old escort. He'd trained as a High Garda himself, had worn the uniform, had eaten in the same dining hall as those men. The Elites were more akin to fanatics than to soldiers. They had separate quarters. Separate training. And they were dedicated to one man, not to the protection of the Great Library.</p><p>The Elites hardly gave him a glance as they formed a tight cordon around him and marched him through the outer office, where an assistant's desk sat empty, and then through a set of massive double doors decorated with the Library's seal.</p><p>He was escorted to a heavy, ornate chair and pushed into it, and the guards immediately withdrew to stand in the shadows. They went as immobile as automata.</p><p>Jess raised his gaze to find that the head of the Great Library wasn't even bothering to look at him.</p><p>The old man looked different, Jess thought. Grayer, but somehow stronger, too, as if he'd taken up a new exercise regimen. His hair had been cropped close now, and his skin had a darker hue than before, as if he'd spent time out in the sun. Sailing, perhaps. He must have a ship or two at his disposal.</p><p>The Archivist signed official documents with quick scratches of his pen.</p><p>Jess expected to at least have the old man's attention, but the Archivist said nothing. He simply worked. In a moment, a young woman walked in with a silver tray and put a small china cup of strong coffee on the table next to Jess.</p><p>"Can't drink it, love," he said with a shrug of his shoulders, and twisted to show her his bound hands.</p><p>The Archivist sighed without looking up. "Remove his restraints, will you, please?"</p><p>The order was directed at no one in particular, but a guard immediately stepped forward to press his Library bracelet to the shackles, and they snapped apart. Jess handed them over, and the guard took up his invisibility game again. Jess picked up the coffee cup with a fleeting quirk of his lips at the lovely assistant-she was beautiful-and it was only after he saw the hurt in her eyes that he realized he should have remembered her.</p><p>And <i>Brendan </i>Brightwell certainly should have remembered her. He couldn't forget, not for a second, that he was now intent on carrying on an impersonation of his twin brother, and his brother, God help him, had carried on a secret affair with this very same young woman. Whose name he couldn't remember, no matter how he tried.</p><p><i>Get your head in the room</i>, he told himself. He wasn't Jess anymore. Couldn't be. Jess Brightwell was a dead man in Alexandria; he'd come here to set plans in motion, and he'd done it the only way he could: as his brother Brendan. His life now depended on everyone believing that he was his twin, as unlike him as it was possible to be. Sarcastic, sharp, brash, always ready with a grin or a joke or a knife in the ribs.</p><p>He returned his focus to the Archivist Magister, the head of the Great Library of Alexandria, as the old man--still without looking up--said, "Explain why I shouldn't have your head taken off here and now, prisoner."</p></p><h2>The Bells of Christmas</h2><p>Twelve-year-old Jason Bell waits impatiently for Christmas 1890.

The result? Miracles. Injuries healed, cancers cured, sight and hearing restored. Yet, as Dr. Nemeh will be the first to point out, &#x201c;the miracles are just to get our attention.&#x201d; The healings do not originate from him, but from God. It is this humility and dedication to those in need that have won him the respect and trust of laypeople and religious leaders alike. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This inspiring chronicle, beautifully told by author Maura Poston Zagrans, traces the lives of the doctor and his dedicated wife, Kathy, and brings us the uplifting stories of the many people who have been healed through one man's powerful faith. <i>Miracles Every Day</i> is a compelling reminder of God's individual and unconditional love for each one of us. Along the way you will meet the dedicated family members, volunteers, and clergy who support the Nemehs in their work. They speak of a ministry of hope, of lives changed and saved through not just the power of prayer, but through the awesome Spirit-driven power of love.</p><p><b>Maura Poston Zagrans</b> interviewed a wide spectrum of professionals and academics in writing this nonfiction narrative of Reverend David T.

Maura, a mother of six, is author of <i>Camerado, I Give You My Hand</i>.<b>1. A Vision Fulfilled <br><br></b>Ten thousand people came seeking not just a miracle. They came in search of <i>their</i> miracle. <br><br>On March 13, 2005, they came to Garfield Heights, Ohio, to Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church by private ambulance, in motorized lift vans, and in sedans displaying handicapped hangtags. They came alone and they came with families. They walked with heads held high and they hobbled through the parking lot on crutches. They stood in Disney World&#x2013;long lines that snaked across a network of sidewalks crisscrossing the parish campus. They came looking for hope. They came looking for healing. At twenty-one degrees and with a piercing wind blowing, many would later recall the desperation of the day wrapped in a memory of brittle cold. <br><br>Constructed in the 1950s, the Romanesque church seats eight hundred beneath her graceful arches and towering col�umns. Painted murals and stained-glass windows depict St. Paul&#x2019;s conversion on the road to Damascus and the primacy of St. Peter, among other images. As caretakers pushed loved ones up the aisles, some in wheelchairs, some on hospital gur�neys, hymns were being played by the pipe organist in the loft above. Canes, crutches, and walkers could be seen throughout the dense gathering, hard evidence of injuries, disease, or just the physical deterioration of old age. In the pews, bald children pressed close to their parents. <br><br>People entered the church filled with a mixture of faith and skepticism, trust and fear, acceptance and anger. They braved the frigid weather and then waited many hours inside, lured by a glimmer of hope that they might be released from the pain in their bodies and the suffering in their questioning souls. They came because they had heard that Dr. Issam Nemeh would lay his hands on each one of them, one person at a time, and say a prayer that each would be healed. <br><br>For Dr. Nemeh, this day was the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice. Over the course of two decades he had laid the foundation for this moment by working as an anes�thesiologist who sat beside his recovering patients in hushed hospital rooms, and then as an acupuncture practitioner in pri�vate practice. When Issam was fifteen years old he had a vision that he would share his gift of faith with thousands, but first he would have to form a solid base for this ministry with a medical practice. <br><br>Dr. Nemeh was a physician licensed by the State Medical Board of Ohio with specialties in anesthesiology and general surgery but switched midcareer to the practice of Meridian Regulatory Acupuncture. He says he made the career change in response to a message from God that said this new practice would give him time to work with people one on one. Indeed, patients have reported treatment sessions lasting one, two, and sometimes even three hours. <br><br>Many patients came to the doctor in a last-ditch effort, after having been told by mainstream medicine there was noth�<br>ing more that could be done to alleviate their pain, treat their cancer, heal their handicaps, or save their lives. All the while the doctor was bent over his patients administering acupuncture, he prayed. Many patients received dramatic healings: tumors disappeared; multiple sclerosis melted away; vision returned to the blind and hearing to the deaf; migraines vanished; clinical depression was lifted; nerves were regenerated; learning dis�abilities vaporized; people relegated to wheelchairs stood and walked for the first time in years. <br><br>Through the years, when patients were restored to health af�ter medical science had said cures were impossible, they wanted to share their stories with the media. Dr. Nemeh redirected them. He requested that they spread the word only to the sick and suffering. In the meantime, he waited for a sign from God that it was time to bring the praying from behind the closed doors of his practice out into the public forum. <br><br>Dr. Nemeh&#x2019;s acupuncture practice grew by means of word�of-mouth referrals from his patients. A nun living in Parma, Ohio, began hearing about Dr. Nemeh from people who came to her chapel to worship at her Wednesday night healing Masses. This feisty sixty-six-year-old born in County Mayo, Ireland, would herself become a patient. After the doctor helped Sister Monica Marie Navin, she proposed that Dr. Nemeh partici�pate in celebrating her miracle with a Mass of Thanksgiving, after which he would pray over seventy-five invited guests, one at a time. And so it began. <br><br>Like a far-off stampede that is felt and heard before it is seen, word of the doctor&#x2019;s gift spread from the whispers of his patients, who told stories of their healings to loved ones and friends. One of those who caught word of what was going on was Emmy Award&#x2013;winning Cleveland News Channel 5&#x2019;s lead anchor Ted Henry. He heard the rumblings, investigated, and in November 2004 broke the story of this quiet man whose touch was sought by many. <br><br>Intrigued by his initial investigation and the testimonials of astonishing cures coming from people from so many walks of life, Henry continued his research. He developed an eleven-part report that began airing on Cleveland&#x2019;s News Channel 5 on February 20, 2005. WEWS TV 5 cameras had filmed Cleveland Bishop Anthony M. Pilla celebrating a healing ser�vice liturgy at St. Mary&#x2019;s Chapel on the campus of St. Ignatius High School, and some weeks later Bishop Pilla granted Henry an interview in which he probed the bishop on the Catholic Church&#x2019;s official stance on miracles. In that interview Bishop Pilla explained, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s clear in Catholic teaching that miracles are possible&#x2014;that healing can take place. This is not just magic. We pray to God and then patiently and humbly we wait for God&#x2019;s response, which is always what&#x2019;s best for us.&#x201d; <br><br>Henry&#x2019;s report included video footage of Dr. Nemeh giv�ing a lecture at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and praying at public healing services. Viewers did not see a bombastic, aggressive showman preaching and preen�ing onstage before a congregation. What they saw was a quiet, dignified man praying in an atmosphere of solemn decorum, a gentleman in every sense of the word. In his interview, when Henry asked Bishop Pilla why he had chosen to sanction the doctor&#x2019;s work by officiating at the St. Mary&#x2019;s healing service, Bishop Pilla offered commentary on the style and motives of both Dr. Nemeh and his wife, Kathy. He said, &#x201c;They&#x2019;re not looking for any sensationalism. They&#x2019;re not looking for any personal reward or praise or adulation. They&#x2019;re just doing this as part of their faith commitment, their belief that God can heal and that every person can be an instrument of that healing.&#x201d; <br><br>At the end of Ted Henry&#x2019;s nightly reports, TV 5 flashed a banner across the television screen detailing information about the next scheduled public healing service to be held immediately following the noon Mass on March 13 at Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Garfield Heights. City police, fire officials, and church personnel braced for a crowd they estimated would be somewhere between three thousand and four thousand peo�ple. Their estimate was off by as many as seven thousand. <br><br><b>2. &nbsp;Plans<br></b><br>Two weeks before the healing service, Father Ted Marszal, pastor at Sts. Peter and Paul, and the parish&#x2019;s lead event coordinator, retired police officer Al Strnad, met with Kathy Nemeh and three of her volunteers to try to anticipate the needs of a crowd four to five times the capacity of the church, and to develop strategies to handle those needs. Diane Sloven-ski, the parish secretary, missed most of the dialogue because they had installed a new line to handle the deluge of calls re�questing admission to the healing service, and that new phone never stopped ringing. Elaborate preparations were made for conducting the flow of traffic, including the establishment of a parking lot traffic control team. Maps giving directions to ten off-site parking facilities and area restaurants were printed so that they could be distributed to drivers who would have to be redirected from the church parking lot after it filled up. Home�owners and businesses in the neighborhood were alerted, and most everyone offered whatever parking facilities were at their disposal. Al conducted two instructional sessions to train 250 parishioners who volunteered for one-hour shifts. Yet when the day came, once the volunteers arrived at their posts many of them did not want to leave and go home. They were motivated by an overwhelming desire to serve. They also wanted to re�main as long as possible in what they were experiencing as an intensely spiritual atmosphere. So Al then had to struggle with how to place these dozens of extra people into already over�crowded conditions. <br><br>Sts. Peter and Paul staff salted the sidewalks; overstocked the restrooms with paper towels, toilet paper, and cleaning sup�plies; and were poised to put in some overtime. They also pre�pared the school activity center, a combination athletics facility and social hall located across the courtyard from the church, by setting up five hundred folding chairs and a small but pretty altar on the stage in this cavernous room. Bishop Roger W. Gries was recruited to celebrate Mass in this makeshift chapel at noon. Throughout the day the building would provide shel�ter from the cold as people waited for space in the church pews to become available. Once inside the church, everyone would settle in for another long wait. Priests and chaplains from other parishes offered the sacrament of the anointing of the sick; they would go through several quarts of holy oil before the day ended. <br><br>The Nemehs had accepted an offer of assistance from Brecksville firefighter Lieutenant Patrick Coleman, who had received an instantaneous healing of an untreatable digestive disorder after a prayer from Dr. Nemeh at a service back in 2003. Kathy placed Patrick in charge of crowd control. He was the emissary and troubleshooter on behalf of the Nemeh min�istry, the parallel of Al Strnad at Sts. Peter and Paul. <br><br>The Garfield Heights chief of police and fire chief both planned to be on-site the entire day. To everyone&#x2019;s credit, prep�arations were so thorough the day would end without a single incident. <br><br>On the morning of the event, choppers hovered in the air and fed Cleveland&#x2019;s local news stations video of a constant crawl of traffic on the highway and lines of people streaming toward the church. Every Cleveland television station planted a live truck in the church parking lot, and reporters went live at each broadcast. When the six o&#x2019;clock news announced that the doctor was still praying, Patrick faced a fresh onslaught of vehicles trying to find places to park. <br>After the numbered tickets had been collected and the traf�fic patterns analyzed from helicopter videotape, the Garfield Heights Police Department provided an estimate of how many people had made a pilgrimage to Sts. Peter and Paul Church that day. Everyone was astonished to learn that not three or four thousand but more than <i>ten</i> thousand people had de�scended upon the Garfield Heights parish. <br><br>Everyone, that is, but Dr. Nemeh. For him it was all simply part of God&#x2019;s plan.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Clothing from the Hands That Weave</h2><p><p><i>Clothing from the Hands that Weave</i> is a remarkable book that traces the history of weaving and fashion from the beginning of time through the modern era.

Detailed descriptions and analyses of ancient clothing styles and construction techniques are combined with wildly creative and exciting ideas for updating and adapting them. From simple loom-shaped rectangles to a stunning, entirely hand-woven wardrobe, this book has got it all. Filled to the brim with notes, tips, patterns, and more, <i>Clothing from the Hands that Weave</i> is truly one-of-a-kind among weaving books.</p></p><p>I discovered between the pages of this book an intriguing historical recounting of clothing. I was immediately drawn into a presentation of rectangular garments from cultures around the world. Wrapped, draped, toga-style dress that we've all tried to duplicate time and time again for a Greek party or Halloween is outlined step-by-step. The possibilities as to what you can do with a piece of fabric are endless. Ancient cultures made complete wardrobes usually without sewing or fasteners.

So despite the oppressive July heat, she returns to Rome, leaving them at their place on the coast. Albia, daughter of Marcus Didius Falco, the famed private informer (now retired), has taken up her father's former profession, and it's time to get back to work. The first order of business, however, is the corpse that was found in a chest sent as part of a large lot to be sold by the Falco family auction house. As the senior family representative in Rome, it falls upon Albia to identify the corpse, find out why he was killed, who killed him, and, most important, how did it end up in the chest. </p><p>At the same time, her potential young man, Faustus, comes looking for help with his friend Sextus's political campaign. Between the auction business and Roman politics, it's not quite clear which one is the more underhanded and duplicitous.

Somewhere out beyond Hollywood, resting actress Maria Wyeth drifts along the freeway in perpetual motion, anaesthetized to pain and pleasure, seemingly untainted by her personal history. She finds herself, in her early thirties, radically divorced from husband, lovers, friends, her own past and her own future. Play It As It Lays is set in a place beyond good and evil, literally in Los Angeles and Las Vegas and the barren wastes of the Mojave, but figuratively in the landscape of the arid soul. Capturing the mood of an entire generation, Didion chose Hollywood to serve as her microcosm of contemporary society and exposed a culture characterized by emptiness and ennui. Two decades after its original publication, it remains a profoundly disturbing novel, an immaculately wrought portrait of a world (California on the cusp of the 70s) where too much freedom made a lot of people ill.</p><p><b>Joan Didion</b> is the author of many works of fiction and nonfiction, as well as several screenplays written with her late husband, John Gregory Dunne.

Encompassing a grand sweep of human history, A History of the World in 100 Objects begins with one of the earliest surviving objects made by human hands, a chopping tool from the Olduvai gorge in Africa, and ends with objects which characterise the world we live in today. Seen through MacGregor&#39;s eyes, history is a kaleidoscope - shifting, interconnected, constantly surprising, and shaping our world today in ways that most of us have never imagined. A stone pillar tells us about a great Indian emperor preaching tolerance to his people; Spanish pieces of eight tell us about the beginning of a global currency; and an early Victorian tea-set speaks to us about the impact of empire. An intellectual and visual feast, this is one of the most engrossing and unusual history books published in years. &#39;Brilliant, engagingly written, deeply researched&#39; Mary Beard, Guardian &#39;A triumph: hugely popular, and rightly lauded as one of the most effective and intellectually ambitious initiatives in the making of &#39;public history&#39; for many decades&#39; Sunday Telegraph &#39;Highly intelligent, delightfully written and utterly absorbing &#39; Timothy Clifford, Spectator &#39;This is a story book, vivid and witty, shining with insights, connections, shocks and delights&#39; Gillian Reynolds Daily Telegraph</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2011</strong>: In <i>A History of the World in 100 Objects</i>, Neal MacGregor, director of the British Museum, takes readers on a tour of the world by way of its material goods. From everyday items such as pots, utensils, and money to valuables such as art and jewelry, MacGregor shows that the things humans have left behind are often as rich and informative as written texts. Whether it&#x2019;s a strange and unique object like a throne made of rifles from Mozambique or a medieval German crystal, or a familiar one like a sculpture of the head of Augustus or Hokusai's painting <i>The Great Wave</i>, MacGregor skillfully weaves each one into the fabric of the society that it came from. In that sense, the book is much more than a museum catalog: it's a hundred keyhole views into a hundred different societies from around the world and throughout history.Neil MacGregor has been Director of the British Museum since August 2002. He was Director of the National Gallery in London from 1987 to 2002.

Original.</p><p>Tony Kushner's <i>Angels in America</i> is that rare entity: a work for the stage that is profoundly moving yet very funny, highly theatrical yet steeped in traditional literary values, and most of all deeply American in its attitudes and political concerns. In two full-length plays--<i>Millennium Approaches</i> and <i>Perestroika</i>--Kushner tells the story of a handful of people trying to make sense of the world. Prior is a man living with AIDS whose lover Louis has left him and become involved with Joe, an ex-Mormon and political conservative whose wife, Harper, is slowly having a nervous breakdown. These stories are contrasted with that of Roy Cohn (a fictional re-creation of the infamous American conservative ideologue who died of AIDS in 1986) and his attempts to remain in the closet while trying to find some sort of personal salvation in his beliefs.<p> But such a summary does not do justice to Kushner's grand plan, which mixes magical realism with political speeches, high comedy with painful tragedy, and stitches it all together with a daring sense of irony and a moral vision that demands respect and attention. On one level, the play is an indictment of the government led by Ronald Reagan, from the blatant disregard for the AIDS crisis to the flagrant political corruption. But beneath the acute sense of political and moral outrage lies a meditation on what it means to live and die--of AIDS, or anything else--in a society that cares less and less about human life and basic decency. The play's breadth and internal drive is matched by its beautiful writing and unbridled compassion. Winner of two Tony Awards and the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for drama, <i>Angels in America</i> is one of the most outstanding plays of the American theater. <i>--Michael Bronski</i></p>Tony Kushner&#39;s plays include A Bright Room Called Day and Slavs!; as well as adaptations of Corneille&#39;s The Illusion, Ansky&#39;s The Dybbuk, Brecht&#39;s The Good Person of Szecguan and Goethe&#39;s Stella. Current projects include: Henry Box Brown or The Mirror of Slavery; and two musical plays: St. Cecilia or The Power of Music and Caroline or Change. His collaboration with Maurice Sendak on an American version of the children&#39;s opera, Brundibar, appeared in book form Fall 2003. Kushner grew up in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and he lives in New York.</p><h2>Manchild in the Promised Land: A Modern Classic of the Black Experience</h2><p>The autobiography of Claude Brown from his childhood amidst the temptations and frustrations of Harlem to the triumph over himself and his surroundings</p><p><b>Nathan McCall</b>, author of <i>Makes Me Wanna Holler</i>, has worked as a journalist for <i>The Washington Post</i>.

I&#x2019;m shot!&#x201d;<br> <br>I could hear Turk&#x2019;s voice calling from a far distance, telling me not to go into the fish-and-chips joint. I heard, but I didn&#x2019;t understand. The only thing I knew was that I was going to die.<br> <br>I ran. There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all thirteen years of it.<br> <br>I climbed up on the bar yelling, &#x201c;Walsh, I&#x2019;m shot. I&#x2019;m shot.&#x201d; I could feel the blood running down my leg. Walsh, the fellow who operated the fish-and-chips joint, pushed me off the bar and onto the floor. I couldn&#x2019;t move now, but I was still completely conscious.<br> <br>Walsh was saying, &#x201c;Git outta here, kid. I ain&#x2019;t got no time to play.&#x201d;<br> <br>A woman was screaming, mumbling something about the Lord, and saying, &#x201c;Somebody done shot that poor child.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mama ran in. She jumped up and down, screaming like a crazy woman. I began to think about dying. The worst part of dying was thinking about the things and the people that I&#x2019;d never see again. As I lay there trying to imagine what being dead was like, the policeman who had been trying to control Mama gave up and bent over me. He asked who had shot me. Before I could answer, he was asking me if I could hear him. I told him that I didn&#x2019;t know who had shot me and would he please tell Mama to stop jumping up and down. Every time Mama came down on that shabby floor, the bullet lodged in my stomach felt like a hot poker.<br> <br>Another policeman had come in and was struggling to keep the crowd outside. I could see Turk in the front of the crowd. Before the cops came, he asked me if I was going to tell them that he was with me. I never answered. I looked at him and wondered if he saw who shot me. Then his question began to ring in my head: &#x201c;Sonny, you gonna tell &#x2019;em I was with you?&#x201d; I was bleeding on a dirty floor in a fish-and-chips joint, and Turk was standing there in the doorway hoping that I would die before I could tell the cops that he was with me. Not once did Turk ask me how I felt.<br> <br>Hell, yeah, I thought, I&#x2019;m gonna tell &#x2019;em.<br> <br>It seemed like hours had passed before the ambulance finally arrived. Mama wanted to go to the hospital with me, but the ambulance attendant said she was too excited. On the way to Harlem Hospital, the cop who was riding with us asked Dad what he had to say. His answer was typical: &#x201c;I told him about hanging out with those bad-ass boys.&#x201d; The cop was a little surprised. This must be a rookie, I thought.<br> <br>The next day, Mama was at my bedside telling me that she had prayed and the Lord had told her that I was going to live. Mama said that many of my friends wanted to donate some blood for me, but the hospital would not accept it from narcotics users.<br> <br>This was one of the worst situations I had ever been in. There was a tube in my nose that went all the way to the pit of my stomach. I was being fed intravenously, and there was a drain in my side. Everybody came to visit me, mainly out of curiosity. The girls were all anxious to know where I had gotten shot. They had heard all kinds of tales about where the bullet struck. The bolder ones wouldn&#x2019;t even bother to ask: they just snatched the cover off me and looked for themselves. In a few days, the word got around that I was in one piece.<br> <br>On my fourth day in the hospital, I was awakened by a male nurse at about 3 A.M. When he said hello in a very ladyish voice, I thought that he had come to the wrong bed by mistake. After identifying himself, he told me that he had helped Dr. Freeman save my life. The next thing he said, which I didn&#x2019;t understand, had something to do with the hours he had put in working that day. He went on mumbling something about how tired he was and ended up asking me to rub his back. I had already told him that I was grateful to him for helping the doctor save my life. While I rubbed his back above the beltline, he kept pushing my hand down and saying, &#x201c;Lower, like you are really grateful to me.&#x201d; I told him that I was sleepy from the needle a nurse had given me. He asked me to pat his behind. After I had done this, he left.<br> <br>The next day when the fellows came to visit me, I told them about my early-morning visitor. Dunny said he would like to meet him. Tito joked about being able to get a dose of clap in the hospital. The guy with the tired back never showed up again, so the fellows never got a chance to meet him. Some of them were disappointed.<br> <br>After I had been in the hospital for about a week, I was visited by another character. I had noticed a woman visiting one of the patients on the far side of the ward. She was around fifty-five years old, short and fat, and she was wearing old-lady shoes. While I wondered who this woman was, she started across the room in my direction. After she had introduced herself, she told me that she was visiting her son. Her son had been stabbed in the chest with an ice pick by his wife. She said that his left lung had been punctured, but he was doing fine now, and that Jesus was so-o-o good.<br> <br>Her name was Mrs. Ganey, and she lived on 145th Street. She said my getting shot when I did &#x201c;was the work of the Lord.&#x201d; My gang had been stealing sheets and bedspreads off clotheslines for months before I had gotten shot. I asked this godly woman why she thought it was the work of the Lord or Jesus or whoever. She began in a sermonlike tone, saying, &#x201c;Son, people was gitting tired-a y&#x2019;all stealing all dey sheets and spreads.&#x201d; She said that on the night that I had gotten shot, she baited her clothesline with two brand-new bedspreads, turned out all the lights in the apartment, and sat at the kitchen window waiting for us to show.<br> <br>She waited with a double-barreled shotgun.<br> <br>The godly woman said that most of our victims thought that we were winos or dope fiends and that most of them had vowed to kill us. At the end of the sermon, the godly woman said, &#x201c;Thank the Lord I didn&#x2019;t shoot nobody&#x2019;s child.&#x201d; When the godly woman had finally departed, I thought, Thank the Lord for taking her away from my bed.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Later on that night, I was feeling a lot of pain and couldn&#x2019;t get to sleep. A nurse who had heard me moaning and groaning came over and gave me a shot of morphine. Less than twenty minutes later, I was deep into a nightmare.<br> <br>I was back in the fish-and-chips joint, lying on the floor dying. Only, now I was in more pain than before, and there were dozens of Mamas around me jumping up and screaming. I could feel myself dying in a rising pool of blood. The higher the blood rose the more I died.<br> <br>I dreamt about the boy who Rock and big Stoop had thrown off that roof on 149th Street. None of us had stayed around to see him hit the ground, but I just knew that he died in a pool of blood too. I wished that he would stop screaming, and I wished that Mama would stop screaming. I wished they would let me die quietly.<br> <br>As the screams began to die out&#x2014;Mama&#x2019;s and the boy&#x2019;s&#x2014;I began to think about the dilapidated old tenement building that I lived in, the one that still had the words &#x201c;pussy&#x201d; and &#x201c;fuck you&#x201d; on the walls where I had scribbled them years ago. The one where the super, Mr. Lawson, caught my little brother writing some more. Dad said he was going to kill Pimp for writing on that wall, and the way he was beating Pimp with that ironing cord, I thought he would. Mama was crying, I was crying, and Pimp had been crying for a long time. Mama said that he was too young to be beaten like that. She ran out of the house and came back with a cop, who stopped Dad from beating Pimp.<br> <br>I told Pimp not to cry any more, just to wait until I got big: I was going to kill Dad, and he could help me if he wanted to.<br> <br>This was the building where Mr. Lawson had killed a man for peeing in the hall. I remembered being afraid to go downstairs the morning after Mr. Lawson had busted that man&#x2019;s head open with a baseball bat. I could still see blood all over the hall. This was the building where somebody was always shooting out the windows in the hall. They were usually shooting at Johnny D., and they usually missed. This was the building that I loved more than anyplace else in the world. The thought that I would never see this building again scared the hell out of me.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I dreamt about waking up in the middle of the night seven years before and thinking that the Germans or the Japs had come and that the loud noises I heard were bombs falling. Running into Mama&#x2019;s room, I squeezed in between her and Dad at the front window. Thinking that we were watching an air raid, I asked Dad where the sirens were and why the street lights were on. He said, &#x201c;This ain&#x2019;t no air raid&#x2014;just a whole lotta niggers gone fool. And git the hell back in that bed!&#x201d; I went back to bed, but I couldn&#x2019;t go to sleep. The loud screams in the street and the crashing sound of falling plate-glass windows kept me awake for hours. While I listened to the noise, I imagined bombs falling and people running through the streets screaming. I could see mothers running with babies in their arms, grown men running over women and children to save their own lives, and the Japs stabbing babies with bayonets, just like in the movies. I thought, Boy, I sure wish I was out there. I bet the Stinky brothers are out there. Danny and Butch are probably out there having all the fun in the world.<br> <br>The next day, as I was running out of the house without underwear or socks on, I could hear Mama yelling, &#x201c;Boy, come back here and put a hat or something on your head!&#x201d; When I reached the stoop, I was knocked back into the hall by a big man carrying a ham under his coat. While I looked up at him, wondering what was going on, he reached down with one hand and snatched me up, still holding the ham under his coat with his other hand. He stood me up against a wall and ran into the hall with his ham. Before I had a chance to move, other men came running through the hall carrying cases of whiskey, sacks of flour, and cartons of cigarettes. Just as I unglued myself from the wall and started out the door for the second time, I was bowled over again. This time by a cop with a gun in his hand. He never stopped, but after he had gone a couple of yards into the hall, I heard him say, &#x201c;Look out, kid.&#x201d; On the third try, I got out of the building. But I wasn&#x2019;t sure that this was my street. None of the stores had any windows left, and glass was everywhere. It seemed that all the cops in the world were on 145th Street and Eighth Avenue that day. The cops were telling everybody to move on, and everybody was talking about the riot. I went over to a cop and asked him what a riot was. He told me to go on home. The next cop I asked told me that a riot was what had happened the night before. Putting two and two together I decided that a riot was &#x201c;a whole lotta niggers gone fool.&#x201d;<br> <br>I went around the corner to Butch&#x2019;s house. After I convinced him that I was alone, he opened the door. He said that Kid and Danny were in the kitchen. I saw Kid sitting on the floor with his hand stuck way down in a gallon jar of pickled pigs&#x2019; ears. Danny was cooking some bacon at the stove, and Butch was busy hiding stuff. It looked as though these guys had stolen a whole grocery store. While I joined the feast, they took turns telling me about the riot. Danny and Kid hadn&#x2019;t gone home the night before; they were out following the crowds and looting.<br> <br>My only regret was that I had missed the excitement. I said, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t we have another riot tonight? Then Butch and me can get in it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Danny said that there were too many cops around to have a riot now. Butch said that they had eaten up all the bread and that he was going to steal some more. I asked if I could come along with him, and he said that I could if I promised to do nothing but watch. I promised, but we both knew that I was lying.<br> <br>When we got to the street, Butch said he wanted to go across the street and look at the pawnshop. I tagged along. Like many of the stores where the rioters had been, the pawnshop had been set afire. The firemen had torn down a sidewall getting at the fire. So Butch and I just walked in where the wall used to be. Everything I picked up was broken or burned or both. My feet kept sinking into the wet furs that had been burned and drenched. The whole place smelled of smoke and was as dirty as a Harlem gutter on a rainy day. The cop out front yelled to us to get out of there. He only had to say it once.<br> <br>After stopping by the seafood joint and stealing some shrimp and oysters, we went to what was left of Mr. Gordon&#x2019;s grocery store. Butch just walked in, picked up a loaf of bread, and walked out. He told me to come on, but I ignored him and went into the grocery store instead. I picked up two loaves of bread and walked out. When I got outside, a cop looked at me, and I ran into a building and through the backyard to Butch&#x2019;s house. Running through the backyard, I lost all the oysters that I had; when I reached Butch&#x2019;s house, I had only two loaves of bread and two shrimp in my pocket.<br> <br>Danny, who was doing most of the cooking, went into the street to steal something to drink. Danny, Butch, and Kid were ten years old, four years older than I. Butch was busy making sandwiches on the floor, and Kid was trying to slice up a loaf of bologna. I had never eaten shrimp, but nobody seemed to care, because they refused to cook it for me. I told Butch that I was going to cook it myself. He said that there was no more lard in the house and that I would need some grease.<br> <br>I looked around the house until I came up with some Vaseline hair pomade. I put the shrimp in the frying pan with the hair grease, waited until they had gotten black and were smoking, then took them out and made a sandwich. A few years later, I found out that shrimp were supposed to be shelled before cooking. I ate half of the sandwich and hated shrimp for years afterward.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>The soft hand tapping on my face to wake me up was Jackie&#x2019;s. She and Della had been to a New Year&#x2019;s Eve party. Jackie wanted to come by the hospital and kiss me at midnight. This was the only time in my life that I ever admitted being glad to see Jackie. I asked them about the party, hoping that they would stay and talk to me for a while. I was afraid that if I went back to sleep, I would have another bad dream.<br> <br>The next thing I knew, a nurse was waking me up for breakfast. I didn&#x2019;t recall saying good night to Jackie and Della, so I must have fallen asleep while they were talking to me. I thought about Sugar, how nice she was, and how she was a real friend. I knew she wanted to be my girl friend, and I liked her a lot. But what would everybody say if I had a buck-toothed girl friend. I remembered Knoxie asking me how I kissed her. That question led to the first fight I&#x2019;d had with Knoxie in years. No, I couldn&#x2019;t let Sugar be my girl. It was hard enough having her as a friend.<br> <br>The next day, I asked the nurse why she hadn&#x2019;t changed my bed linen, and she said because they were evicting me. I had been in the hospital for eleven days, but I wasn&#x2019;t ready to go home. I left the hospital on January 2 and went to a convalescent home in Valhalla, New York. After I had been there for three weeks, the activity director took me aside and told me that I was going to New York City to see a judge and that I might be coming back. The following morning, I left to see that judge, but I never got back to Valhalla.<br> <br>I stood there before Judge Pankin looking solemn and lying like a professional. I thought that he looked too nice to be a judge. A half hour after I had walked into the courtroom, Judge Pankin was telling me that he was sending ...</p><h2>Eye of the Pharoah: 9</h2><p>Dozens of pop-ups, pull-out dossiers, flaps, and secret labels provide clues to the identity of the thief who stole the pharaoh&#39;s priceless jewel, leading to three different solutions</p><p>Kids will relish an unusual pop-up whodunit which features three possible endings.

Judging from the haunting, beautifully reproduced paintings and drawings in the book--which range from the iconic to the rarely seen--it is easy to see why hordes of people keep pressing through overcrowded galleries to get a glimpse of the originals. The ones here are all from the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, where most of Vincent's work resides. <p> Author Richard Kendall does a heroic job of writing van Gogh's tortured story one more time. Few artists have analyzed their own work with the clarity and insight Vincent brought to his. And Kendall relies heavily on Vincent's letters to his brother Theo, giving the reader broad access to the ultimate expert, the painter himself. The wealth of color plates is intoxicating--70 paintings, including <i>The Potato Eaters</i> and other early, gloomy works, a dozen self-portraits, <i>Almond Blossom</i>, <i>Wheatfield with Crows</i>, <i>Butterflies and Poppies</i>, <i>The Bedroom</i>, <i>The Zouave</i>, and <i>The Courtesan</i> (van Gogh's take on a Japanese geisha in full regalia).</p><p> It seems trivial to further praise the book's designers for holding it to only 150 pages, but the length makes an important difference.

The third edition of this monumental study of folklore, magic, and religion was abridged by the authour into this single volume in 1922.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Before Joseph Campbell became the world's most famous practitioner of comparative mythology, there was Sir James George Frazer. <i>The Golden Bough</i> was originally published in two volumes in 1890, but Frazer became so enamored of his topic that over the next few decades he expanded the work sixfold, then in 1922 cut it all down to a single thick edition suitable for mass distribution. The thesis on the origins of magic and religion that it elaborates "will be long and laborious," Frazer warns readers, "but may possess something of the charm of a voyage of discovery, in which we shall visit many strange lands, with strange foreign peoples, and still stranger customs." Chief among those customs--at least as the book is remembered in the popular imagination--is the sacrificial killing of god-kings to ensure bountiful harvests, which Frazer traces through several cultures, including in his elaborations the myths of Adonis, Osiris, and Balder.<p> While highly influential in its day, <i>The Golden Bough</i> has come under harsh critical scrutiny in subsequent decades, with many of its descriptions of regional folklore and legends deemed less than reliable. Furthermore, much of its tone is rooted in a philosophy of social Darwinism--sheer cultural imperialism, really--that finds its most explicit form in Frazer's rhetorical question: "If in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of the world have also at some period of their history passed through a similar intellectual phase?" (The truly civilized races, he goes on to say later, though not particularly loudly, are the ones whose minds evolve beyond religious belief to embrace the rational structures of scientific thought.) Frazer was much too genteel to state plainly that "primitive" races believe in magic because they are too stupid and backwards to know any better; instead he remarks that "a savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the supernatural." And he certainly was not about to make explicit the logical extension of his theories--"that Christian legend, dogma, and ritual" (to quote Robert Graves's summation of Frazer in <i>The White Goddess</i>) "are the refinement of a great body of primitive and barbarous beliefs." Whatever modern readers have come to think of the book, however, its historical significance and the eloquence with which Frazer attempts to develop what one might call a unifying theory of anthropology cannot be denied. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>This greatly revised and enlarged twelve-volume third edition (1911-15) of the controversial work by Sir James Frazer (1854-1941) applies the techniques of comparative ethnography to classical religion. Volumes 10 and 11 (1913) continue to examine taboo behaviour, and consider the role of sunlight and firelight in ritual.</p><h2>If You Lived With The Sioux Indians</h2><p><b>What if you lived with the Sioux Indians?</b><br><br>If you lived with the Sioux Indians<br>--Would you hunt for food?<br>--What kind of home would you live in?<br>--What would be the bravest thing you could do?<br><br>This book tells you what it was like to live as a Sioux Indian in North and South Dakota during the years 1800 to 1850.</p><p>Ann McGovern has written over 35 children&#39;s books, including STONE SOUP; several books in the IF YOU LIVED... series; and SCRAM, KID!

Fearful that plutonium would cause a cancer epidemic among workers, Manhattan Project doctors embarked on a human experiment that was as chilling as it was closely guarded: the systematic injection of unsuspecting Americans with radioactive plutonium. In this shocking expos�, Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Eileen Welsome reveals the unspeakable scientific trials that reduced thousands of American men, women, and even children to nameless specimens with silvery radioactive metal circulating in their veins. Spanning the 1930s to the 1990s, filled with hundreds of newly declassified documents and firsthand interviews, <b>The Plutonium Files</b> traces the behind-the-scenes story of an extraordinary fifty-year cover-up. It illuminates a shadowy chapter in this country's history and gives eloquent voice to the men and women who paid for our atomic energy discoveries with their health--and sometimes their lives.</p><p>As World War II reached its climax, the U.S. push to create an atomic bomb spawned an industry the size of General Motors almost overnight. But a little-understood human dilemma quickly arose: How was all the radiation involved in building and testing the bomb going to affect the countless researchers, soldiers, and civilians exposed to it? Government scientists scrambled to find out, fearing cancer outbreaks and worse, but in their urgency conducted classified experiments that bordered on the horrific: MIT researchers fed radioactive oatmeal to residents of a state boys' school outside Boston; prisoners in Washington and Oregon were subjected to crippling blasts of direct radiation; and patients with terminal illnesses (or so it was hoped) were secretly injected with large doses of plutonium--survivors were surreptitiously monitored for years afterward.<p> It was these plutonium guinea pigs that set journalist Eileen Welsome on her decade-long search to expose this grisly chapter of America's atomic age, a feat that would earn her the Pulitzer Prize. In the impressively thorough and compelling <i>Plutonium Files</i>, Welsome recounts her work with a reporter's gift for description, characterizing early radiation researchers as "a curious blend of spook, scientist, and soldier," tirelessly interviewing survivors and their families, and providing social and political context for a complex and far-reaching scandal. Perhaps most damning is that not only did these cold-war experiments violate everything from the Hippocratic Oath to the Nuremberg Code, Welsome reveals, they were often ill-conceived, inconclusive, and repetitive--"they were not just immoral science, they were bad science." <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>"A deeply shocking and important expos�...

He received Bachelor of Architecture (1960) and Master of Architecture (1972) degrees from McGill University in Montreal. He is the author of more than fifty articles and papers on the subject of housing, architecture, and technology, including the books <b>Taming the Tiger</b>, <b>Paper Heroes</b>, <b>The Most Beautiful House in the World</b>, <b>Waiting for the Weekend</b>, and <b>Looking Around: A Journey Through Architecture</b> (all available in Penguin), and most recently, <b>City Life</b>. He lives with his wife, Shirley Hallam, in Philadelphia and is the Martin and Margy Myerson Professor of Urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania.As a young architect, Rybczynski felt trapped inside a paper world of blueprints and cardboard models and itched for the nitty-gritty experience of building with his own hands. He soon devised a plan of escape. It was modest enough--to design and build a boatshed--but it was the beginning of a creative journey that questioned the nature of architecture and the architect's role: What makes a cathedral but not, say, a boatshed architecture? When should an architect design iconoclastic solutions to old problems, when to apply traditional principles? As Rybczynski writes of how his concept of a shed evolved into a full-fledged house, he discusses his wide-ranging research, meditates on the varied sources of his inspiration and on the "game" of architecture. He also incorporates the kind of historical tidbit that keeps the reader turning pages--the ritualistic origins of the elements of classical architecture; the not-quite-tongue-in-cheek parallels between architecture and gastronomy; the distinguished structural descendants of the humble barn. Written with the easy-going charm that marked his Home: A Short History of an Idea , this delightful ramble through the creative process will beguile architecture buffs and general readers alike.

She never married&#x2014;was her choice to remain single tied to the chilling fate of her mother, Anne Boleyn? An enthralling epic that is also an amazingly intimate portrait, <i>The Life of Elizabeth I</i> is a mesmerizing, stunning reading experience.</p><p>The long life and powerful personality of England's beloved Virgin Queen have eternal appeal, and popular historian Alison Weir depicts both with panache. She's especially good at evoking the physical texture of Tudor England: the elaborate royal gowns (actually an intricate assembly of separate fabric panels buttoned together over linen shifts), the luxurious but unhygienic palaces (Elizabeth got the only "close stool"; most members of her retinue relieved themselves in the courtyards), the huge meals heavily seasoned to disguise the taste of spoiled meat. Against this earthy backdrop, Elizabeth's intelligence and formidable political skills stand in vivid relief. She may have been autocratic, devious, even deceptive, but these traits were required to perform a 45-year tightrope walk between the two great powers of Europe, France and Spain. Both countries were eager to bring small, weak England under their sway and to safely marry off its inconveniently independent queen. Weir emphasizes Elizabeth's precarious position as a ruling woman in a man's world, suggesting plausibly that the single life was personally appealing as well as politically expedient for someone who had seen many ambitious ladies--including her own mother--ruined and even executed for just the appearance of sexual indiscretions. The author's evaluations of such key figures in Elizabeth's reign as the Earl of Leicester (arguably the only man she ever loved) and William Cecil (her most trusted adviser) are equally cogent and respectful of psychological complexity. Weir does a fine job of retelling this always-popular story for a new generation. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Perhaps the most influential sovereign England has ever known, Queen Elizabeth I remained an extremely private person throughout her reign, keeping her own counsel and sharing secrets with no one -- not even her closest, most trusted advisers. Now, in this brilliantly researched, fascinating new book, acclaimed biographer Alison Weir shares provocative new interpretations and fresh insights on this enigmatic figure.<p>Against a lavish backdrop of pageantry and passion, intrigue and war, Weir dispels the myths surrounding Elizabeth I and examines the contradictions of her character.

A practicing Buddhist for over 20 years, he lives with his wife in Quebec and dedicates his time to creating simple and tasty vegan recipes for his website, The Buddhist Chef.Introduction<br><br>The tastes, textures, and aromas of food have fascinated me since I was little. As I was growing up, I found myself wanting to experiment with these elements, so I made sure to be in the kitchen as often as I could. Later, I studied culinary arts, and then spent years working in restaurants of all kinds, where I learned how to perfect my skills. I then set off to Asia in search of adventure, new flavors, and cooking techniques.<br><br>There, I discovered the Buddhist philosophy and its principles of nonviolence. I briefly toyed with the idea of becoming a monk and never coming back home, but the woman whom I would later marry was waiting for me in Canada. When I returned, my interest in Buddhism kept growing. I took part in meditation retreats where I would meditate and work as a chef. Since the meditation centers served food that used no animal products, I found these retreats to be the perfect opportunity to learn how to cook with plants and grains and test out new vegan recipes with a focused yet very willing clientele.<br><br>As time went on, it became more and more difficult for me to continue cooking with meat as part of my job as a chef. My values had changed, and I was miserable working in a system that promoted principles that contradicted my own. One evening, after cooking lamb for 400 guests at a banquet, I realized I could no longer be a part of an industry that took advantage of the weakest beings. I could not go on like this.<br><br>I knew I had to do something&#x2014;but what? Interest in vegan cooking was growing at the time, which was wonderful news for our health, the environment, and the animals, but many people did not know where to begin. My wife then gave me the idea of gathering all the knowledge I had acquired during my culinary career and using it to promote vegan eating. A blog seemed like the perfect venue because readers from all walks of life would be able to find simple, delicious recipes that use no animal products. And that is how The Buddhist Chef was born!<br><br>To this day, I love sharing my recipes with anyone and everyone who wishes to learn how to cook vegan. I try to make veganism accessible and show how simple it is to make a delicious meal using plant-based ingredients you can easily find at your grocery store.<br><br>This cookbook, my first, is my way of helping you to cook vegan simply and flavorfully.<br><br>It contains my &#x201c;classic&#x201d; recipes, the ones my virtual community members appreciate the most. It also features brand-new, fun, and mouthwatering recipes that everyone at your table will love. Whether you are vegan, vegetarian, or simply trying to decrease your meat consumption, I hope you&#x2019;ll enjoy these easy-to-follow and, above all, delicious recipes!</p><h2>The Gone World</h2><p><b>&#x201c;I promise you have never read a story like this.&#x201d;&#x2014;Blake Crouch, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of Dark Matter</b><br><br><b><i>Inception</i> meets <i>True Detective</i> in this science fiction thriller of spellbinding tension and staggering scope that follows a special agent into a savage murder case with grave implications for the fate of mankind...</b><br><br>Shannon Moss is part of a clandestine division within the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. In western Pennsylvania, 1997, she is assigned to solve the murder of a Navy SEAL's family&#x2014;and to locate his vanished teenage daughter. Though she can't share the information with conventional law enforcement, Moss discovers that the missing SEAL was an astronaut aboard the spaceship <i>U.S.S.

He lives in Pittsburgh with his wife and daughter.|&nbsp; One&nbsp; |<br><br> Hello?"<br><br> "Special Agent Shannon Moss?"<br><br> She didn't recognize the man's voice, though she recognized the drawl on the vowels. He'd grown up around here, West Virginia, or Pennsylvania-rural.<br><br> "This is Moss," she said.<br><br> "A family's been killed." A quaver in his voice. "Washington County dispatch logged the 911 a little after midnight. There's a missing girl."<br><br> Two a.m., but the news was like an ice bath. She was fully awake now.<br><br> "Who am I speaking with?"<br><br> "Special Agent Philip Nestor," he said. "FBI."<br><br> She turned on her bedside lamp. Cream-colored wallpaper patterned with vines and cornflower-blue roses covered her bedroom walls. She traced the lines with her eyes, thinking.<br><br> "Why my involvement?" she asked.<br><br> "My understanding's that our SAC communicated with HQ and they instructed him to involve you," said Nestor. "They want NCIS assistance. Our primary is a Navy SEAL."<br><br> "Where?"<br><br> "Canonsburg, on a street called Cricketwood Court, just off Hunter's Creek," he said.<br><br> "Hunting Creek."<br><br> She knew Hunting Creek, Cricketwood Court-her best friend growing up had lived on that street, Courtney Gimm. The image of Courtney's face floated from Moss's memory like ice surfacing through water.<br><br> "How many victims are we dealing with?"<br><br> "Triple homicide," said Nestor. "It's bad. I've never-"<br><br> "Slow down."<br><br> "I'd seen some kids hit by a train once, but nothing like this," he said.<br><br> "Okay," said Moss. "You said the call came in after midnight?"<br><br> "A little later," said Nestor. "A neighbor heard commotion, finally called the police-"<br><br> "Do you have someone speaking with the neighbor?"<br><br> "One of our guys is with her now," he said.<br><br> "I'll make it there in a little over an hour."<br><br> She gained her equilibrium before attempting to stand-her right leg still the lean, muscled leg of an athlete, but her left terminated in a conical mid-thigh stump, the end muscle and flesh there wrapped like a fold-over pastry. She'd lost her leg years ago when she'd been crucified in the deep winter of the Terminus-a transfemoral amputation, the Navy surgeons having cut away the part of her that had gone gangrenous. When she stood, she perched on her single foot like a long-legged shore bird, rocking on the pads of her toes for balance. Her crutches were within reach, Lofstrand crutches she kept propped in the gap between her bed and nightstand. She slipped her forearms through the cuffs and gripped the handles, propelling herself through her bedroom, a cluttered mess of clothes and magazines, loose CDs, empty jewel cases-slipping hazards her occupational therapist had warned her against.<br><br> Cricketwood Court . . .<br><br> A shiver passed over Moss at the thought of returning. She and Courtney had been like sisters through middle school, freshman year-closer than sisters, inseparable. Moss's memories of Courtney were the sweetest essence of childhood summers-endless days spent poolside, roller coasters at Kennywood, splitting cigarettes down by Chartiers Creek. Courtney had died their sophomore year, murdered in a parking lot for the few dollars she'd had in her purse.<br><br> Headline News on the bedroom set while she dressed. She applied antiperspirant to her residual limb, then nestled her polyurethane liner against the blunt edge of her thigh, rolling it to her hip as if she were rolling on a nylon stocking. She smoothed the rubbery sleeve of any air bubbles that might have accrued against her skin. The prosthesis was an Ottobock C-Leg, a prototype-a computerized prosthesis originally designed for wounded soldiers. Moss slid her thigh into the socket and stood, the volume of her thigh forcing out air from the carbon cuff, vacuum-sealing the prosthesis. The C-Leg made her feel as if her skeleton were exposed-a steel shank instead of a shin. She wore slacks, a blouse the color of pearls. She holstered her service weapon. She wore a tailored suede jacket. A last glance at television: Dolly skulking in her hay-strewn pen, Clinton touting the newly signed human-cloning ban, promos for the NBA on NBC, Jordan versus Ewing.<br><br> Cricketwood Court was a cul-de-sac, sirens flaring against row houses and lawns. A quarter after 3:00 a.m., neighbors would know something had happened, but they might not know what yet-if they peered from their windows they would find a confusion of patrol units, sheriff�s cars and Canonsburg PD, state police cruisers, investigations a web of jurisdiction by the time federal agents were involved. Moss�s cases tended to concern Naval Space Command sailors home on shore leave from �Deep Waters,� the black-ops missions to Deep Space and Deep Time. Bar fights, domestic violence, drug charges, homicides. She had worked cases where NSC sailors had snapped and beaten their wives or girlfriends to death-tragic occurrences, some sailors spiraling after seeing the terrors of the Terminus or the light of alien suns. She wondered what she would find here. The county coroner�s van was parked nearby. Ambulances and fire engines idled. The FBI mobile crime lab had backed over the berm into the front lawn of her old friend�s house.<br><br> "Jesus Christ . . ."<br><br> The house Moss remembered from her childhood was as if superimposed over the house as it stood-two films playing concurrently, a memory and a crime scene. Courtney's family had long since moved from here, and Moss never thought she would set foot within her old friend's house again, certainly not under these circumstances. A two-story end unit, the other houses in its row lined up like mirror reflections, each with a driveway, a petite garage, each front stoop lit by a single porch light, the fa ades identical down the line, brick topped by white vinyl. Growing up, Moss had spent more time here than at her own house, it seemed-she still remembered the Gimms' old phone number. An oily sensation of one reality oozing into another, like a yolk pouring through a crack in its shell. She took a swig of coffee from her thermos and rubbed her eyes as if to wake herself, to convince herself that this coincidence of houses was real, that she wasn't caught dreaming. A coincidence, she told herself. There used to be a flowering dogwood in the front yard that had since been hacked down.<br><br> Moss slowed her pickup at a sheriff's blockade, and a deputy approached her window, a middle-aged gut and Chaplinesque mustache that would have been humorous except for the weariness weighing in his eyes. He tried to get her to turn her truck around until she rolled down her window and showed identification.<br><br> "What is that?" he asked.<br><br> "Naval Criminal Investigative Service," she said, accustomed to explaining her agency's initials. "Federal agent. We're interested in a possible military connection. How bad is it?"<br><br> "My buddy was in there earlier and told me this is the worst he's ever seen, just the goddamned worst," he said, his breath stale with coffee. "Says there's not much left of them."<br><br> "Reporters been around?"<br><br> "Not yet," he said. "We were told some news vans are on their way down from Pittsburgh. I don't think they know what they'll find. Quiet otherwise. Come on through."<br><br> A lace of police tape cordoned off the lawn and driveway, stretching from a lamppost and looping around the house's wrought-iron stoop railing. Some of the forensic technicians huddled near the garage, a smoke break. They watched Moss approach without the casual chauvinism or bald stares she sometimes encountered at scenes-their eyes were haunted tonight, glancing her way as if they pitied her for what she was about to endure.<br><br> The doorway was draped with a plastic tarp, but the smells of the house assaulted her once she ducked through, the cloying tang of blood and bright rot and shit mingled with chemical stenches of the techs' solutions, the collection kits and ethanol. The odors seeped into her, a metallic tinge from the blood, her saliva immediately coppery as if she'd sucked on pennies. Criminalists in Tyvek crowded the foyer, busy with evidence preservation, photography. A nervous anticipation roiled Moss in the moments before her first view of a new crime scene; once she turned the corner and saw what she was dealing with, however, her nervousness dissipated, replaced by an urgent and sorrowful compulsion to reassemble the broken pieces as quickly as possible.<br><br> A boy and a woman lay on the floor, their faces smeared away in a mince of brain and blood and whorls of bone. Flannel pants on the boy, a jersey for a nightshirt-ten or eleven years old, Moss guessed. The woman's nightgown was filthy with blood, her bare legs shading to plum where lividity had discolored her. Both had voided their bowels, the floor so sopped that shit and standing blood had pooled in the uneven runnels of the carpeting. The odors gagged her. The smells of the boy and his mother degraded them, she thought, their humanity debased by sewage stink and formlessness.<br><br> Moss had long ago learned the dissociative technique of viewing bodies through different lenses, divorcing the mutilation as much as possible from the personalities they once were-seeing her colleagues around her through the lens of humanity, seeing the bodies through the lens of forensics. Moss objectified the corpses. The kill stroke for the woman had been one of two blows to her head, either to her left zygomatic or to the parietal on the same side. The woman's left pupil had dilated to a wide black saucer. Moss noticed that the boy's fingernails had been removed, all of them. And his toenails, too, it looked like. She checked the woman and found that her nails had been removed as well. Someone-a man, no doubt-had killed these people, then knelt in the gore to pluck their nails from them. Or had he taken their nails before he'd killed them? Why had he done that? One of the technicians ran lengths of thread from the blood spatter on the ceiling and walls, creating a web of thread that delineated an area of convergence-it looked like the victims had been on their knees when they were struck, an execution. The room they had died in was bland, tasteless-nothing like the room Moss had once known, the comfortable, cavelike rec room kept by her best friend's family. Oatmeal tones now, track lighting. Nothing on the walls, no artwork, no photographs; the room didn't look lived in, it looked staged for resale.<br><br> "Shannon Moss?"<br><br> One of the men in Tyvek had paused in his work. Bloodshot eyes, nearly crimson, his dark skin ashen, VapoRub daubed beneath his nostrils in twin greasy streaks.<br><br> "Special agent, NCIS," she said.<br><br> He crossed the living room on stainless-steel risers the investigators used like stepping-stones over the blood. He chewed gum, said, "William Brock, Special Agent in Charge. Let's talk."<br><br> Brock led her through the narrow kitchen, the few men gathered there no longer wearing their Tyvek, their shirts and ties rumpled from hours of work, their faces wan with sleeplessness. Brock, however, seemed tireless-like he would charge bullish until this killer was caught. Angry, almost scowling as he led Moss, as if personally offended by what had happened here. He was sizeable, his voice a resonant baritone in a room of hushed voices.<br><br> "Right through here, in this little den," he said, pulling aside the flimsy accordion door of a room that branched off from the kitchen.<br><br> The rest of the house had been soullessly updated over the years, but the den remained unchanged, seemingly untouched since Moss had seen it last. The effect was unnerving-like this little patch had been forgotten when the rest of time had passed on. Faux-wood paneling, a gaudy light fixture that cast the room in amber. Even the particleboard desk and metal filing cabinets were similar, if not the same pieces left over. Courtney had once found a stash of letters in one of those cabinets that her parents had written as they were divorcing. The girls had sat on the front stoop and read them aloud to each other-Moss struck by how earnest, how almost childish a grown man's letters to his wife could be, nothing different from high-school breakup letters, she'd thought, no difference at all. Nothing changes. The human heart doesn't age.<br><br> "Do we have pictures of the victims?" asked Moss. "Anything recent? It's impossible to tell what they might have looked like."<br><br> "We have some albums," said Brock. "Fotomat receipts and negatives. We'll get them to you once they're developed. Have you had a chance to see the entire scene? Upstairs?"<br><br> "I'll need to see upstairs," said Moss.<br><br> Brock folded closed the accordion door. "I need to talk with you, clear up a few things," he said, taking a seat behind the particleboard desk. "The FBI's deputy director called me in the middle of the night, pulled me from bed. I don't receive calls from him on a regular basis. He told me there's a federal crime scene in Canonsburg, told me to lock it down."<br><br> "But that's not all he told you," said Moss.<br><br> Brock bared his teeth-meant to be a smile, an easing, but it looked like a pained expression. He wadded his gum into its silvery wrapper, replaced it with a fresh black stick. Licorice wafting on a cloud of breath. Moss noticed tooth marks on his pencil-maybe he'd quit smoking, she thought, or was trying to. Early forties, maybe mid-forties, muscular-a regular at the gym, she figured. She imagined him sparring, a boxer. She imagined him running miles on treadmills in empty exercise rooms.<br><br> "I'm struggling to understand what the deputy director told me," said Brock. "To wrap my mind around what we've found here. He briefed me on a Special Access Program called 'Deep Waters.'" Brock spoke the words like an incantation, a shadow of fear passing over his eyes. "A Navy program-a black project. He said our primary suspect, a SEAL named Patrick Mursult, is connected with the Deep Waters program, part of the Naval Space Command. He said to include Shannon Moss in the investigation."<br><br> The scope of the possible world had opened for this man just a few hours ago, thought Moss, seeing Brock struggle to believe the unbelievable. He'd been brought into the secrecy of Deep Waters-but how much had he been trusted with? Moss remembered her first dreamlike glimpse of sunlight glaring off the hulls of the NSC fleet in space, like a spill of diamonds on black velvet-a sublimity few other people have witnessed. She imagined Brock taking the phone call at home, imagined him sitting on the edge of his bed listening to his superior describe what must have sounded like miracles.<br><br> "Mursult was . . . some kind of astronaut," said Brock, his jaw grinding his licorice. "Deep Space-I understand deep space, I can understand we've been farther in the solar system than has been reported, but I don't understand how.

Many have been pulled in by the tractor beam of natural wine--that is, organic or biodynamic wine made with nothing added, and nothing taken away--a movement that has completely rocked the wine industry in recent years. While all of the hippest restaurants and wine bars are touting their natural wine lists, and while more and more consumers are calling for natural wine by name, there is still a lot of confusion about what exactly natural wine is, where to find it, and how to enjoy it. In <i>Natural Wine for the People</i>, James Beard Award-winner Alice Feiring sets the record straight, offering a pithy, accessible guide filled with easy definitions, tips and tricks for sourcing the best wines, whimsical illustrations, a definitive list to the must-know producers and bottlings, and an appendix with the best shops and restaurants specializing in natural wine across the country, making this the must-buy and must-gift wine book of the year.</p><p>ALICE FEIRING is a leading voice in the natural wine movement, and the winner of the James Beard and Louis Roederer Wine Writing Awards. She is the author of seven books, including T<i>he Battle for Wine and Love</i>, <i>Naked Wine</i>, <i>For the Love of Wine</i>, and <i>The Dirty Guide to Wine</i>. In 2013 she was named <i>Imbibe</i> magazine's Wine Person of the Year. Her website The Feiring Line has been an invaluable resource for natural wine enthusiasts since 2004.INTRODUCTION<br><br>The long version of my own short story started with my super sensitive nose. Even as a small child, I suffered ridicule for sniffing everything before eating. This proved to be useful, however, especially when refusing the trout that got everyone else sick, rejecting the quart of milk that was spoiled, and, ultimately, trying to figure out which wines I loved best, so I could drink them before everyone else. More for me.<br><br>My wine drinking started when I was in diapers, sitting in the high chair on Friday nights. It was &#x201c;kiddush&#x201d; wine, Manischewitz mixed with seltzer&#x2014;in other words, plonk. By the time I was cutting classes as a high school senior, I had segued very briefly to a cheap and fizzy Portuguese wine called Lancers, something like the white Zinfandel of its day. I found Riesling in college, stupid cheap and ridiculously aromatic. But when I arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for graduate school, the wine walls fell.<br><br>Those were the late 1970s and early &#x2019;80s. I happened to have a roommate working in the wine business, and we hosted frequent tastings in our apartment. This went on for several years, and during that time, I came to understand that wine tastes much better out of a good glass than a paper cup, that I adored Rh�ne, that I loved wine from the Piedmont even more, and that, quite controversially, Burgundy was fantastic but it wasn&#x2019;t the holy grail. Wine hit me on every single sensual level.<br><br>When, in the 1990s, I moved back to New York City to chase the writing dream, I thought&#x2014;just like any other schnook&#x2014;that because I drank wine I had something to say about it in print. It wasn&#x2019;t until I stumbled onto natural wine that my hunch was anywhere near true.<br><br>Things started to change for me when I noticed a profound shift in the bottle. The hugely influential wine critic Robert Parker Jr. favored big and bold flavors&#x2014;and so, the industry bowed to his tastes. One by one, the Old World, traditionally made wines that I loved, the ones that I had cut my teeth on, were going extinct&#x2014; among them the old Riojas, Barolos, and southern Rh�nes. In their place of nuance were brash imposters, full of fruit and power and oak. Yet, I was able to find some holdouts to write about and some new talent making vibrant wines. These winemakers resisted the market trends and continued to farm organically. They added no ingredients nor made adjustments in the cellar. These wines were exciting and full of life. Without knowing to call them &#x201c;natural,&#x201d; I found new examples of the old wines that had gone missing. It didn&#x2019;t take long to connect the dots. I ate organic foods with no artificial additives, not just because of philosophy but also because they tasted better to me. I barely ate any processed foods; in fact, the most processed food I eat is wonderfully baked bread. In short, I came to drink exactly the way I eat. I came to natural wine because of taste.<br><br>Many years later, the definition of what is &#x201c;natural&#x201d; is debated and challenged. This is such an intense topic that I devote a whole section to it. Yet, I&#x2019;d argue we all know what we&#x2019;re talking about when we talk about <i>natural</i>. Start with organic viticulture. Then, don&#x2019;t add any supplemental grape product, yeast, enzyme, tannin, acid, bacteria, or chemicals, beyond what naturally occurs during the wine-making process.<br><br>In a digital world, analog is needed. In a world where fake dominates, we need real even more&#x2014;hence, the international clamor for more natural wines. When you drink a natural wine, the last sip will be different than the first. Tasting it can be a roller-coaster ride or a tame and well-mannered experience, but usually the best wines will evoke some sort of emotional reaction.<br><br>What once was the provenance of a geeky core of enthusiasts in Paris, New York, Montreal, and Tokyo has crossed into all sorts of uncharted territory, like Detroit, Michigan; Portland, Maine; Houston, Texas; and even very conservative Naples, Florida. No&nbsp;longer niche, this thing called natural wine&#x2014;a return to the way wine was made for centuries&#x2014;has arrived, an overnight sensation that took about forty years.<br><br>What&#x2019;s next? For now, let&#x2019;s indulge in the wines, love them and drink them and celebrate them. However, I believe that natural wine will stop being called &#x201c;natural&#x201d; in a few years and merely will be viewed as wine&#x2014;the only way a wine can be great. The philosophy of the natural wine movement will become ingrained in the way drinkers think and buy wine, much the same way that farm-to-table is just expected, at least in a restaurant of quality. The Big Macs of the world will always exist, but they will not be confused with a healthy meal, the same way that there will be plonk wines and wines. For now, this category has its own heroes, its own methodology. And so, it needs its own little handbook too. Take this book with you to the wine bar, shop, or restaurant, and use it to find the best producers and wines. It will help you select wisely, drink well, learn the language, and understand why these wines have the power to change your life.</p><h2>The Travelling Cat Chronicles</h2><p>RECOMMENDED BY THOUSANDS OF INTERNATIONAL READERS - the tender feelgood story of a man&#39;s journey around Japan with a streetcat.

(Elephant &amp; Piggie Like Reading!)</h2><p>This lyrical beginning-reader by multi award-winning artist Bryan Collier turns the closet on its heel and redefines what it means to be a pair. Beautifully rendered art paired with rich, rhyming dialog creates a powerful reading experience.</p><p>Bryan Collier is an American writer and illustrator known best for illustrating children's books. He won both the Coretta Scott King Award, as illustrator, and the Ezra Jack Keats New Illustrator Award for UPTOWN, the first book he both wrote and illustrated. He has won six King Awards as illustrator and he is a four-time Caldecott honor recipient. For his lifetime contribution as a children's illustrator, Collier was a U.S. nominee for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 2014. <br><br><br>PreS-Gr 1&#x2014; Anthropomorphic shoes clamor to be selected by a girl preparing for a "Daddy-and-Me day!" They are dismayed that she picks a boot and a flip-flop, "You did not choose matching shoes!" The shoes follow her out the door and realize that her choice is okay when they see that her father is wearing two different shoes, too. This tale of love and individuality is peppered with puns: the high-tops say, "That was sneaky!" and the left sneaker says to its mate, "You are right. You are always Right." Elephant says, "OH NO! LEFT LEFT RIGHT!" He laughingly says, "Both the GIRL's and the DAD's shoes did not match!" And Piggie replies, "But they did go together! JUST LIKE US! We make a fun pair." Collier's distinguished art portrays a brown-skinned girl who, throughout the story, bears expressions of contemplation, joy, and finally tentativeness as she greets her father. Dad chips through the ice with his greeting, "Hi, you! Nice shoes!" His brown boot, yellow low-top combo brightens the mood of his daughter, and readers, too. The cast of footwear is expressive, sporting unique eyes&#x2014;flip-flops wear sunglasses, slippers' sleepy eyes are slits, and they all have wry smiles. This is a fabulous addition to the "Elephant and Piggie" series. VERDICT This book is just right for beginning readers and won't be left on the shelf for long.&#x2014; Laura Scott, Farmington Community Library, MI</p><h2>THE Tumtum &amp; Nutmeg: The Rose Cottage Adventures (Tumtum &amp; Nutmeg, 2)</h2><p>Tumtum and Nutmeg just want to live out their comfy lives in peace, unbothered by anything as distracting as an adventure. But the holidays are upon them, and it seems to be the time of year when Arthur and Lucy, the disheveled human children of Rose Cottage, and bumbling veteran hero General Marchmouse are most likely to get into trouble. Tumtum and Nutmeg want to make things right, but first they'll have to outwit a wicked mouse named Purple Claw, face a crazed circus ringmaster, and even save Christmas!<br>In three delightful new adventures, Tumtum and Nutmeg prove that big heroes come in tiny packages.</p><p>Emily Bearn has worked as a staff writer for <i>Harpers &amp; Queen</i> magazine, the <i>Times</i>, and the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>. She lives with her daughter in London, England, where they share their home with two very helpful house mice.Gr 2-5 Tumtum and Nutmeg, two sweet mice, have &#x201c;adopted&#x201d; the children of Rose Cottage. Arthur and Lucy are neglected by their absentminded inventor father, so the mice mend clothes, make home repairs, tidy up, and generally look after their well-being. The three stories in this sequel to Tumtum and Nutmeg (Little, Brown, 2009) follow the mice as they risk their lives to retrieve Christmas gifts for the children from an evil neighboring mouse, attend to them on a seaside holiday replete with treasure maps and more evil mice, and get involved with some nasty circus mice. Their friend General Marchmouse, recently retired, can't resist an adventure, and is always in the thick of both the problems and solutions. There is a redundancy in the story lines and an overreliance on mechanical toys as conveyances; both will likely be overlooked by young readers. From a narrative standpoint, this sequel stands alone, but its foundational matter&#x2013;the whimsical setting and character description&#x2013;are not fully expressed here. Price's pen-and-ink pictures are well-suited to the story.&#x2013;Lisa Egly Lehmuller, St. Patrick's Catholic School, Charlotte, NC. (c) Copyright 2010.

From why the coffee in your cup costs so much to why efficiency is not necessarily the answer to ensuring a fair society, from improving health care to curing crosstown traffic&#x2013;all the dirty little secrets of dollars and cents are delightfully revealed by <i>The Undercover Economist</i>.<br><br>&#x201c;A rare specimen: a book on economics that will enthrall its readers . . . It brings the power of economics to life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Steven D. Levitt, coauthor of <i>Freakonomics<br></i><br>&#x201c;A playful guide to the economics of everyday life, and as such is something of an elder sibling to Steven Levitt&#x2019;s wild child, the hugely successful Freakonomics.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The Economist</i><br><br>&#x201c;A tour de force . . . If you need to be convinced of the everrelevant and fascinating nature of economics, read this insightful and witty book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Jagdish Bhagwati, author of <i>In Defense of Globalization<br></i><br>&#x201c;This is a book to savor.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Harford writes like a dream.

Reading The Undercover Economist is like spending an ordinary day wearing X-ray goggles.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;David Bodanis, author of <i>Electric Universe</i><br><br>&#x201c;Much wit and wisdom.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2013;The Houston Chronicle</i><br>From <i>Publishers Weekly </i><br>Nattily packaged-the cover sports a Roy Lichtensteinesque image of an economist in Dick Tracy garb-and cleverly written, this book applies basic economic theory to such modern phenomena as Starbucks' pricing system and Microsoft's stock values. While the concepts explored are those encountered in Microeconomics 101, Harford gracefully explains abstruse ideas like pricing along the demand curve and game theory using real world examples without relying on graphs or jargon. The book addresses free market economic theory, but Harford is not a complete apologist for capitalism; he shows how companies from Amazon.com to Whole Foods to Starbucks have gouged consumers through guerrilla pricing techniques and explains the high rents in London (it has more to do with agriculture than one might think). Harford comes down soft on Chinese sweatshops, acknowledging "conditions in factories are terrible," but "sweatshops are better than the horrors that came before them, and a step on the road to something better." Perhaps, but Harford doesn't question whether communism or a capitalist-style industrial revolution are the only two choices available in modern economies. That aside, the book is unequaled in its accessibility and ability to show how free market economic forces affect readers' day-to-day.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. <br>From <i>Bookmarks Magazine</i><br>Harford exposes the dark underbelly of capitalism in <i>Undercover Economist</i>. Compared with Steven Levitt&#x2019;s and Stephen J. Dubner&#x2019;s popular <i>Freakonomics </i>(*** July/Aug 2005), the book uses simple, playful examples (written in plain English) to elucidate complex economic theories. Critics agree that the book will grip readers interested in understanding free-market forces but disagree about Harford&#x2019;s approach. Some thought the author mastered the small ideas while keeping in sight the larger context of globalization; others faulted Harford for failing to criticize certain economic theories and to ground his arguments in political, organizational structures. Either way, his case studies&#x2014;some entertaining, others indicative of times to come&#x2014;will make you think twice about that cup of coffee. <br>Copyright � 2004 Phillips &amp; Nelson Media, Inc.</p><p>"The Undercover Economist is a rare specimen: a book on economics that will enthrall its readers. Beautifully written and argued, it brings the power of economics to life. This book should be required reading for every elected official, business leader, and university student." --Steven D. Levitt, author of Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything <p>"Harford writes like a dream--and is also one of the leading economic thinkers of his generation. From his book I found out why there's a Starbucks on every corner, what Bob Geldof needs to learn to make development aid work properly, and how not to get duped in an auction. Reading The Undercover Economist is like spending an ordinary day wearing X-ray goggles." --David Bodanis, author of E=mc2 and Electric Universe </p><p>"If you need to be convinced of the ever-relevant and fascinating nature of economics, read this insightful and witty book by Tim Harford. Using one interesting example after another, The Undercover Economist demonstrates how economic reasoning -- often esoteric and dull, but totally accessible in Harford's hands -- helps illuminate the world around us. Indeed, Harford's book is a tour de force." --Jagdish Bhagwati, author of In Defense of Globalization </p><p>"As Tim Harford demonstrates brilliantly in this enjoyable book, the powerful underlying ideas of economics can, in the hands of the right person, illuminate every aspect of the world we inhabit." --Martin Wolf, Associate Editor and Chief Economics Commentator, Financial Times, and author of Why Globalization Works </p><p>"Most people think economists are boring, opinionated and wrong. Tim Harford is often right, always opinionated, but never boring. He shows how economics can be used to illuminate our everyday lives. Whether you want an explanation of the price of a cup of coffee or of poverty in the third world, Harford has it all." --John Kay, author of Culture and Prosperity: The Truth About Markets</p>Tim Harford is an editorial writer at the<i> Financial Times</i>, where he also writes the newspaper&#x2019;s &#x201c;Dear Economist&#x201d; column and &#x201c;The Undercover Economist&#x201d; column, which also appears in Slate. He lives in London.</p><h2>The Forest Passage</h2><p>Ernst J�nger's <em>The Forest Passage</em> explores the possibility of resistance: how the independent thinker can withstand and oppose the power of the omnipresent state. No matter how extensive the technologies of surveillance become, the forest can shelter the rebel, and the rebel can strike back against tyranny. J�nger's manifesto is a defense of freedom against the pressure to conform to political manipulation and artificial consensus. A response to the European experience under Nazism, Fascism, and Communism, <em>The Forest Passage</em> has lessons equally relevant for today, wherever an imposed uniformity threatens to stifle liberty.<br><br>"In a strikingly poetic political statement written soon after the Second World War, Ernst J�nger rejects the two reigning ideologies, democracy and communism, in favor of an individualistic stance anticipating what we now call libertarianism. The ideal that J�nger projects for us is a metaphorical 'passage through the forest' in which we remain constantly put to the test, with the result that we emerge self-sufficient, rebellious, heroic."<br>--Herbert Lindenberger, Stanford University<br><br>"The Forest Rebel says no to power, outwardly unobtrusive but inwardly rebellious and martial, spiritually, politically, and intellectually, an anarch as opposed to an anarchist. Many of the ideas here reflect Germany's geopolitical situation in the Cold War, powerless against the occupiers of East and West. But the treatise transcends the context in which it was born and manifests J�nger's sharp analysis of trends and problems that are as relevant today as ever. Particularly in the age of the mass plebiscite called the internet and as the marriage of the state and technology has given government unprecedented power over its citizens, a book about how to resist modern forms of tyranny is timely and much needed."<br>--Elliot Neaman, University of San Francisco <br><br>"In the Anglophone world the intellectual and writer Ernst J�nger has been overshadowed by the image of the fierce World War I warrior and the radical right-wing ideologue of the 1920s. The result has been an uneven and one-sided public reception that has severely underestimated the significance and complexity of J�nger's literary oeuvre. Especially his late work has barely been noticed. A critical revision of old approaches is definitely overdue. Therefore the publication of <em>The Forest Passage</em> is a truly important step in the right direction."<br>--Peter Uwe Hohendahl, Cornell University<br><br>"This fascinating work seeks out a place of inner subjective freedom where the besieged citizen of the modern world may withhold consent and refuse participation in the hellish tyranny of administrative totalitarianism. J�nger invites his reader to become a passenger in this forest of thoughtful reflection beyond the reach of political coercion and conformism."<br>--Robert Harrison, Stanford University</p><p>Ernst J�nger (1895 1998) was born in Heidelberg. He served in the German Army during World War I. J�nger s war memoir, <em>Storm of Steel</em>, offers a gripping account of his experiences. He was an outspoken conservative critic of the Weimar Republic. In 1939, J�nger s novel <em>On the Marble Cliffs</em> provided an allegorical critique of Hitler s regime. One of the most controversial writers of twentieth-century Germany, J�nger received many literary prizes. He died at the age of 102.</p><h2>The Way of Orisa: Empowering Your Life Through the Ancient African Religion of Ifa</h2><p>Carried to the Americas by slaves, the 8,000-year-old philosophy of Ifa originated with the Yoruba peoples of West Africa. Ifa's enduring message of strength and inner peace, one that offers a way to harmonize our spiritual and worldly aims, is enjoying a resurgence of popularity in the West. <p>Written by an avid student and accomplished practitioner, <em>The Way of the Orisa</em> provides an exhilarating introduction to the orisa, the powerful messenger spirits who act as our personal guardians. Through fables, rituals, prayers and simple guidelines, Philip Neimark shows how we can further our personal and professional goals by cultivating the loving support of orisa energy. </p><p>Joyous, wise and eminently practical, <em>The Way of the Orisa</em> brings a vibrant ancient tradition to contemporary life.</p></p><p><p>Philip&nbsp;Neimark, an American businessman and publisher, is an Oluwo, or high priest, of Ifa.</p></p><h2>Handbook on the Pentateuch: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy</h2><p>In this introduction to the first five books of the Old Testament, Victor Hamilton moves chapter by chapter through the Pentateuch, examining the content, structure, and theology. Hamilton surveys each major thematic unit of the Pentateuch and offers useful commentary on overarching themes and connections between Old Testament texts.</p><p>"The strengths of Hamilton's revised <i>Handbook on the Pentateuch</i> include its balanced attention to all five books of the Pentateuch, helpful bibliographies, fair-minded exposure to critical debates and competing viewpoints, sustained attention to theological themes and insights, and a clear and readable style. The book functions as a substantive one-volume commentary on the Pentateuch written from a moderate and informed evangelical perspective."<br>--<b>Dennis Olson</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"It is a pleasure to recommend this work as an excellent introduction to the first five books of the Bible. Its sensitivity to the literary structures and emphases in the texts as well as its full awareness of classic and contemporary exegetical issues and scholarship provide an essential tool for introducing students and all interested readers to the fascinating world of the Pentateuch."<br>--<b>Richard S. Hess</b>, Denver Seminary<br><br>"The second edition of Hamilton's <i>Handbook on the Pentateuch</i> follows in the tradition of the first. It is not simply a rehearsal of biblical content but offers concise and scholarly summaries and articulations of modern scholarship on the Pentateuch, while also offering well-crafted, traditional, evangelical positions on many difficult issues that confront readers of the Pentateuch. The bibliographies are remarkable and provide valuable guidance to college and seminary students as they begin their own research."<br>--<b>Peter Enns</b>, Eastern University<br><br>"Hamilton has produced a second edition that is even more helpful for present and future generations of Bible students than the first edition. He has succeeded by revising and expanding the first edition with insights garnered from biblical scholarship at large and from his own study as a biblical commentator and college teacher. The book is brimming with information that exhibits the proper balance of comments on ancient backgrounds, critical theories, and the biblical text."<br>--<b>Kenneth A. Mathews</b>, Beeson Divinity School<br><br>"Hamilton achieves with apparent ease what so many only attempt. He unites historical study with literary insight; he integrates diachronic critical concerns with synchronic, structurally sensitive insights; and he deftly places his own fresh reading of the texts in conversation with an astonishing range of scholarly literature that represents the full spectrum of research on the Pentateuch. All this is done within a sound theological framework that allows the text to be heard naturally as a rule of faith for the church."<br>--<b>Lawson Stone</b>, Asbury Theological Seminary<b>Victor P. Hamilton</b> (PhD, Brandeis University), now retired, was professor of Bible and theology at Asbury University for more than thirty-five years. He is the author of major commentaries on Genesis and Exodus as well as <i>Handbook on the Historical Books.</i></p><h2>NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories</h2><p><b>The candid, hilarious, shocking, occasionally horrifying, and surprisingly moving New York Times bestselling autobiography of punk legends NOFX, their own story in their own words</b><i><br></i><i>NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories</i> is the first tell-all autobiography from one of the world's most influential and controversial punk bands.

It is amazing that from the ashes of all of their lives a band like NOFX could not only rise, but continue to thrive.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Associated Press</i>, 4/27/16</b><br> Punk rock mainstays NOFX have been defying music industry trends for three decades. Now its members can add a new achievement to their unlikely success story: Best-selling authors.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Exclaim!</i>, 4/25/16</b><br> A compelling, often harrowing read.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>NeuFutur</i>, 4/6/16</b><br> Surprisingly sincere Much like the band's music, which buries moments of deep political and emotional topics inside of goofy, often sophomoric humor, the book's emotive moments are buttressed by wild stories about partying on the road Even if you've never been a big fan of NOFX, the book is a refreshing honest look at a struggling independent band dead set on compromising nothing and still managing to be successful.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Bad Feeling Magazine, 5/15/16</b><br> With often unflinching honestly, NOFX have recounted a harrowing story that showcases the real life pain behind the band's often-obnoxious fa�ade.

Like the few great band bios, the array of experiences described in <i>The Hepatitis Bathtub</i> are enough to set anyone into contemplation about strength and perseverance, love and depravity, camaraderie, and a place for misfit rock and rollers in a society that to this day clings to rigid standards. A must-read for punks new and old and an eye-opening read for all new-comers.&#x201d; <b>John Cameron Mitchell</b>, Hedwig and the Angry Inch<br><br> NOFX and Fat Mike are amongst the most powerful influences of my genre.

About having the odds stacked against you, but succeeding nonetheless. About underdogs that end up at the top.&#x201d;<br><b>Chapter 16, 4/20/16</b><br> A tell-all memoir The overarching themes of the book are universal and inspiring, but on a concrete level this memoir is pretty raw Absolute candor is actually what unifies the book and makes it impossible to put down From their humble beginnings in one of the country's toughest punk scenes to superstardom, NOFX never fails to entertain.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Nashville Scene</i>, 4/21/16</b><br> [A] revealing new memoir Staggering and, in some cases, heartbreaking But Hepatitis Bathtub makes it impossible to look the other way The format reads like a sweeping, intriguing conversation, but the book also has a cinematic quality, as each person recalls the same moments in time from his own perspective.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Nashville Tennessean</i>, 4/20/16</b><br> Offers a no-holds-barred look at the band, as the four members Fat Mike' Burkett, Aaron El Jefe' Abeyta, Eric Melvin and Erik Smelly' Sandin share memories from their 30-plus years together.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>Kerrang! </i>, 4/25/16</b><br> Every bit as hilarious, disgusting and boundary-hyphen free as you'd expect from a band who've spent three decades in the punk trenches filling themselves with drugs and booze.&#x201d;<br><b>The A.V.

There's no doubt that, after reading their work of non-fiction, fans will see them in a different light.&#x201d;<br><br><b><i>New Noise</i>, 4/12/16</b><br> The candid demeanor of their stories mirrors the ethics the band have held all along not always pleasant, but a direct reflection of their early DIY roots <i>Hepatitis Bathtub</i> covers it all.

All that is in the past. This is the day you were beginning to believe would never arrive and yet it is here! This is the day you begin to turn your life around. This is the day you commence learning the greatest secrets of success from experts and, more important, how to use what you learn to make a better world for yourself and those you love.<br> &nbsp;<br> Henry David Thoreau once wrote, &#x201c;It is time that we had uncommon schools, that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women.&#x201d; Through the pages of this book you are about to enter an &#x201c;uncommon school,&#x201d; one designed to provide you with valuable information that will fill a large gap in your life and your instructors are, without question, the greatest faculty ever assembled to teach the subject of success and how to achieve it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dale Carnegie, J. Paul Getty, Dr. Maxwell Maltz, Napoleon Hill, P. T. Barnum, Norman Vincent Peale, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer, W. Clement Stone, Dorothea Brande, Richard DeVos, Benjamin Franklin, Lord Beaverbrook, Joyce Brothers&#x2014;these are only some of the fifty brilliant minds who have been gathered together for the first time in history in the fulfillment of a dream I have had for many years&#x2014;to publish the ultimate success book where only the acknowledged masters of that subject were made available to counsel and teach and guide you.<br> &nbsp;<br> Undoubtedly those years you spent in school taught you many things. But during all those hours spent in all those classes, never, not even for a single fifty-minute period, were you taught or shown how to apply what you were learning in order to achieve a life filled with happiness, accomplishment, and success. That is the sole purpose of this book and with your potential we will succeed together.<br> &nbsp;<br> Success! Such a magical word&#x2014;like gold or love or Shangri-la, it conjures up different but always enticing visions in the minds of all of us. Has it been missing from your life? Even if it has, you still daydream don&#x2019;t you, about how wonderful things might be if only fate would smile in your direction and bestow upon you a more generous portion of money, position, power, freedom, and perhaps even a touch of fame?<br> &nbsp;<br> WHY SUCCESS IS SO DIFFICULT<br> &nbsp;<br> We are, each of us, a miracle. Within every one of us, the pilot light of hope never dies. Mechanics, executives, salespeople, students, models, writers, carpenters, computer operators, store owners, entrepreneurs, fruit pickers, stockbrokers, housewives&#x2014;all of us, to some degree, indulge in the same dreams and wishes&#x2014;to be free from want, to live in a finer home, to owe no one, to drive that sleek new automobile, to eat in an elegant restaurant now and then, to vacation in exotic places, to have a few items of designer clothing in our wardrobe, to send our children to the best of schools.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why not? Haven&#x2019;t we been told, since birth, that we live in a land of unlimited opportunity?<br> &nbsp;<br> Why not? The answer is obvious, but painful. The vast majority of us have absolutely no idea how to begin to make our dreams come true! Undoubtedly you already have all the tools necessary to create a magnificent life, but what good are they&nbsp;...&nbsp;if you don&#x2019;t know how to use them? And how can you build a life worth living without any plans or blueprints?<br> &nbsp;<br> Not once&#x2014;neither in primary school nor junior high school nor high school, not even in the most hallowed halls of higher learning&#x2014;were you ever instructed on the simple techniques of setting goals, of motivating yourself and others, of dealing with adversity, of eliminating self-defeating habits, of using time profitably, of practicing the power of choice, of developing self-confidence, of doing the things you are afraid to do, of generating enthusiasm at will, of organizing your life, of accumulating wealth, of getting people to give you what you want, of looking like a winner, of guiding your children, of handling stress, of counting your blessings&nbsp;...&nbsp;and so much more. That you have managed to survive at all is a tribute to your courage and faith.<br> &nbsp;<br> And yet, though we hang on, our shortcomings haunt us. We are made vividly and painfully aware of them every time we turn on a television set or pick up a newspaper or magazine. Bravely we try to ignore the affluence and success of so many others but we are forced to admit, if only in our darkest moments of introspection, that Hendrik van Loon was correct when he wrote, &#x201c;In history as in life, it is success that counts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Well&#x2014;is it too late for you to reach for that brass ring or make a run for the roses? Should you crawl into your dusty little corner of self-pity and just let the world pass you by? No! Never!<br> &nbsp;<br> YOUR GREATEST ASSET<br> &nbsp;<br> Let us take inventory. Did you possibly learn anything during those formative years of schooling that might help you to change your life for the better, if you were to begin today, regardless of your age, your skills, your background, your color, your financial condition, or your opinion of yourself? Just one thing, if you stop to think about it and that one thing may be all you need!<br> &nbsp;<br> Listen carefully as the great English essayist, historian, biographer, and philosopher, Thomas Carlyle, explains.<br> &nbsp;<br> If we think about it, all that a university or final highest school can do for us, is still but what the first school began doing&#x2014;teach us to read. We learn to read in various languages, in various sciences; we learn the alphabet and letters of all manners of books. But the place where we are to get knowledge, even theoretic knowledge, is the books themselves. It depends on what we read, after all manners of professors have done their best for us. The true university of these days is a collection of books!<br> &nbsp;<br> According to Carlyle&#x2019;s specifications this volume you are holding is a &#x201c;university of success&#x201d; since it contains a choice collection of the wisdom, techniques, and principles from the greatest books in the world of success literature. Here you will discover nuggets of pure gold, waiting only for you to reach out and claim them as your own. Here you will be taught by men and women whose messages have withstood the tests of time and practicality and whose principles work.<br> &nbsp;<br> Please remember, you need not accept or attempt to use all of the hundreds of success ideas and techniques you are about to learn. Just one may be all you need to work wonders in your life and career. All that is required of you, in this place of learning, is an ability to read plus&#x2014;a burning desire to make something more of your life. And don&#x2019;t even be too concerned if the flames of that desire give off little heat as you begin your studies. Their temperature will rise, gradually, as you begin to realize how much you can still accomplish in the years ahead.<br> &nbsp;<br> HOW TO GET THE MOST FROM THIS BOOK<br> &nbsp;<br> Read it from beginning to end. Do not skip any of the lessons. They were arranged in the order they are presented, after much deliberation, in order to assist you in making a gradual transition from the person you are today to the person you can become.<br> &nbsp;<br> Because you are about to be exposed to a wealth of knowledge, it might be easier for you to assimilate if you take it in small bites. For maximum effect I would suggest that you read only one lesson each day, and try to make that reading as close to your bedtime as possible. Marvelous things happen when you put your subconscious mind to work, and when you awake you will be amazed at how much of the material you have retained. Don&#x2019;t hurry. You will be guided patiently through eight semesters, as in a normal university career, plus two additional semesters of graduate work so that you will even be able to cope with success, once you have it.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you are a woman, an overemphasis of the masculine tense in a few of the lessons may disturb you. Don&#x2019;t let that prevent you from extracting the good in each. Usually those particular segments were written long before the happy emancipation that has taken place in the second half of this century. Just remind yourself that the bias, if it shows at all, was an innocent product of another age. Success is no longer restricted, thank God, to either gender.<br> &nbsp;<br> One more thing. Avoid, if at all possible, falling into the trap of reading this book in the same casual manner that you might read most volumes of fiction or even nonfiction. Your teachers are all highly motivated and dynamic individuals and there is an ever-present danger that you may become fascinated by their personalities, delivery, and charm, enjoy their words as entertainment, and forget that your main purpose for being here, attending these lectures, is to acquire the tools necessary for success.<br> &nbsp;<br> How do you avoid this danger? Simple. Whenever you open this book, be certain that you have a pen or pencil in your hand. When you read a line or paragraph that is meaningful to you&#x2014;underline it! This simple act, alone, will triple your retention of that thought or principle and also make it easier for you to find it again, later on. You might also wish to draw a star next to certain powerful suggestions or methods that catch your fancy, or an exclamation mark, or a question mark if you don&#x2019;t agree. After all, this is your own personal textbook for a brighter tomorrow.<br> &nbsp;<br> IT&#x2019;S ALL UP TO YOU<br> &nbsp;<br> Unlike most higher schools of learning, this university will have no graduation ceremonies, no diplomas signifying you have survived the system, nor will there be any final exams or degrees conferred. The only reward you will receive, because of your efforts here, will be how much you manage to change your life for the better&#x2014;in terms of peace and contentment and pride as well as material gain.<br> &nbsp;<br> History is filled with stories of individuals who dated a new era in their lives from the reading of a single book. May your name eventually be added to that already impressive and glorious list. But&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all up to you. No one else can live your life for you. No one else can succeed for you!<br> It&#x2019;s your move.<br> &nbsp;<br> Og Mandino&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Anatomy of the Moving Body, Second Edition: A Basic Course in Bones, Muscles, and Joints</h2><p>Learning anatomy requires more than pictures and labels; it requires a way "into" the subject, a means of making sense of what is being shown. <i>Anatomy of the Moving Body</i> addresses that need with a simple yet complete study of the body's complex system of bones, muscles, and joints and how they function. Beautifully illustrated with more than 100 3D images, the book contains 31 lectures that guide readers through this challenging interior landscape. Each part of the body is explained in brief, manageable sections, with components described singly or in small groups. The author doesn&#x2019;t just name the muscles and bones but explains the terminology in lay language. Topics include the etymology of anatomical terms; origins and attachments of muscles and their related actions; discussion of major functional systems such as the pelvis, ankle, shoulder girdle, and hand; major landmarks and human topography; and structures relating to breathing and vocalization. This second edition features all-new illustrations that use a 3D digital model of the human anatomical form. The book's thoroughness, visual interest, and clear style make it ideal for students and teachers of the Alexander and Feldenkrais techniques as well as for practitioners of yoga, Pilates, martial arts, and dance.</p><p>Ted Dimon is director of the Dimon Institute, a center for the study of movement and performance. He received his master&#x2019;s and doctorate degrees from Harvard University and has taught and trained teachers in the Alexander Technique for 25 years. He lives in New York City.&#x201c;More than just clear, concise, and accurate, Dimon&#x2019;s <i>Anatomy of the Moving Body</i> also wonderfully expresses the joy of musculoskeletal anatomic understanding&#x2014;its marvelous vocabulary and endlessly fascinating relations of structure and function.&#x201d;&#x2014;John H. M. Austin, MD, Professor of Radiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University&#x201c;<i>Anatomy of the Moving Body</i> is a superb work for students and teachers. Ted Dimon&#x2019;s work is straightforwardly written, beautifully illustrated, and put forth with a sensibility of one who understands not simply how we are organized, but how our structure is able to move with grace and beauty. The conversational tone makes the book accessible and the information is conveyed with a sense not only of where things lie, but how they can operate most harmoniously. This book is an important contribution to our understanding of anatomy and an essential part of the training of those of us who are interested in the human form in balance, health, and motion.&#x201d;&#x2014;Anne Bluethenthal, Dancer, Teacher, Choreographer</p><h2>The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers Omnibus</h2><p>All the Freak Brothers stories, book covers, posters and merchandise collected together in one big volume. Includes a share certificate offer for the upcoming animated movie. The definitive Freak Brothers book for years to come.</p><p><b>Gilbert Shelton</b>, born in Dallas in 1940. At university in Austin he became editor of the student magazine,<i> The Texas Ranger</i>. This was to prove Shelton&#x2019;s last &#x2018;real job&#x2019;. For in 1967, after contributing to various underground comix with his earliest character, Wonder Wart-Hog, and designing posters for rock concerts, Shelton created The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. In 1969 he and some friends from Texas moved to San Francisco to set up Rip Off Press from where Freak Brothers strips were soon syndicated, borrowed (or stolen!) by a host of American underground newspapers and magazines. The first collection was published in 1971 and has since been joined by thirteen further Freak Brothers adventures. Fat Freddy&#x2019;s Cat, the feline world&#x2019;s number one cat, started out as a footnote strip to the Freak Brothers but has led an independent &#x2013; and very successful &#x2013; life since 1975. In 1993 Shelton introduced new characters, Not Quite Dead, the world&#x2019;s least successful Rock Band who have since appeared in a series of comics of their own. Now 50 years later and unlike many cults from the sixties which have faded away, The Freak Brothers are still going from strength to strength. They are published in 15 languages and worldwide sales are now over 40 million copies plus millions of items of merchandise, T-shirts, postcards, badges, posters and more. Shelton currently lives in Paris, France with his wife and three cats.First rearing its shaggy head during the thick of the psychedelic era, Sheltons classic series could be cited as the Big Bang of stoner humor as we now understand the genre, predating Cheech &amp; Chong's THC-based antics and stoner humor in general by a few years. Differing from much of the mean-spirited material found in the nascent underground genre by being legitimately funny, the Freak Brothers slacked their way from one misadventure to another, getting ripped off by dealers, avoiding work and staying as completely stoned as possible. Fat Freddy, Phineas and Freewheelin Franklins existence reads like a pothead sitcom, the characters world defined first in a series of short stories, and longer, even epic tales allow Shelton to run wild as the gags fly fast and furious. This massive 40th anniversary omnibus edition collects the entirety of the series, and as Shelton so famously observed, Dope will get you through times of no money better than money will get you through times of no dope, so in these financially uncertain times its a downright steal for its price. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

And it turns out the whimper can be a lot harder to cope with. The Earth's rotation slows, gradually stretching out days and nights and subtly affecting the planet's gravity. The looming apocalypse parallels the adolescent struggles of 10-year-old Julia, as her comfortable suburban life succumbs to a sort of domestic deterioration. Julia confronts her parents' faltering marriage, illness, the death of a loved one, her first love, and her first heartbreak. Karen Thompson Walker is a gifted storyteller. Her language is precise and poetic, but style never overpowers the realism she imbues to her characters and the slowing Earth they inhabit. Most impressively, Thompson Walker has written a coming-of-age tale that asks whether it's worth coming of age at all in a world that might end at any minute. Like the best stories about the end of the world, <em>The Age of Miracles</em> is about the existence of hope and whether it can prevail in the face of uncertainty. --<em>Kevin Nguyen</em></p> <p><b>Q&amp;A with Karen Thompson Walker</b></p> <p><strong>Q. In <em>The Age of Miracles, </em>you envision a natural phenomenon that threatens the entire world. This "slowing" is global, yet you decided to focus on Julia. Why?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>Julia's voice--the voice of a young woman looking back on her adolescence--came into my head as soon as I had the idea of the slowing. It was the only way I could imagine writing the book. Adolescence is an extraordinary time of life, a period when the simple passage of time results in dramatic consequences, when we grow and change at seemingly impossible speeds. It seemed natural to tell the story of the slowing, which is partly about time, in the context of middle school. It was also a way of concentrating on the fine-grain details of everyday life, which was very important to me. I was interested in exploring the ways in which life carries on, even in the face of profound uncertainty.</p> <p>Julia felt like a natural narrator for this story because she listens more than she speaks, and she watches more than she acts. I think the fact that Julia is an only child is part of why she's so observant. Julia also places a very high value on her friendships, and is unusually attuned to the subtle tensions in her parents' marriage, which increase as the slowing unfolds.</p> <p><strong>Q. The details of how such a slowing would affect us and our environment are rendered quite realistically. How did you get these details right? </strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>No one knows exactly what would happen if the rotation of the earth slowed the way it does in my book, so I had some freedom. I did some research at the outset, but I came across many of my favorite details accidentally. Whenever I read an article that contained a potentially relevant detail--anything from sleep disorders, to new technologies for growing plants in greenhouses, to the various ways people and governments reacted to the financial crisis--I would knit it into the fabric of the book. After I finished the book, I had an astrophysicist read it for scientific accuracy, which was an extremely nerve-racking experience. I was relieved by how many of my details he found plausible, but made some adjustments based on what he said.</p> <p>In general, I wanted my book to seem as real as possible. I recently read a <em>Guardian</em> interview with the Portuguese writer Jos� Saramago, who said that his books were about "the possibility of the impossible." He explained that even if the premise of a book seemed "impossible," it was important to him that the development of that premise be logical and rational. That's exactly the way I wanted <em>The Age of Miracles</em> to function.</p> <p><strong>Q. Like Julia, you grew up in Southern California, where natural disasters are always looming. Do you think this influenced you in writing of <em>The Age of Miracles</em>?</strong></p> <p><strong>A. </strong>I grew up in San Diego on a cul-de-sac of tract houses much like the one where <em>The Age of Miracles</em> takes place. In most ways, California was a very pleasant place to grow up. But it could also be a little scary. I remember how the sky would sometimes fill with smoke during fire season, how the smoke hung in the air for days at a time, burning our throats and turning everything slightly orange. I remember the way the windows rattled at the start of every earthquake, and the way the chandelier above our dinner table would swing back and forth until the shaking stopped. I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, worried that an earthquake or a fire would strike at night. But when I think of those years now, I realize that my novel grew partly out of my lifelong habit of imagining disaster.</p> <p>If I've given the impression that I was constantly afraid as a child, that's not right. In fact, one of the things I remember most vividly about living in California is the way we mostly ignored the possibility of danger. We always knew that the "big one"--the giant earthquake that scientists believe will one day hit the region--could strike at any time, but mostly we lived as if it never would. Life often felt idyllic: We played soccer, we went swimming, we went walking on the beach. A little bit of denial is part of what it means to live in California. Then again, maybe that's also just part of being alive. I really wanted to capture that feeling in <em>The Age of Miracles.</em></p><p><b>Karen Thompson Walker</b> is the author of<i> The Age of Miracles</i>, which was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.

His mentor and great aunt, Catherine Peck, was well versed in Depression-Era foods. As a naturalist for the Environmental Nature Center (Newport Beach, CA) in the late 1980s he developed a deep respect for native crafting, eating and living. Since then his love of foraging, gardening and California&#x2019;s landscapes have wildly grown. Doug has been working in and grazing California&#x2019;s gardens for over 40 years. He has worked on hundreds of landscapes projects throughout the state. He has two advanced degrees in ecological land management. He has volunteered to restoration and urban food efforts in numerous communities. He has taught some aspect of foraging and/or wildcrafting at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, since 2008. And Doug has written 6 other books on environmental horticulture. For some people foraging is about survival, to others it is about a spiritual connection with the land. To Doug, foraging is about everyday wellbeing and delight. He believes that California would be far healthier and resilient if we would embrace our nature and graze our impact and weeds.<p><b>Mustard</b><br> <i>(Brassica</i> spp.) </p><p></p><ul><li><b>Type:</b> Semi-woody fleshy annual</li> <li><b>Status:</b> Non-native</li> <li><b>Leaf Arrangement:</b> Basal growth when young; alternate when on a stalk</li> <li><b>Harvest Time:</b> From the first rain until the area dries out: typically midsummer</li></ul> <p><b>Habitat:</b> Mustard is a car-follower and can be found nearly everywhere. The taller varieties, like black mustard (<i>Brassica nigra</i>), are found closer to the ocean; the lower-growing varieties, such as common mustard (<i>Brassica tournefortii</i>) are found in the desert. </p><p><b>Growth:</b> Mustard&#x2019;s rich deep green leaves, tall flower spikes, and pungent smell make identification easy&#x2015;tear a leaf, take a whiff, and if it smells like mustard, then it is. The stalks of mustard grow between 1 and 5 feet tall. This group of plants includes one of California&#x2019;s most iconic weeds: black mustard.&nbsp; </p><p><b>Leaves:</b> Mustard leaves vary greatly, even on a single plant. Leaves of an emerging plant form at its base and are large, oblong, and deeply lobed and slightly serrated. As the stalk grows, leaves become narrower and toothed, with some leaves having smooth edges, while others are slightly serrated.&nbsp; </p><p><b>Flowers:</b> The bright yellow flowers grow from short stems that are whorled around a central stalk (raceme). The stems get shorter as the stalk gets taller. Each small flower has four petals. Most bloom from March to August. </p><p><b>Seeds Pods:</b> Seeds are about 1 inch long, needle-like, and typically point upwards. </p><p><b>Season:</b> Found from November to when the plants start dying back, which might be as late as September. Younger leaves are easier to chew and enjoy; older leaves are fibrous and tough (but no less beneficial). </p><p><b>Benefits:</b> Mustard is a superfood. Very high in fiber and vitamins A, C, and K, it&#x2019;s also high in calcium, folate, iron, manganese, potassium, and vitamins B6 and E. And it has some fatty acids, protein, and phosphorus. It helps reduce inflammation, promotes liver health, lowers cholesterol, and aids in bone building. Its seeds and flowers are also edible. </p><p><b>Other Names:</b> Black mustard, Mediterranean cabbage, rapeseed </p><p><b>Comparable Species:</b> Many plants have flowers that look similar. These include yellow rocket (<i>Barbarea</i> spp.), wallflower (<i>Erysimum</i> spp.), hedge mustard (<i>Sisymbrium officinale</i>), and London rocket (<i>Sisymbrium</i> spp., page 72). The leaves of yellow rocket and hedge mustard look somewhat similar too. The best way to identify it is to tear a leaf and smell it&#x2015;only mustard has that distinct mustard smell. </p><p><b>Notes:</b> You can eat the leaves raw or cooked. It is healthiest to pick the lower leaves. Young plants are more palatable than older specimens. Every member of Brassica is edible.</p></p><h2>Dearly Devoted Dexter</h2><p>Life&#x2019;s tough for Dexter Morgan. It&#x2019;s not easy being the world&#x2019;s only serial killer with a conscience, especially when you work for the Miami police. To avoid suspicion, Dexter&#x2019;s had to slip deep into his disguise: spending time with his girlfriend and her kids, slowly becoming the world&#x2019;s first serial killing couch potato. Then a particularly nasty psychopath starts cutting a trail through Miami &#x2014; a killer whose twisted techniques leave even Dexter speechless. When his sister Deborah, a tough-as-nails cop, is drawn into the case, it becomes clear that Dexter will have to do come out of hiding and hunt the monster down.

It's just not easy being an ethical serial killer--especially while trying to avoid the unshakable suspicions of the dangerous Sergeant Doakes (who believes Dexter is a homicidal maniac . . . which, of course, he is). In an attempt to throw Doakes off his trail, Dexter has had to slip deep into his foolproof disguise. While not working as a blood-spatter analyst for the Miami Police Department, he now spends nearly all his time with his cheerful girlfriend, Rita, and her two children, sipping light beer and slowly becoming the world's first serial couch potato. But how long can Dexter play Kick the Can instead of Slice the Slasher? How long before his Dark Passenger forces him to drop the charade and let his inner monster run free?<br>In trying times, opportunity knocks. A particularly nasty psychopath is cutting a trail through Miami--a man whose twisted technique leaves even Dexter speechless. As Dexter's dark appetite is revived, his sister, Deborah (a newly minted, tough-as-nails Miami detective) is drawn headlong into the case. It quickly becomes clear that it will take a monster to catch a monster--but it isn't until his archnemesis is abducted that Dex can finally throw himself into the search for a new plaything. Unless, of course, his plaything finds him first . . . <br>With the incredible wit and freshness that drew widespread acclaim to "Darkly Dreaming Dexter, Jeff Lindsay now takes Dexter Morgan to a new level of macabre appeal and gives us one of the most original, colorful narrators in years."<br></p>JEFF LINDSAY is the author of <i>Darkly Dreaming Dexter</i>.

Skeletons of these supposed saints were subsequently sent to Catholic churches and religious houses in German-speaking Europe to replace holy relics that had been destroyed in the wake of the Protestant Reformation. The skeletons, known as &#x201c;the catacomb saints,&#x201d; were carefully reassembled, richly dressed in fantastic costumes, wigs, crowns, jewels, and armor, and posed in elaborate displays inside churches and shrines as reminders to the faithful of the heavenly treasures that awaited them after death.</p> Paul Koudounaris gained unprecedented access to religious institutions to reveal these fascinating historical artifacts.

Sensing a kindred spirit in the plucky young bird, Mozart bought him and took him home to be a family pet. For three years, the starling lived with Mozart, influencing his work and serving as his companion, distraction, consolation, and muse.<br>Two centuries later, starlings are reviled by even the most compassionate conservationists. A nonnative, invasive species, they invade sensitive habitats, outcompete local birds for nest sites and food, and decimate crops. A seasoned birder and naturalist, Lyanda Lynn Haupt is well versed in the difficult and often strained relationships these birds have with other species and the environment. But after rescuing a baby starling of her own, Haupt found herself enchanted by the same intelligence and playful spirit that had so charmed her favorite composer.<br>In <i>Mozart's Starling</i>, Haupt explores the unlikely and remarkable bond between one of history's most cherished composers and one of earth's most common birds. The intertwined stories of Mozart's beloved pet and Haupt's own starling provide an unexpected window into human-animal friendships, music, the secret world of starlings, and the nature of creative inspiration. A blend of natural history, biography, and memoir, <i>Mozart's Starling</i> is a tour de force that awakens a surprising new awareness of our place in the world.<br></p><p>Lyanda Lynn Haupt is an ecophilosopher, naturalist, and author of several books, including <i>The Urban Bestiary</i>, <i>Crow Planet</i>, <i>Pilgrim on the Great Bird Continent</i>, and<i> Rare Encounters with Ordinary Birds</i>. A winner of the Washington State Book Award and the Sigurd F. Olson Nature Writing Award, she lives in Seattle with her husband and daughter."This hard-to-put-down, charming blend of science, biography, and memoir illuminating the little-known story of the composer and his beloved bird is enlivened by the immediacy of Haupt's tales of Carmen, and brimming with starling information, travelogues, and historical details about Mozart's Vienna."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist (Starred Review)</i></i></b><br><br>"Weaving together cheerful memoir, natural history, and biography, the author celebrates her 'insatiably social' pet starling, Carmen; investigates Mozart's experience with his avian companion... and offers intriguing details about starling behavior."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Stories of [Carmen's] upbringing interspersed with details about Mozart, his family and career are both delightful and interesting."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Seattle Times</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Charming and highly readable."&#x2015;<b><i><i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i><br></i></b><br><br>"<i>Mozart's Starling</i> is a delightful, enlightening, breathless flight through the worlds of Carmen and Star, two European starlings who join their human counterparts in exploring life and music and nature, helping to shed light on the connection between humans and birds -- those of us bound to terra firma, and those who are free to soar."&#x2015;<b><i>Garth Stein, author of <i>The Art of Racing in the Rain</i> and <i>A Sudden Light</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>Mozart's Starling</i> sparkles with imagination, emotion, and insight. Common birds, who too many consider vermin, have great gifts to share. Thank you, Lyanda Lynn Haupt, for showing us the delight and magic of a starling."&#x2015;<b><i>Sy Montgomery, author of <i>Birdology</i> and <i>The Soul of an Octopus</i></i></b><br><br>"Lyanda Lynn Haupt raised a starling of her own to see if the tale of Mozart and his starling could be true. Her experience brings the legend of musician and bird into our present world where science rules. Yet even today, the song of the starling, but a minute in length, lies at the very limits of human comprehension. Read the book and you will learn why."&#x2015;<b><i>David Rothenberg, author of <i>Why Birds Sing </i>and <i>Survival of the Beautiful</i></i></b><br><br>"A brave thing it is to write a love-song to starlings, in a conservation culture inclined not only to struggle with exotic species, but to demonize them. But Lyanda Haupt has done just that--not as apologist for wildlings in North America, but as celebrant of an utterly extraordinary, beautiful, and deeply engaging animal in and of itself. In prose as lovely as birdsong and as clear and sharp as the cool air itself, she has given starlings--hers, Mozart's, the whole species--the kind of loving and rigorous Life that every kind of creature deserves but very few get. I thought of Gerald Durrell, Konrad Lorenz, and Jane Goodall, none of whom I loved reading more. The story of Carmen, Star, and their humans is as riveting as a good novel, and I learned as much about Mozart as about birdsong and birdbrains. I enjoyed <i>Mozart's Starling</i> immensely, and I challenge anyone to read it and still treat starlings inhumanely. Lucky is the bird that finds its Papagena."&#x2015;<b><i>Robert Michael Pyle, author of <i>Through a Green Lens</i> and <i>Mariposa Road</i></i></b><br><br>"By raising up her own pet starling, Lyanda Lynn Haupt reveals something that music historians have missed -- how daily life with a bird impacted Mozart during his most productive period. By sharing this delightful tale with the rest of us, she also reveals the unexpected quirks and charms of a species too often dismissed as a pest.<i> Mozart's Starling</i> is pure pleasure."&#x2015;<b><i>Thor Hanson, author of <i>The Triumph of Seeds</i></i></b><br><br>"Haupt's is an informative and entertaining book of a well-versed ornithologist/ naturalist who adopted a five-day old starling chick into the family. Starlings are well known for their vocal ingenuity that had entranced not only Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but also biologists and linguists. The bird that had entranced Mozart entranced Haupt as well, and in part for the same reasons. Starlings and humans are both highly social and vocal, providing an opportunity for mutual bonding and cross-species communication. Indeed, there is debate whether Mozart was influenced by his starling or vice versa. Haupt's adventure with the starling that became a companion and bond-mate prompted a classic adventure into the nature of the bird, music, and Mozart's relationships. This highly readable account is a success at several levels, and is bound to become a classic."&#x2015;<b><i>Bernd Heinrich, author of <i>Mind of the Raven</i> and <i>One Wild Bird at a Time</i></i></b></p><h2>Meditations on Violence: A Comparison of Martial Arts Training and Real World Violence</h2><p><strong>ForeWord's Book of the Year Award FINALIST - 2008<br></strong><strong>USA Best Book Award FINALIST - 2008<br></strong>A Comparison of Martial Arts Training &amp; Real-World Violence <br><br>Experienced martial artist and veteran correction officer Sgt.

Christensen, the author of such business classics as <em>The Innovator&#x2019;s Dilemma</em> and the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>How Will You Measure Your Life</em>, and co-authors Efosa Ojomo and Karen Dillon reveal why so many investments in economic development fail to generate sustainable prosperity, and offers a groundbreaking solution for true and lasting change.<br><br>Global poverty is one of the world&#x2019;s most vexing problems. For decades, we&#x2019;ve assumed smart, well-intentioned people will eventually be able to change the economic trajectory of poor countries. From education to healthcare, infrastructure to eradicating corruption, too many solutions rely on trial and error. Essentially, the plan is often to identify areas that need help, flood them with resources, and hope to see change over time.</p><p>But hope is not an effective strategy.</p><p>Clayton M. Christensen and his co-authors reveal a paradox at the heart of our approach to solving poverty. While noble, our current solutions are not producing consistent results, and in some cases, have exacerbated the problem. At least twenty countries that have received billions of dollars&#x2019; worth of aid are poorer now.</p><p>Applying the rigorous and theory-driven analysis he is known for, Christensen suggests a better way. The right kind of innovation not only builds companies&#x2014;but also builds countries. <em>The Prosperity Paradox</em> identifies the limits of common economic development models, which tend to be top-down efforts, and offers a new framework for economic growth based on entrepreneurship and market-creating innovation. Christensen, Ojomo, and Dillon use successful examples from America&#x2019;s own economic development, including Ford, Eastman Kodak, and Singer Sewing Machines, and shows how similar models have worked in other regions such as Japan, South Korea, Nigeria, Rwanda, India, Argentina, and Mexico.</p><p>The ideas in this book will help companies desperate for real, long-term growth see actual, sustainable progress where they&#x2019;ve failed before. But <em>The Prosperity Paradox</em> is more than a business book; it is a call to action for anyone who wants a fresh take for making the world a better and more prosperous place.</p></p><p><p>Resolving the Paradox</p><p>Starving children on street corners. Slums without adequate clean water and sanitation. Hopeless prospects for employment amid a growing youth population. Most of us are moved by the painful signs of poverty we see in poor countries all around the world. Though some progress has been made, upwards of 750 million people still live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day. We all want to help. But what might seem to be the most obvious solution to these problems&#x2014;directly assisting poor countries by investing to fix these visible signs of poverty&#x2014;has not been as successful as many of us would like. You only have to look at the billions of dollars that have been channeled to these problems over the years with relatively slow progress to conclude that something is not quite right. With these efforts, we may be easing poverty for some&#x2014;but we&#x2019;re not moving the needle enough long term.</p><p>What if we considered this problem through a different lens? What if, instead of trying to fix the visible signs of poverty, we focused instead on creating lasting prosperity? This may require a counterintuitive approach to economic development, but one that will cause you to see opportunities where you might least expect them. We wrote this book to celebrate the role innovation can play, even in the most difficult of circumstances, in creating and sustaining prosperity even in some of the most desperate parts of the world. By supporting and investing in market-creating innovations, we inadvertently engage in nation building. </p>CLAYTON M. CHRISTENSEN&nbsp;is the Kim B.

They managed their territories as business interests, treating their subjects as employees, customers, or competitors. The leaders of these trading enterprises exercised virtually unaccountable, dictatorial political power over millions of people.</p><p>The merchant kings of the Age of Heroic Commerce were a rogue's gallery of larger-than-life men who, for a couple hundred years, expanded their far-flung commercial enterprises over a sizable portion of the world. They include Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the violent and autocratic pioneer of the Dutch East India Company; Peter Stuyvesant, the one-legged governor of the Dutch West India Company, whose narrow-minded approach lost Manhattan to the British; Robert Clive, who rose from company clerk to become head of the British East India Company and one of the wealthiest men in Britain; Alexandr Baranov of the Russian American Company; Cecil Rhodes, founder of De Beers and Rhodesia; and George Simpson, the "Little Emperor" of the Hudson's Bay Company, who was chauffeured about his vast fur domain in a giant canoe, exhorting his voyageurs to paddle harder so he could set speed records.<br><i>Merchant Kings</i> looks at the rise and fall of company rule in the centuries before colonialism, when nations belatedly assumed responsibility for their commercial enterprises.

The heady, sweet scent of flowering nutmeg trees filled the humid air. The commander of the squadron, one of the largest corporate fleets yet to depart the Netherlands for &#x201c;the spiceries,&#x201d; was Admiral Pieter Verhoeven (Peter Verhoef), a veteran not of trade and exploration but of combat at sea. He was now employed by the Dutch East India Company, the VOC (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie), with the objective of securing for his employers the exotic cloves and nutmeg of the Moluccas, as the &#x201c;Spice Islands&#x201d; of Indonesia were then known. The admiral commanded more than a thousand fighting men, including a contingent of Japanese mercenaries, and his orders from the &#x201c;Heeren XVII&#x201d; (the Lords Seventeen), his powerful corporate directors in the Netherlands, were direct and clear: &#x201c;We draw your special attention to the islands in which grow the cloves and nutmeg, and we instruct you to strive after winning them for the company either by treaty or by force.&#x201d; Force was something Verhoef understood well, having earned distinction at the Battle of Gibraltar two years earlier, when Dutch ships virtually wiped out a mighty fleet of Holland&#x2019;s bitter enemy, Imperial Spain.</p> <p>As Verhoef and his fleet neared the principal harbour of Great Banda, the admiral was astonished and annoyed to spy an English ship in the sheltered port. For several years now, the Dutch East India Company had been engaged in a simmering conflict with the traders and merchants of the English East India Company. The two companies, vying for control of the lucrative spice trade in Indonesia, each sought to oust the Portuguese and dominate the trade. Captain William Keeling and his ship, Hector, had been cruising the Banda Islands, the world&#x2019;s sole source of nutmeg and mace, trying to secure a cargo of spices for the past month. He had struck up a cordial relationship with Dutch traders stationed on the remote and tiny islands, enjoying dinners ashore and tours of the plantations. All the friendliness dissipated, however, with the arrival of Verhoef&#x2019;s fleet. One of Verhoef&#x2019;s first actions to frustrate Keeling&#x2019;s business was to pay the Bandanese headmen, the orang kaya, to stop trading with the English. Keeling complained that Verhoef treated him and his men &#x201c;most unkindlye, searching his boate disgracefullye and not suffering him to have any further trade, not to gather in his debts, but with a peremptory command, to be gone.&#x201d; More ominously, an English sailor employed in the Dutch fleet deserted and informed his countrymen that Verhoef was planning a secret attack on them within weeks.</p> <p>Keeling pondered his predicament. &#x201c;Sixty-two men against a thousand or more could not perform much,&#x201d; he wrote despondently. Weighing anchor, he took the Hector off to one of the more distant islands, Ai, and began to purchase and load his ship with nutmeg far from the interference of the Dutch. The largest island of the tiny archipelago was called Lonthor, or Great Banda, where several thousand Bandanese tended the largest and most valuable nutmeg plantations. The islands of Neira and Gunung Api were clustered within gunshot of Great Banda. Ai was a little distance to the west, and the smallest of the islands, Run, was farther west. On Great Banda, Verhoef wasted no time in menacing and overawing the islanders, and in enforcing a Dutch company monopoly that excluded all English, Portuguese, Malay and Chinese traders from acquiring a cargo of nutmeg.</p> <p>On April 19, Verhoef ordered 250 heavily armed company troops to disembark from the ships and form up on the beach. He then summoned the orang kaya to hear his speech and petition. When they had gathered, under the shade of a great tree, he distributed gifts and ceremoniously unfurled a parchment. He proceeded to read his pronouncement, first in Portuguese and then in Malay. The islanders had broken their promise, Verhoef intoned, &#x201c;to have trade only with them, who had now traded there six years.&#x201d; Verhoef pointed across the narrow waterway that separated Lonthor from Neira, and informed them that &#x201c;to defend themselves and the whole country from the Portugals,&#x201d; his men would soon begin building a fort and permanent factory on Neira. The orang kaya were as dismayed as Verhoef was determined.</p> <p>The trouble stemmed from an incident that had occurred several years earlier. On May 23, 1602, Dutch captain Wolfert Harmenszoon persuaded some of Neira&#x2019;s chiefs to sign a contract, in Dutch&#x2014;a language they couldn&#x2019;t read&#x2014;granting the Dutch East India Company a monopoly in the nutmeg trade. Some, but not all, of the orang kaya had signed the agreement, fearing to offend the merchants and invite violent reprisals if they refused. But since there was no real benefit in reserving all their spice for the Dutch, they had not abided by the agreement&#x2014;if, indeed, they had ever considered doing so. Now it appeared that the Dutch were taking this document seriously and intending to apply it to all of the nutmeg trade on all the Banda Islands, not just to the region controlled by the signatories.</p> <p>The Bandanese lived in a series of interrelated coastal villages on the islands but, unlike others in the Moluccas, had no overall king or chief. Verhoef did not understand the islands&#x2019; loose governing structure, nor did he know with whom to deal; he simply wanted to secure a veneer of legality for his conquest. The several hundred orang kaya of Great Banda were stunned and perplexed by Verhoef&#x2019;s demands, and their response was evasive and guarded&#x2014;Neira was a separate island with its own orangkaya. They delayed, requesting more time to deliberate the issue: the fact that they had little control over what Verhoef did across the waterway. But the prospect of a permanent stone fort within gunshot distance of their own harbour boded ill.</p> <p>The Bandanese were reminded of a prophecy made a few years earlier by a Muslim holy man that foretold of white strangers from afar who would one day conquer their islands. English traders had mirthfully associated this prophecy with the Dutch. The islanders, however, did not want to be locked into dealing with the Dutch. They much preferred Chinese, Arab and Javanese traders, who were frequently in port, bringing goods the Bandanese valued, such as batiks, calicoes, rice, sago palm, porcelain and medicines. They shared cultures with these peoples, and sometimes religion. The Dutch traders, on the other hand, did not impress with their often useless trade goods, such as woollen and velvet cloth, their strange religion, their irregular visits, ignorance of local customs and inflexible prices. Particularly annoying was Verhoef&#x2019;s demand that the islanders stop selling nutmeg and mace to anyone but the Dutch traders. Further unsettling the Bandanese was the eruption of a volcano on nearby Gunung Api. Ominously, the volcano belched a cloud of cinders and ashes onto Neira just as Verhoef&#x2019;s fleet arrived.</p> <p>As the days and weeks passed in stalled negotiations, Verhoef became agitated and uneasy. He had other business to attend to, particularly his similar mission of securing the Dutch East India Company monopoly over cloves at the islands of Tidore and Ternate, farther north. On April 25, 1609, he ordered about 750 of his soldiers ashore on Neira and set them to work clearing the foundations of an abandoned Portuguese fort. The people of the nearby villages fled to the hills or other islands, and Dutch troops and workers soon occupied their dwellings. Lacking the military power to dislodge the Dutch, and with the walls of the fort creeping ominously higher, the islanders on May 22 sought a meeting with Verhoef to discuss the details of the monopoly he demanded. They selected a remote site on the east of the island for the meeting, and Verhoef set off with a coterie of compatriots, including his most trusted captains, senior merchants and a contingent of heavily armed soldiers. He also dragged along, according to a biased English account, a string of English captives chained together to demonstrate his dominance over that upstart nation.</p> <p>The clearing, however, was deserted. No one was waiting for Verhoef at the appointed meeting place, underneath a giant tree on the beach. Curious rather than afraid, he ordered his interpreter, Adriaan Ilsevier, to scout the surrounding woods, where Ilsevier stumbled upon a group of orang kaya suspiciously concealed in the brush. They informed him that they had become frightened at the sight of so many armed Dutchmen. Would Verhoef please leave his soldiers, arms and guns under the tree, bringing only his senior negotiators to them so that they could talk safely, without the soldiers shadowing the talks?</p> <p>Secure in his assumed superiority, Verhoef consented. He and dozens of his staff marched unarmed into the brush, &#x201c;and being entered among them he found the woods replenished with armed blackamoores, Bandanese, and orang kaya who instantly encircled them and without much conference between them&#x2026;, were by them treacherously and villainously massacred.&#x201d; They screamed out &#x201c;To arms!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Admiral, we are betrayed!&#x201d; but to no avail. Unarmed, they were quickly killed and none escaped. It happened so fast and unexpectedly that the armed guards who rushed the short distance to defend their commander and comrades arrived to find them all slaughtered. Verhoef had been decapitated, and his head was placed on a spiked stick. Over the next few weeks, there was a general uprising of the Bandanese against the Dutch, who scarcely left their ships or the fort. Their work on the half-completed castle, Fort Nassau, continued at an accelerated pace.</p> <p>The new leader of the Dutch company&#x2019;s forces, Simon Hoen, began to &#x201c;execute and practise all revenge possible&#x201d; by attacking islanders, burning villages, burning and destroying boats and plundering anything of value. After some of his troops suffered a defeat by Bandanese forces on July 26, Hoen retreated and ordered a naval blockade of the islands to stop the food imports vital to the survival of the people and to bring commerce to a halt. Soon many of the orang kaya were willing to accede to the company&#x2019;s demands, and they sat down to negotiate with the Dutch invaders. On August 13 they grudgingly agreed to the Dutch monopoly over the nutmeg trade; all incoming ships now had to present themselves at Fort Nassau for inspection and to obtain a pass. And, furthermore, no one could settle on the islands without the permission of the company commander. The entire island of Neira was to become a dominion of the Dutch East India Company, &#x201c;to be kept by us forever&#x201d;&#x2014;the first territorial acquisition by the company.</p> <p>Hoen then sailed north, with the bulk of his fleet, to do business with Ternate and Tidore. But even after this first conquest the Bandanese showed no compunction about working around the Dutch monopoly, secretly shipping their nutmeg to English merchants who had established factories on the outlying islands of Ai and Run. Securing a trade monopoly was simple in theory but difficult to enforce, even on the remote and tiny Banda Islands.</p> <p>In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the Netherlands was arguably the wealthiest and most scientifically advanced of the European nations. This period, known as the Dutch Golden Age, brought a flourishing of the arts and sciences that reflected the period&#x2019;s unbounded optimism and affluence. Prosperous burghers and merchants became patrons of the arts, including sculpture, poetry and drama, and of public debates. They commissioned architects to design beautiful houses. Paintings and sculptures adorned the interior walls of these impressive homes. Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, Jacob van Ruisdael and many others revolutionized painting, infusing new life into landscapes, portraiture and still life, as well as portraying contemporary life and society in the flourishing cities that were the most cosmopolitan in Europe. In science, the list of internationally prominent luminaries included the philosopher Ren� Descartes; acclaimed jurist and theorist of international law Hugo Grotius; mathematician, astronomer and inventor of the pendulum clock Christiaan Huygens; and Anton van Leeuwenhoek, inventor of the microscope and founder of the study of microbiology. Book publishing flourished in the climate of tolerance and intellectual curiosity; ideas concerning religion, philosophy and science that were considered too controversial in other nations found their way into print in the Netherlands, and the books were secretly shipped abroad.</p> <p>The Dutch Republic, newly freed from Spanish domination and relishing its freedom, was admirably situated to dominate European trade by providing an artery into the interior. Thousands of ships crowded its many harbours. The great city of Amsterdam was the centre of the international trade in the exotic luxuries of the Americas, India and the &#x201c;Spice Islands.&#x201d; The Amsterdam stock exchange, founded in 1602, was the world&#x2019;s first, created by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) for dealing in its own stocks and bonds. The VOC was the first-ever trading company with a permanent share capital. This joint stock company attracted huge wealth in initial capitalization from over 1,800 investors, most of whom were merchants and other wealthy middle-class citizens, and the speculation on the fluctuating value of these shares relied on the success or failure of the company&#x2019;s ships in bringing spices back to Europe from the Far East.</p> <p>The first great global corporation, the VOC, was by the late seventeenth century the most powerful and richest company in the world. Its private fleet boasted nearly 150 merchant ships and 40 giant warships. At the height of its power, it employed nearly 50,000 people worldwide&#x2014;seamen, artisans, stevedores, labourers, clerks and builders. The company was involved in a multitude of commercial activities, such as construction, sugar refining, cloth manufacturing, tobacco curing, weaving, glass making, distilling, brewing and other industries related to its global business enterprises. The payroll also included a 10,000-man private army.</p> <p>The VOC, one of the foundations of Dutch prosperity and with its mighty fleet a key force propelling the young republic to look to the world for commerce, held a virtual monopoly over the global spice supply. It achieved this in a bloody struggle at the dawn of the Age of Heroic Commerce. Ironically, the company&#x2019;s wealth was founded on a system and on values imposed in Indonesia that ran counter to the liberal and tolerant culture of many of its shareholders. Furthermore, its rise to global supremacy as a state monopoly, and its contribution to the artistic and cultural flourishing of the Dutch Republic, was founded on the ruthless strategy of a man whose character was entirely at odds with the character of his nation.</p> <p>Sailing as part of Peter Verhoef&#x2019;s expedition, and witness to what he termed the &#x201c;Vile Bandanese Treachery of 1609,&#x201d; was a junior trader named Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Bandanese uprising and resistance to the VOC, he believed, had been sponsored by perfidious English agents and furthered by the untrustworthy nature of the Bandanese. Coen was destined for historical greatness and, some would argue, infamy. More than a decade later, as the governor general of the VOC&#x2019;s enterprise in the East Indies, Coen would see to it that such disrespect for his company did not go unpunished.</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p> <p>The spices of the east indies come from a variet...</p></p><h2>Debussy - The Ultimate Piano Collection: Schirmer Library of Classics Volume 2105 (Schirmer&#39;s Library of Musical Classics)</h2><p>(Piano Collection).

Her <i>What Is a Girl Worth?</i> is a mature, resolute Christian memoir that lends vital perspective to abuse and institutional cover-ups.<br><br>Denhollander details her childhood and upbringing; her visits to a Michigan State University clinic as a teen; Nassar&#x2019;s assaults at the clinic; and her road toward speaking out in 2016, months before the #MeToo movement gathered momentum.<br><br>The long term consequences of Nassar&#x2019;s betrayal are drawn in a clear-eyed way. Denhollander&#x2019;s pain balances with a tender portrait of her husband and family. Her intelligent reflections reveal a woman of faith who chose to sacrifice her privacy and to seek justice with love and determination that no child face the same pain. Separating her own future happiness and healing from the outcome of the trial, she presents peace as possible. Hers is a compelling viewpoint that isn&#x2019;t imposed as a solution for all survivors.<br><br>Also an attorney, Denhollander elucidates the steps she took to bring her case to MSU police. From the first suspicion that Nassar&#x2019;s treatments were anything but medical to his sentencing, the cruel realities of her survival thread with advocacy and everyday motherhood. Nassar is drawn as the thorough, renowned doctor, making his abuse even more chilling.<br><br>Treating a sensitive topic with unflinching truth, respect, and fair-mindedness, <i>What Is a Girl Worth?</i> fuses biblical notions with legal insights, personal journal entries, and heartbreaking data to make a lucid argument regarding the power of a single voice to inspire a chorus. (Foreword Reviews)<br><br><b>Starred review.</b> In this powerful debut, attorney and former gymnast Denhollander tells of her life leading to the 2018 conviction of sexual predator Larry Nassar, a sports physician associated with Michigan State University and the USA Gymnastics team who molested the author and more than 200 other girls. Raised in Kalamazoo, Mich., Denhollander was homeschooled, deeply religious, and aspired to become a lawyer. &#x201c;Gangly&#x201d; and 5'6," she didn&#x2019;t fit the profile of a gymnast but was placed on her gym&#x2019;s competitive team; after sustaining a lower-back injury at age 15, she was sent to Nassar, who would&#x2015;under the guise of treatment, without gloves, and without consent&#x2015;vaginally penetrate her with his fingers. She reported the abuse to her coaches, but, she writes, they didn&#x2019;t believe her; nearly 16 years later when another gymnast&#x2019;s story of abuse by a coach broke, Denhollander decided to speak out again, eventually leading to Nassar&#x2019;s indictment and conviction. Denhollander reveals her anguish and emotional pain, her feelings of helplessness (&#x201c;How do I even try to heal from something, when I don&#x2019;t even know what that &#x2018;something&#x2019; is?&#x201d;). Denhollander&#x2019;s brave and detailed memoir serves as a clear-eyed look into a disturbing case of sexual abuse that gained national attention. (Publishers Weekly)<br><br><b>Starred Review.</b> Denhollander, now an attorney and activist, was the first to share her story publicly when the 2016 USA gymnastics sexual abuse scandal broke. Her authorial debut reveals how she was groomed and abused as a young gymnast, in plain view of an unsuspecting parent, and how she and other survivors brought serial molester Larry Nassar to justice. Reaching beyond her own narrative, Denhollander explores why victims of sexual assault often stay silent; she also describes Nassar&#x2019;s trial in detail and examines the safety nets that failed to protect her and hundreds of his other victims. Her memoir is straightforward and deeply honest about the betrayal she endured yet hopeful for growing awareness and healing. Drawing on her law background and faith-based strength, the former gymnast advocates for positive action against abuse, with her own experiences as the inspirational framework. <b>VERDICT:</b> Essential for sports fans and all readers concerned with the ongoing, widespread challenges of abuse and accountability. Denhollander&#x2019;s story of empowerment deserves wide readership.

We have seen from recent disasters such as hurricanes Katrina, Maria, Harvey and Irma that communities can be on their own for a long period of time until help arrives &#x2013; and these are regional disasters where massive outside resources are still available. </p><p> Here is the fatal flaw of the emergency management system in the United States: it depends on our ability to bring outside resources into a disaster area. But what if the majority of the country was the disaster area? What if cities and towns across the country were on their own for a long period of time? Survival will be a local issue. The cavalry will not be coming. </p><p> The real key to having prepared and resilient communities lies in the communities having a civil defense plan and being prepared for a worst-case scenario, such as a national-scale power outage. This book is about taking pre-disaster mitigation to the next level, so that your town can be ready for any disaster, large or small. </p><p> It is possible for a town to survive if the grid goes down long term. But only if a few of its citizens act now. </p><p> This book takes you through the steps to prepare your town for a worst-case national disaster. And in being prepared for a worst-case scenario, you and your town can be prepared for anything from a minor power outage to a hurricane to an electromagnetic pulse, solar flare or cyber-attack taking out the entire power grid.

You push through the crowds and walk past the Rastafarian selling incense and records outside Starbucks. Across the road is Morleys, the independent department store that has stood on the street for years. &#x201c;Love Brixton&#x201d; glows in neon lights in the nearby window of TK Maxx.<br> <br>Today spring flowers bloom in buckets at the flower stand: daffodils, tulips, and fat peonies. The florist is an old man in a dark green apron with soil under his nails and a gold chain around his neck. Whatever the weather, he sells &#x201c;Sorry&#x201d;s and &#x201c;I love you&#x201d;s at a reasonable price. Wrap it in brown paper and tie it up with ribbon.<br> <br>Next to the station is Electric Avenue: it heaves with people and market stalls selling everything from vegetables to phone chargers. The air smells of sweet melons and the tang of fish. The fish lie on beds of ice, turning it from white to pink throughout the day and reminding you that you should never eat pink snow either.<br> <br>Market traders fling prices across the street at each other, discounts thrown like Frisbees. Catch it quick and throw it back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Three for a tenner, threeforatenner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t miss out, three for a fiver, THREEFORAFIVER.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Three for a fiver? I&#x2019;ve got five for a fiver!&#x201d;<br> <br>On the other side of the street Kate walks quickly home from her job as a journalist at the Brixton Chronicle. She doesn&#x2019;t have time to examine vegetables. Or maybe she just wouldn&#x2019;t know what to look for. It may be spring, but Kate is living under a cloud. It follows her wherever she goes, and however hard she tries she can&#x2019;t seem to outrun it. She weaves through the crowds, desperate to make it back to her house and to close the door behind her and climb into bed. When she is not at work, her bed is where she spends most of her time. On the street, she attempts to block out the sounds around her, trying not to let them fill her up and overwhelm her. She keeps her head down and focuses on the pavement.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; she says, stepping past a plump elderly woman without looking up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; says Rosemary, letting Kate pass. She watches the back of the young woman hurrying away&#x2014;the woman is petite with a midlength light brown ponytail flicking behind her with the speed of her walk. Rosemary smiles, remembering what it was like to be in a rush. At eighty-six, she rarely goes anywhere fast. Instead she carries her shopping and walks slowly away from the market and toward her flat on the edge of Brockwell Park. She is dressed plainly but neatly in trousers, comfortable shoes, and a spring mackintosh, her thin, wavy gray hair pulled back from her face and secured with a clip. Over time her body has changed to the point that she barely recognizes it anymore, but her eyes are still the same&#x2014;bright blue and smiling even when her mouth isn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>Today is Rosemary&#x2019;s shopping day. She has made the rounds at all her favorite shops and stalls, said hello to Ellis the fruit and veg man, and collected her weekly brown bag of food. She has popped into the secondhand bookshop run by Frank and his partner, Jermaine. The three of them chatted for a while, Rosemary sharing the window seat with their golden retriever, Sprout, and looking along the shelves for something new or something she might have missed last week. She likes stopping there and breathing in the musty old smell of hundreds of books.<br> <br>After the bookshop, Rosemary steps inside Brixton Village and is hit by the smell of cooking spices and the noise of people talking and eating at tables in the passageways&#x2014;the same noises and smells she has become accustomed to through her weekly visits. The market is airy and some restaurants provide blankets that people drape over their shoulders or laps as they eat. Strings of lights hang from the high ceiling, making it feel like a Christmas market even in the spring.<br> <br>To Rosemary and her friend Hope, whom she meets here for a weekly catch-up and slice of cake, it&#x2019;s still Granville Arcade, the only place where Hope could find the Caribbean foods she so missed when she first moved to Brixton when she was twelve. It is now filled with independent restaurants, shops, and stallholders. The change still unsettles them but they like the coffee shop where the young barista knows their orders and starts making them as soon as he sees them approaching through the window. And the cake is delicious. Hope speaks proudly about her granddaughter, Aiesha, and her daughter, Jamila&#x2014;busy as usual with work. When Jamila passed her final medical exams, Rosemary had sent her flowers with a card that read, &#x201c;Dear Doctor . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Hope and Rosemary reminisce about when they worked in the library.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you remember the first time Robert plucked up the courage to ask you out?&#x201d; says Rosemary with a laugh. Hope&#x2019;s husband, Robert, had been a bus driver before retiring a few years ago, and when they were both young he would visit the library every few days after his shift, looking around eagerly for Hope&#x2019;s hourglass figure.<br> <br>&#x201c;It took him long enough,&#x201d; Hope says, laughing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll always remember how you used to disappear up a ladder and stack books when he was there so he&#x2019;d be forced to speak to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>The two women chuckle together, both of them relishing this part of their week. But now Rosemary&#x2019;s feet hurt and she is ready to be home.<br> <br>&#x201c;Same time next week?&#x201d; says Rosemary as they part, hugging her friend and realizing that at sixty-eight, Hope, too, is now an old woman. She squeezes her a little tighter&#x2014;to Rosemary she will always be the cheerful young girl who started at the library when she was eighteen and who Rosemary took under her wing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Same time next week,&#x201d; says Hope, giving a final wave as she turns off down the street to collect Aiesha from school (the favorite part of her day).<br> <br>Now, Rosemary passes the queues for the bus stops and crosses the junction where the old cinema stands on the corner, the names of this week&#x2019;s films spelled out in white letters on the black board. Opposite is a large square where elderly men sit in chairs and smoke while teenagers skateboard around them.<br> <br>As she gets farther away from the station, shops turn into terraced houses and blocks of flats. Eventually she reaches the Hootananny, the rickety old pub famous for its live music. A strong, sweet smell floats from the benches outside where people sit and drink pints and smoke. Here she turns left and follows the road that wraps around the edge of the park toward the mid-rise building where she lives.<br> <br>The lift, often broken, is working and she is relieved.<br> <br>Rosemary has lived in the flat on the third floor for most of her life. She moved there with her husband, George, in 1950 when the building was newly built and they were newly married. The front door leads straight into the living room, where the most noticeable thing is the bookshelf that runs the full length of the right-hand wall.<br> <br>The kitchen next to it fits a table, two chairs, and a television that rests on the washing machine. When Rosemary has unpacked her shopping, she crosses the living room, opens the doors, and steps onto the balcony. Her navy swimsuit hangs from the washing line like a flag. There are plants out here: just a few potted lavender, nothing too extravagant&#x2014;it wouldn&#x2019;t suit her. Rosemary can see Brockwell Park stretching ahead of her, taking her far from the noise and the crowds at Electric Avenue.<br> <br>Spring is in bloom and the park wears a new green coat. There are the tennis courts, a garden, and a small hill with an old house that used to be a manor and is now used for events and a concession selling ice cream and snacks to sticky-fingered children. Two sets of train tracks loop around the park: the real one and a miniature one that is only for the summer and very small children. The sun is just starting to set and Rosemary can see people, enjoying the lengthening days. Runners make their way up the hill and down again. And on the edge of the park closest to her balcony a low redbrick building wraps its arms around a perfect blue rectangle of water. The pool is striped with ropes that split the lanes and she can see bright towels on the decking. Swimmers float in the water like petals. It is a place she knows well. It is the lido, her lido.</p><h2>52 Weeks of Conscious Contact: Meditations for Connecting with God, Self, and Others (Hazelden Meditation)</h2><p><b>Organized as weekly collections of stories, meditations, and suggestions, <i>52 Weeks of Conscious Contact</i> addresses key self-care issues.</b><br><br>What gets in the way of serenity?

On a shoestring budget and with little support, Pedersen picked eight of the finest pilots to help train a new generation to bend jets like the F-4 Phantom to their will and learn how to dogfight all over again. <br> <br> What resulted was nothing short of a revolution -- one that took young American pilots from the crucible of combat training in the California desert to the blistering skies of Vietnam, in the process raising America's Navy combat kill ratio from two enemy planes downed for every American plane lost to more than 22 to 1. Topgun emerged not only as an icon of America's military dominance immortalized by Hollywood but as a vital institution that would shape the nation's military strategy for generations to come.<br><br> Pedersen takes readers on a colorful and thrilling ride -- from Miramar to Area 51 to the decks of aircraft carriers in war and peace-through a historic moment in air warfare. He helped establish a legacy that was built by him and his "Original Eight" -- the best of the best -- and carried on for six decades by some of America's greatest leaders. <i>Topgun</i> is a heartfelt and personal testimony to patriotism, sacrifice, and American innovation and daring.</p><p><b>Dan Pedersen </b>entered the U.S. Navy in 1953. He was the senior officer in the group of nine men who formed the Navy's legendary "Topgun" program at Naval Air Station Miramar in March 1969. He served in combat during the Vietnam War, with a flying cruise on USS <i>Hancock</i> (CVA-19) and three on USS <i>Enterprise</i> (CVN-65). He retired as a captain, having accumulated 6,100 flight hours and 1,005 carrier landings while flying 39 types of aircraft. He lives with his wife outside San Diego."If you loved the movie, you will love the real story in the book."&#x2015;<b><i>Pete Hegseth, <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i></i></b><br><br>"If an institution is the lengthened shadow of a single man, then the history of modern naval aviation might well be described as the lengthened shadow of Dan Pedersen.

He lives in Northridge, California.Iron smashed into my head. <br><br>I was lying on my back when I came to. I had no idea as to how much time had passed. My entire skull pulsed with pain, and I was nauseous and dizzy. <br><br>My right knee throbbed. It was dark, and for a moment I thought it was night. I turned my head and saw daylight, and from somewhere heard Russian being yelled. I looked up, and again saw the underbelly of a tank, about two meters above me; one tread was broken, putting it out of action. It had come to a stop above me, straddling the trench. I ran a hand through my hair. It was wet with blood, and there was a large lump just above the hairline. I reached down and felt my pounding right knee; it was bloody, and my fingers came upon a jagged piece of shrapnel that felt embedded in the joint. I rolled sideways. All around me were the ugly leftovers of the battle: shell casings, wooden boxes, helmets, weapons, empty canisters&#x2014;and dead soldiers, both Russian and German. More of the same filled the trench to either side of the tank. <br><br>When I turned to look, a dead arm flopped down on the back of my neck, knocking my head downward. My chin came to rest on the gray-green of a dead German&#x2019;s chest. And looking right into my face was another face, that of a blond Russian boy, his lifeless eyes locked open in disbelief. I looked away as I suddenly became aware of the sound of distant battle&#x2014;then almost jumped at the sound of a nearby gunshot. <br><br>I heard someone pleading in German&#x2014;then another shot. I belly-crawled a half meter and peered out. What I saw sickened and terrified me. A Russian officer was methodically seeking out the German wounded and shooting them. <br><br>A lumbering oaf of a foot soldier, using a bayonet, was dispatching other Germans. He seemed to be enjoying what he was doing. And many of those he was bayoneting looked already dead; he was just making sure. <br><br>I froze at the sound of nearby voices. <br><br>&#x201c;I want this tank operational immediately!&#x201d; someone was demanding in Russian. <br><br>&#x201c;I will do my best, master sergeant,&#x201d; came the response. &#x201c;Parts are in short supply.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Just get it done!&#x201d; <br><br>The voices were close, but I could not tell from where they were coming exactly. Two booted legs jumped into the trench, followed by another pair. My heart pounded so hard and loud I was sure it would be heard. Two Russians knelt down in the trench beside the tank and examined the dangling, shattered tread. Remembering Dobelmann&#x2019;s words, I played dead among the dead. <br><br>&#x201c;And how does the idiot think we are supposed to repair it?&#x201d; groused one of the men. <br><br>&#x201c;We will need another T-34 tank to pull it free,&#x201d; came the reply. <br><br>&#x201c;Prinisitye mnye pazhalusta adin T-34!&#x201d; <br><br>Both laughed. One had joked that their superior officer acted as though they could repair the tank by magic. <br><br>The two figures rose, and out of a slitted eye I saw two pairs of legs headed away, down the trench. They paused for a moment and huddled with a man who had the white cross of a medic on his helmet, and helped him tend to a badly wounded Russian soldier. Between the three of them, using a blanket as a makeshift stretcher, they trundled the wounded man out of the trench. <br><br>Entangled in carnage and debris, boxed in by the walls of the trench and the bottom of the tank, I lay there wondering what to do, too frightened to do anything. I wanted someone to help me, to talk to me, as my mother would, and tell me what to do. I looked for help, and saw only the dead. <br><br>From somewhere down the trench came another bang. Perhaps another wounded German had been executed? <br><br>My gut knotted with fear. Over and over, I kept hearing what Dobelmann had said to us just one day before. <br><br>I tried to think. <br><br>We had been overrun. In the distance, in the direction of the bunkered hill, fierce fighting continued; battles that I could not see were being fought. More Russians were passing by every minute. <br><br>I heard them; I saw them scramble through the trench. <br><br>I was trapped behind enemy lines. <br><br>If discovered, I would be killed. Even playing dead would not save me; even dead, once found, I would be skewered on the end of a bayonet. <br><br>I had only one chance, I knew, to save myself. <br><br>The dead eyes of the blond Russian boy seemed to be watching me. With my fingers, I closed the lids. Strange though it may seem, I did not want him looking at me and at what I was about to do. <br><br>In that cramped and bloody charnel house beneath the tank, I removed my clothes&#x2014;even my socks and underwear&#x2014;then exchanged my clothes for his. <br><br>The task was very difficult. I was in considerable pain, especially from my right knee, from which the ragged bit of metal was protruding, and it was extremely awkward undressing then trying to re-dress the inert body, the limbs of which were already turning stiff. <br><br>During this last part of the gruesome process, I had to stop. The two Russians I had heard before returned; they crawled in amidst the bodies and examined the tank&#x2019;s underside, then commenced cutting and pulling out long strands of barbed wire that had become entangled in its drive wheels. At this juncture, I was no more than half done re-dressing the corpse in my own uniform. Sick with fear, only a few centimeters from the two men, I lay frozen in place, certain that I would be found out. But the minds of the two&#x2014;both seemingly mechanics&#x2014;were on other things; they paid not the slightest bit of attention to me, to the half-dressed corpse, or to any of the bodies. <br><br>Finally, they left, and I finished my ugly chore as fast as I could. In the pocket of the brown jacket I felt a bulge, and removed a wallet. In it there were a few rubles and a military identification card. In the dim light I tried to make out the name. I was unable to, and returned the wallet to my pocket. <br><br>I crawled. I pulled myself from under the tank and along the trench, over more bodies and more trash. From somewhere came the sound of approaching vehicles and far-off voices. Russian voices. Amidst more dead and more trash, I leaned back against the wall of the trench, thinking back. Hals had been killed, and before that, Willi had lost an arm, Fassnacht a foot. Oskar had been shot in the back, running away. But Jakob was still alive, as far as I knew, and so was Dobelmann. I looked at the faces of the dead in the trench, wondering if I would see Dobelmann or Jakob&#x2014;and hoping I wouldn&#x2019;t, hoping that somehow they were still alive. <br><br>Sitting there leaning against the wall of the trench, every part of me hurt, especially my knee. I pulled up the brown pant leg. The knee was badly swollen, and just below the kneecap a piece of steel was protruding. It looked as though a large, misshapen nail had been driven into my leg. Something occurred to me: The shrapnel had hit my knee before I had changed uniforms, so there was no tear in the pants; someone seeing this might become suspicious. Rubbing the woolen fabric back and forth over the jagged spike, I ripped a hole in the pant leg, exposing the wound. <br><br>Over trash, dead bodies, and collapsed earth, I crawled out of the trench. Not knowing where I was going or what I was doing, I found myself wandering along what had been our front lines, limping, using a Russian rifle for support. The dead were everywhere, in whatever final pose death had forced upon them. Gutted tanks and other vehicles continued burning. I became aware that I was approaching a man&#x2014;a Russian&#x2014;sitting against the charred and shattered stump of a tree. His face was caked with grime and his hair singed off. He held badly burned arms out in front of him. They were lathered with some kind of yellowish unguent, as though they had been frosted. He was grimacing in pain; brown eyes gave me a distressed, curious look. <br><br>&#x201c;Galava krushitsa.&#x201d; I told him in Russian that I was very dizzy. <br><br>Brown eyes blinked, looked at me uncomprehendingly as I hobbled past him. The pain in my knee became more than I could bear. I sat down on a broken slab of concrete. Before me, amidst heaps of other debris, was what remained of a shattered German blockhouse. One wall had been shorn away; and inside the place I could see dead men and a broken-looking weapon, a light artillery piece. An uprooted tree lay beside the blockhouse; beneath its fallen branches&#x2014;a bouquet of dead, black-brown sticks&#x2014;lay the body of a German officer. His body looked broken everywhere; his uniform was smoldering. <br><br>&#x201c;Moy!&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Nyet, moy!&#x201d; <br><br>Across the way, two Russians were arguing like a couple of kids. Scrounging for souvenirs, food, and any usable goods, they had come upon something they both wanted for some reason. They started bargaining, haggling: for a can <br><br>of peaches, one would give the other a German sheath knife. I grabbed to where my sheath knife should have been, and realized there was none: I was wearinga Russian uniform and Russian gear, and there was a canteen there instead of a knife. <br><br>From far behind me came a sudden flurry of gunfire, and then a series of explosions. Reduced to a spectator, I turned and looked to the horseshoe-shaped hillside&#x2014;German battalion headquarters. A huge Soviet flag&#x2014;red, with a hammer and sickle&#x2014;had been raised. <br><br>It looked tiny in the distance, but it told me most of what I needed to know. Flurries of fighting were still going on in various areas of the hill, in and around the bunkers. To the south, German tanks were burning; a few others were in retreat, firing as they raced backward. Clearly the battle had been lost. <br><br>We had been defeated. <br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know if I even cared. <br><br>I cared about the friends I had lost. Hals and Oskar. Their deaths filled me with grief. And I was angry with them&#x2014;for dying, for leaving me.I turned my attention to my knee and began pulling at the spike of shrapnel buried in my flesh. I could move it a little from side to side but couldn&#x2019;t pull it out, I leaned back against the blockhouse, my eyes on the dead German officer. <br><br>I heard footsteps, and looked up to see a large number of fresh Russian troops coming in my direction. I was terrified, momentarily; it was my delusion that they were coming just to get me. Frightened, I stood up. Using the wall of the battered blockhouse for support, I made my way around to the other side of it&#x2014;as though I could hide there; then I did an even stranger thing: I waved at the Russians, as I had so many years ago at parading Wehrmacht troops. <br><br>Surprisingly, someone waved back. <br><br>Leaning heavily against the Russian rifle, I heard a scratching, rustling sound on the other side of the blockhouse. I saw a hand&#x2014;a left hand&#x2014;come around the other side of it. The hand was in a claw shape; fingertips dug into loose soil. <br><br>A man, the German officer I had left for dead on the other side of the blockhouse, pulled himself into view. His face covered with grime and soot, his legs seemingly useless, he was dragging himself along the ground like some sort of fire-blackened, badly injured alligator. <br><br>He looked up at me, and at first I didn&#x2019;t realize that what he was seeing was the enemy&#x2014;and perhaps his executioner. <br><br>&#x201c;Nein!&#x201d; he rasped. <br><br>I did not see the pistol in his right hand until he fired. A bullet whined past my face. He fired again. I flew backward as something hot hit me in the side; then I was just sitting on the ground, pressing a hand to my belly and looking at the German. He was continuing to slither away. A rifle shot rang out. He slumped, stopped moving. <br><br>&#x201c;Pamagite!&#x201d; <br><br>A Russian soldier hurried toward me, a smoking rifle in hand, and he was calling for others to come help him.Strong hands helped me lie down on my back.A bearded face loomed into view. &#x201c;Are you hit bad?&#x201d; the man asked in Russian. <br><br>I looked up and saw what I thought was my grandfather. <br><br>&#x201c;Dyshyte narmal&#x2019;na!&#x201d; Breathe nor-mally, he said. Kneeling beside me, he pressed a pad of gauze to the wound in my side. &#x201c;Just take it easy, son,&#x201d; he said in Russian. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to make it.&#x201d;</p><h2>U.S.S.

Described by one reviewer as &#x201c;like getting stabbed in the head,&#x201d; the $6 million film earned a grand total of $1,800 at the box office and closed after two weeks. Ten years later, it&#x2019;s an international cult phenomenon, whose legions of fans attend screenings featuring costumes, audience rituals, merchandising, and thousands of plastic spoons. Hailed by <i>The Huffington Post</i> as &#x201c;possibly the most important piece of literature ever printed,&#x201d; <i>The Disaster Artist</i> is the hilarious, behind-the-scenes story of a deliciously awful cinematic phenomenon as well as the story of an odd and inspiring Hollywood friendship. Greg Sestero, Tommy&#x2019;s costar, recounts the film&#x2019;s bizarre journey to infamy, explaining how the movie&#x2019;s many nonsensical scenes and bits of dialogue came to be and unraveling the mystery of Tommy Wiseau himself.

This year I&#x2019;m trying to earn a living.<br> <br>&#x2014;Sunset Boulevard<br> <br>Tommy Wiseau has always been an eccentric dresser, but on a late-summer night in 2002 he was turning the heads of every model, weirdo, transvestite, and face-lift artist in and around Hollywood&#x2019;s Palm Restaurant. People couldn&#x2019;t stop looking at him; I couldn&#x2019;t stop looking at him. Even today, a decade later, I still can&#x2019;t unsee Tommy&#x2019;s outfit: nighttime sunglasses, a dark blazer as loose and baggy as rain gear, sand-colored cargo pants with pockets filled to capacity (was he smuggling potatoes?), a white tank top, clunky Frankenstein combat boots, and two belts. Yes, two belts. The first belt was at home in its loops; the second draped down in back to cup Tommy&#x2019;s backside, which was, he always claimed, the point: &#x201c;It keeps my ass up. Plus it feels good.&#x201d; And then there was Tommy himself: short and muscular; his face as lumpy and white as an abandoned draft of a sculpture; his enormous snow-shovel jaw; his long, thick, impossibly black hair, seemingly dyed in Magic Marker ink&#x2014;and currently sopping wet. Moments before we walked in, Tommy had dumped a bottle of Arrowhead water over his head to keep &#x201c;this poofy stuff&#x201d; from afflicting his considerable curls. He had also refused to let the Palm&#x2019;s valet park his silver SL500 Mercedes-Benz, worried the guy would fart in his seat.<br> <br>At this point I&#x2019;d known Tommy for almost half a decade. Tommy and I looked more like Marvel Comics nemeses than people who could be friends. I was a tall, sandy-blond Northern California kid. Tommy, meanwhile, appeared to have been grown somewhere dark and moist. I knew exactly where Tommy and I fit in among the Palm&#x2019;s mixture of Hollywood sharks, minnows, and tourists. I was twenty-four years old&#x2014;a minnow, like Tommy. That meant we had at least thirty minutes to wait for a table. Upon entering the restaurant, I could see various diners consulting their mental Rolodexes, trying to place Tommy. Gene Simmons after three months in the Gobi Desert? The Hunchback of Notre Dame following corrective surgery? An escaped Muppet? The drummer from Ratt?<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t wait in the line,&#x201d; Tommy said, speaking to me over his shoulder. He marched up to the Palm&#x2019;s hostess. I kept my distance, as I always did at times like this, and waited for the inevitable moment in which Tommy spoke and the person to whom he was speaking tried to make geographical sense of his pronunciation, which sounded like an Eastern European accent that had been hit by a Parisian bus. The hostess asked Tommy if he had a reservation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We have table reservation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s the name?&#x201d; she said, slightly sarcastically, but only slightly, because who knew whether Ratt was on the verge of releasing a Greatest Hits album? Her job required carefully hedging one&#x2019;s fame-related bets.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ron,&#x201d; Tommy said.<br> <br>She checked her list. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she said, tapping her pencil on the page. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no Ron here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, sorry,&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Robert.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked down. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no Robert here, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tommy laughed. &#x201c;Wait, I remember now. Try John.&#x201d;<br> <br>The hostess found the name John near the bottom of her list.<br> <br>&#x201c;John,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Party of four?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes,&#x201d; Tommy said, summoning me over to bring him one party member closer to accuracy.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know who &#x201c;John, party of four&#x201d; actually was, but the hostess snagged a wine menu and began walking us to our table.<br> <br>I followed Tommy and the hostess through the Palm&#x2019;s dim interior and looked at the dozens of movie-star caricatures that lined its walls. There was Jack Nicholson, Bette Davis, O. J. Simpson&#x2014;which made me wonder: What, exactly, did you have to do to get banished from the wall of the Palm? I noticed some starry faces sitting at the tables, too. Well, maybe not starry, but midsize astral phenomena: sports broadcaster Al Michaels, colleague to my beloved John Madden; Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Josie Maran; the cohost on our local ABC News. There were also lots of faces unknown to me but obviously connected. These mostly middle-aged men and women talked show business at conversational levels, and real show business sotto voce. The waiters were all older, beefy guys who smelled of expensive aftershave and had big, white, manicured nails; they were such smooth operators, they almost managed to convince you it didn&#x2019;t matter that you weren&#x2019;t famous. The air in the Palm was very expensive. Everything, other than the food, tasted like money.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; Tommy said indignantly, after the hostess showed us to our table. &#x201c;Excuse me but no. I don&#x2019;t sit here. I want booth.&#x201d; Tommy always insisted on a booth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, our booths are reserved.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Tommy was nothing if not unrelenting. I think the hostess figured she had two options: Give Tommy a booth or call animal control to tranq him. Through a combination of lying, grandstanding, and bullying, Tommy and I were now seated in a booth in the nicest section of the Palm. As soon as Tommy sat down he flagged someone down and said he was &#x201c;starving&#x201d; and ready to order.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t work here,&#x201d; the person said.<br> <br>Whenever Tommy is in a restaurant, he always orders a glass of hot water. I&#x2019;ve never seen a waiter or waitress do anything but balk at the request.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s how the Palm&#x2019;s waiter handled it: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Did you say a glass of&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tommy: &#x201c;Hot water. Yes. This is what I am saying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A lemon maybe or&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, why you give me hard time? Do I speak Chinese? This is simple request, my God. Are you tipsy or something? And more bread with raisin stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>We were at the Palm to celebrate. The following morning, official production would begin on The Room, a film Tommy had conceived, written, produced, cast, and was now directing and set to star in. If you&#x2019;d known Tommy as long as I had, the beginning of The Room&#x2019;s production was a miracle of biblical significance. I&#x2019;d worked on the film with him, on and off, since its inception. My most recent and intense job on the film was working as Tommy&#x2019;s line producer. When we began, I had no idea what a line producer was. Neither did Tommy. Basically, I was doing anything that needed to be done. I scheduled all auditions, meetings, and rehearsals; ran the casting sessions; helped find equipment; and, most challenging, made sure Tommy didn&#x2019;t sabotage his own film. In a sense I was his outside-world translator, since no one knew him better than I did. I was also in charge of writing the checks that were flying out the door of Wiseau-Films like doves in search of dry land. For all this, Tommy was paying me a decent wage, plus &#x201c;perks,&#x201d; which was what Tommy called food. With Tommy&#x2019;s vanity project about to begin, my plan was to walk into my eight-dollars-an-hour retail job at French Connection the next day and quit. I hoped never again to fold something I wasn&#x2019;t going to wear myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Tommy said, taking off his sunglasses. His eyes were red with veiny lightning. &#x201c;We are in production. How do you feel?&#x201d; He started to wrangle his hair into a scrunchie-secured ponytail.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s great,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Tommy was looking at me directly, which didn&#x2019;t happen that often. He was sensitive about his left eyelid, which drooped noticeably, and he rarely held anyone&#x2019;s gaze. When he did talk to someone he&#x2019;d try to hold his face to the left, which he thought was his best angle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you nervous little bit?&#x201d; Tommy asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For big day tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Should I be nervous?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged. As we ate, we talked a little more, and things in the Palm started to wind down. Nine p.m. is, however, Tommy&#x2019;s noon, so as the Palm became emptier and more sedate, Tommy grew more and more energetic. I had to get home for a number of reasons, not the least of which was my girlfriend, Amber. She wasn&#x2019;t a fan of Tommy&#x2019;s and hated it when I wasn&#x2019;t with her on her nights off.<br> <br>Tommy leaned forward. He&#x2019;d never touched his hot water. &#x201c;What you think now about The Room?&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d told Tommy what I thought about The Room several times, which was that the script didn&#x2019;t make any sense. Characters&#x2019; motivations changed from scene to scene, important plot points were raised and then dropped, and all of the dialogue sounded exactly the same, which is to say, it sounded exactly like Tommy&#x2019;s unique understanding of the English language. But nothing I said would ever change his view of The Room, so what did it matter? I thought the film offered a fascinating glimpse into Tommy&#x2019;s life. But I couldn&#x2019;t imagine anyone anywhere would be able to decipher it, let alone pay money to see it.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what I think about The Room,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Why are you asking me this now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because tomorrow is very important day. It will go to the history. Touchdown. No one can take away. Our top-of-mountain day! We begin to shoot.&#x201d; He smiled and leaned back. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe this, if you really think about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Congratulations. You deserve it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tommy looked at me, his face slack. &#x201c;This &#x2018;yeah&#x2019; is not convincing. You are not happy?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was happy. I was also, at that moment, distracted. I&#x2019;d accidentally caught eyes with a young brunette across the restaurant, which I think she mistakenly took as an invitation. She and her blond friend were checking out our table. And now, suddenly, they were coming over. Dressed up, both of them. Heels, both of them. Young, both of them. The blond woman looked like an agent&#x2019;s assistant maybe meeting her slightly racier, less securely employed friend for a night of whatever they felt like they could get away with. They had sparkly eyes and hello-there smiles and were holding half-drunk glasses of wine, which were clearly not their first drinks of the evening.<br> <br>They motioned for Tommy and me to scoot in so they could join us. &#x201c;Just wanted to come over and say hey,&#x201d; the brunette said. &#x201c;Thought you were cute.&#x201d;<br> <br>We awkwardly shook hands, introduced ourselves. Greg. Tommy. Miranda. Sam. Our booth smelled like it had been hit with a precision strike of apples-and-vanilla perfume.<br> <br>Conversation, haltingly, began. Yeah, the food was great. Oh, that&#x2019;s so funny! My bare arm was touched once, twice. Tommy was glowering, backing away into some small, irritated corner of his mind. He stayed there for a bit, before, out of nowhere, he asked the girls, &#x201c;So what do you do besides drink?&#x201d;<br> <br>They exchanged a quick, decisive look. I could almost see the mischief in their eyes flicker out at the same time. &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; Miranda said.<br> <br>Tommy sighed. &#x201c;I ask what do you do? Any job or anything? What do you offer besides the vodka?&#x201d;<br> <br>Miranda looked into her wineglass questioningly, and then over at me. There was nothing I could say. Miranda and Sam stood up. Yes. Well. It was nice meeting you, Greg. Yeah, thanks. You, too. We&#x2019;ll see you around. Sure. Take care, then. Absolutely.<br> <br>After they left, I looked at Tommy and shook my head. &#x201c;Girls are crazy,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>The waiter arrived and asked to see Tommy&#x2019;s identification. This wasn&#x2019;t unusual. Our bill was huge, and Tommy was paying with his credit card, which wasn&#x2019;t reading. Tommy, however, refused to show the waiter identification, eventually announcing, &#x201c;I have a right under law of California!&#x201d; Then the waiter made it clear to Tommy that the Los Angeles Police Department was only a phone call away. Tommy got angry and allowed the waiter to glimpse his driver&#x2019;s license beneath a murky plastic lining in his wallet. The waiter said he was sorry, but Tommy had to remove the identification. &#x201c;Very disrespectful!&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry but you are completely off the wall.&#x201d; The waiter, finally, acceded.<br> <br>Tommy stormed out. I lingered behind, apologizing to every member of the staff I saw. I&#x2019;d become accustomed to this; it was how I paid for our dinners.<br> <br>Outside the Palm, we waited for the valet to drive Tommy&#x2019;s Benz around. (He had apparently forgotten about the dangers of valet farting.) I dreaded the look on the valet&#x2019;s face when Tommy tipped him. On a hundred-dollar dinner tab, Tommy would often tip five dollars. Sometimes the recipients of Tommy&#x2019;s tips would come back to him, with an air of wounded dignity, and ask, &#x201c;Have I done something wrong?&#x201d; And Tommy would say, &#x201c;Be happy with what you have.&#x201d; Tommy must have been feeling a little guilty about what went down inside the Palm, because the valet didn&#x2019;t seem scandalized by the tip Tommy gave him.<br> <br>We headed east on Santa Monica. Traffic was light, but Tommy was nevertheless driving at his standard speed of twenty miles below the legal limit. I wondered, sometimes, what drivers on the freeways of Greater Los Angeles thought when they passed Tommy. Expecting to see some centenarian crypt keeper behind the wheel, they instead saw a Cro-Magnon profile, wild black hair, and Blade Runner sunglasses.<br> <br>Coincidentally, at the first stoplight, Miranda and Sam from the Palm pulled up beside us. I looked over and smile-waved. They, of course, burst out laughing. Tommy powered down the passenger window and said, as loud as he could, &#x201c;Ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha! Ha! Ha!&#x201d; Horrified, they pulled away from the stoplight as though from a terrible accident. I sank into my seat. This was another way in which I passed the time in Tommy&#x2019;s company: trying to disappear.<br> <br>Tommy looked over at me and said, &#x201c;You look great, by the way. Like Spartacus.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tommy loved movies, though I wasn&#x2019;t sure he&#x2019;d seen anything made after 1965. I think he thought I looked like Spartacus because for the first time in my life I was wearing a beard. While working on the casting of The Room, which took months longer than it should have, I had let the beard&#x2014;along with my relationship&#x2014;just sort of go. Though Amber hated it, I&#x2019;d grown to like the beard. There was something invigoratingly Viking about it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Spartacus?&#x201d; I said. At that point, I had never seen Spartacus, but I gathered Tommy&#x2019;s observation was accurate. A few years later I finally watched it. Spartacus does not have a beard.<br> <br>The car began to roll forward again. &#x201c;So listen now,&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;This is very important. You have to do The Room.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am doing The Room.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is not what I mean. I mean you must act in The Room. Perform. You have to play Mark.&#x201d;<br> <br>We&#x2019;d been over this. Many, many times. Tommy claimed that he&#x2019;d written the part of Mark&#x2014;who in the script betrays his best friend, Johnny (Tommy&#x2019;s character), by sleeping with Johnny&#x2019;s future wife, Lisa&#x2014;for me. I was never sure how to take this.<br> <br>In the four years that I&#x2019;d known Tommy, he&#x2019;d come to my aid on numerous occasions. If it weren&#x2019;t for Tommy, I never would have moved to Los Angeles. Now he was making a film&#x2014;a film that meant the world to him. So I was happy to help him. But act in it? That was an entirely different level of obligation. I knew what good films looked like. The Room was not going to be a good film. It was probably going to require divine intervention just for Tommy to finish the thing.<br> <br>This was to say nothing of the fact that the role of Mark had already been cast.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think about this?&#x201d; Tommy asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;that Don is already playing Mark.&#x201d; The actor&#x2019;s name was Dan, but Tommy always called him Don, so I had to call him that, too.<br> <br>Tommy was quiet for a block. Gobs of oncoming headlight filled the car and withdrew. We were now traveling ten miles below Tommy&#x2019;s standard twenty miles below the speed limit, all while he veered int...</p><h2>Manners</h2><p>&#34;Aliki makes manners accessible to children through colorful cartoon-style illustrations designed to teach some of the basics....Her lively primer sparkles with examples....There&#39;s plenty to learn, plenty to look at, and plenty to share in a cleverbook that demonstrates the importance of manners while it makes learning them fun.&#34;--Booklist.</p><p>The wonderful Aliki Brandenberg has written and illustrated more children's books than many kids have read.

Heinrich Harrer, author of &#39;Seven Years in Tibet&#39; and one of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest mountaineers, was part of the team that finally conquered the Eiger&#39;s fearsome North Face in 1938. It was a landmark expedition that pitted the explorers against treacherous conditions and the limits of human endurance, and which many have since tried -- and failed -- to emulate. Armed with an intimate knowledge that comes only from first-hand experience of climbing the Eiger, Harrer gives a gripping account of physical daring and mental resilience.

Drawing on her own painful personal experiences, as well as the candid stories of those she has helped in her seminars, Roth examines the crucial issues that surround emotional eating: need for control, dependency on melodrama, desire for what is forbidden, and the belief that one wrong move can mean catastrophe. She shows why many people overeat in an attempt to satisfy their emotional hunger, and why weight loss frequently just uncovers a new set of problems.

Spreading from academia into mainstream media, the suggestion that diversity of doctrine in the early church led to many competing orthodoxies is indicative of today's postmodern relativism. Authors K�stenberger and Kruger engage Ehrman and others in this polemic against a dogged adherence to popular ideals of diversity.</p><p>K�stenberger and Kruger's accessible and careful scholarship not only counters the "Bauer Thesis" using its own terms, but also engages overlooked evidence from the New Testament. Their conclusions are drawn from analysis of the evidence of unity in the New Testament, the formation and closing of the canon, and the methodology and integrity of the recording and distribution of religious texts within the early church.</p></p><p><p><strong>Andreas J.

And the Diversity was with God, and the Diversity was God. Without Diversity was nothing made that was made. And it came to pass that nasty old 'orthodox' people narrowed down diversity and finally squeezed it out, dismissing it as heresy. But in the fullness of time (which is of course our time), Diversity rose up and smote orthodoxy hip and thigh. Now, praise be, the only heresy is orthodoxy. As widely and as unthinkingly accepted as this reconstruction is, it is historical nonsense: the emperor has no clothes. I am grateful to Andreas K�stenberger and Michael Kruger for patiently, carefully, and politely exposing this shameful nakedness for what it is."<br>&#x2015;<strong>D. A. Carson,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; Cofounder, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>"<em>The Heresy of Orthodoxy</em> will help many to make sense of what is happening in early Christian studies today. It explains, critiques, and provides an alternative to, the so-called 'Bauer Thesis,' an approach which undergirds a large segment of scholarship on early Christianity. The 'doctrine' that Christianity before the fourth century was but a seething mass of diverse and competing factions, with no theological center which could claim historical continuity with Jesus and his apostles, has become the new 'orthodoxy' for many. The authors of this book do more than expose the faults of this doctrine, they point the way to a better foundation for early Christian studies, focusing on the cornerstone issues of the canon and the text of the New Testament. Chapter 8, which demonstrates how one scholar's highly-publicized twist on New Testament textual criticism only tightens the tourniquet on his own views, is alone worth the price of the book. K�stenberger and Kruger have done the Christian reading public a real service."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Charles E. Hill,</strong> John R. Richardson Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity, Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando</p><p>"The Bauer thesis, taken up in many university circles and popularized by Bart Ehrman and through TV specials, has long needed a thorough examination. <em>The Heresy of Orthodoxy</em> is that work. Whether looking at Bauer's thesis of diversity, at contemporary use made of the theory to argue for the early origin of Gnosticism, at the process that led to the canon, or what our manuscript evidence is, this study shows that Bauer's theory, though long embraced, is full of problems that need to be faced. What emerges from this study is an appreciation that some times new theories are not better than what they seek to replace, despite the hype that often comes from being the new kid on the block. It is high time this kid be exposed as lacking the substance of a genuinely mature view. This book does that well, and also gives a fresh take on what the alternative is that has much better historical roots."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Darrell L. Bock,</strong> Executive Director of Cultural Engagement, The Hendricks Center, Dallas Theological Seminary</p><p>"This is an admirably lucid and highly convincing rebuttal of the thesis that the earliest form of Christianity in many places was what would later be judged as 'heresy' and that earliest Christianity was so diverse that it should not be considered as a single movement&#x2015;a thesis first presented by Walter Bauer but most recently advocated by Bart Ehrman. As K�stenberger and Kruger show with such clarity and compelling force, this still highly influential thesis simply does not stand up to scrutiny. By looking at a whole range of evidence&#x2015;early Christian communities in different regions in the Roman Empire, the New Testament documents themselves, the emergence and boundaries of the canon and its connection to covenant, and the evidence for Christian scribes and the reliable transmission of the text of the New Testament&#x2015;they show step by step that another view of early Christianity is much more in keeping with the evidence. That is, that there is a unified doctrinal core in the New Testament, as well as a degree of legitimate diversity, and that the sense of orthodoxy among New Testament writers is widespread and pervasive. They also unmask the way contemporary culture has been mesmerized by diversity and the impact this has had on some readers of the New Testament. In this astute and highly readable book&#x2015;a tour de force&#x2015;K�stenberger and Kruger have done us all a great service. It is essential reading for all who want to understand the New Testament and recent controversies that have arisen in New Testament Studies." <br>&#x2015;<strong>Paul Trebilco,</strong> Professor of New Testament Studies, University of Otago, New Zealand</p><p>"K�stenberger and Kruger have written a book which not only introduces the reader to the problematic Bauer thesis and its contemporary resurgence, but which, layer by layer, demonstrates its failure to account reliably for the history of communities, texts, and ideas which flourished in the era of early Christianity. In their arguments, the authors demonstrate their competence in the world of New Testament studies. But, additionally, they weave throughout the book insights into how fallacies within contemporary culture provide fuel for a thesis which long ago should have been buried. Believers will find in these pages inspiration to 'contend earnestly for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.'"<br>&#x2015;<strong>D. Jeffrey Bingham</strong>, Department Chair and Professor of Theological Studies, Dallas Theological Seminary</p><p>"In recent times, certain media darlings have been telling us that earliest Christianity knew nothing of the 'narrowness' of orthodox belief. Now the authors of <em>The Heresy of Orthodoxy</em> have provided a scholarly yet highly accessible rebuttal, showing that what is actually 'narrow' here is the historical evidence on which this old thesis is based. In a culture which wants to recreate early Christianity after its own stultifying image, this book adds a much-needed breath of balance and sanity."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nicholas Perrin,</strong> Dean, Wheaton College Graduate School</p><p>"K�stenberger and Kruger have produced a volume that is oozing with common sense and is backed up with solid research and documentation. This work is a comprehensive critique of the Bauer-Ehrman thesis that the earliest form of Christianity was pluralistic, that there were multiple Christianities, and that heresy was prior to orthodoxy. Respectful yet without pulling any punches, <em>The Heresy of Orthodoxy</em> at every turn makes a convincing case that the Bauer-Ehrman thesis is dead wrong. All those who have surrendered to the siren song of postmodern relativism and tolerance, any who are flirting with it, and everyone concerned about what this seismic sociological-epistemological shift is doing to the Christian faith should read this book."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Daniel B.

Any reader wondering how our economy got to where it is today will find this a refreshing overview."&nbsp;--<b>Timothy W. Guinnane</b>, Philip Golden Bartlett Professor of Economic History, Yale University<i>&nbsp;</i><br>"[<i>Economix</i>] brings a lively visual sensibility to this intensely abstruse subject matter without condescending to the reader or dumbing the ideas down." --MotherJones.com<br><b>"</b>This witty and elegant volume takes on a number of complex issues--in this case, economics, history and finance--and makes them comprehensible for mere mortals." --<i>Miami Herald </i><br><br>"It's simply phenomenal. You could read ten books on the subject and not glean as much information."&nbsp;-- <b>David Bach</b> founder of FinishRich Media; author of nine <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Debt Free for Life</i> and <i>The Automatic Millionaire</i><br><br>"Goodwin has done the seemingly impossible--he has made economics comprehensible <i>and</i> funny."--<b>Joel Bakan</b>, author of <i>The Corporation</i>: <i>The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power</i><br><br>"An amazing lesson in true-world economics!

The bonus: Who would have guessed that economics could be fun, and--here's the joy--really accessible? Goodwin roots us in history and fills us with common sense understanding. As he puts it early on, economics seems horribly complicated mostly because we're looking at it all at once. Broken down into its component pieces, it's relatively easy to understand. And a good understanding of economics is critical to maneuvering in the world today. If I were compiling a list of the 100 most important books you can read in a lifetime, this would be on it."&nbsp;--<b>Stephen Petranek</b>, editor-in-chief, Weider History magazines, former editor-in-chief of <i>Discover</i> magazine<br><br>"Through a potent mix of comics and punchy, concise, accessible prose, Goodwin takes us on a provocative, exhaustively researched, and exceedingly engaging trip through our history and present day, creating an alternately hilarious and scary picture of where we are today as an economy<b>-- </b>and what it all means. More than that, Goodwin makes the arcane, understandable. If your mind either spins or slumbers at the thought of economics, read Goodwin's <i>Economix</i> and all will become clear.&nbsp;<b>--</b><b>Nomi Prins</b>, author of <i>It Takes a Pillage: An Epic Tale of Power, Deceit, and Untold Trillions</i></p><p><b>Michael Goodwin</b> is a writer and editor with a degree in Chinese studies.

The British Army is approaching, and the Indians in the area seem ready to attack. To Stands Straight, a young Abenaki Indian scouting for King George, Americans are dangerous enemies who threaten his family and home. When Stands Straight's party enters the Quaker Meetinghouse where Samuel worships, the two boys share an encounter that neither will ever forget. Told in alternating viewpoints, <i>The Arrow over the Door</i> is based on a true story. <br><br>Illustrated by James Watling.<br><br>"Thoughtful and eminently readable." (<i>School Library Journal</i>)</p><p>Joseph Bruchac is a highly acclaimed children&#39;s book author, poet, novelist and storyteller, as well as a scholar of Native American culture. Coauthor with Michael Caduto of the bestselling Keepers of the Earth series, Bruchac&#39;s poems, articles and stories have appeared in hundreds of publications, from Akwesasne Notes and American Poetry Review to National Geographic and Parabola. He has authored many books for adults and children including Code Talker: A Novel About the Navajo Marines of World War Two, Skeleton Man, and The Heart of a Chief. For more information about Joseph, please visit his website www.josephbruchac.com.Gr. 4^-7. Fourteen-year-old Samuel Russell hates being called a coward because he is a Quaker, and he vows to defend his family if Loyalists or Indians try to harm them. Stands Straight, an Abenaki boy whose mother and brother were murdered by white men, has joined his uncle's scouting party, though he questions why Indians should fight in the white man's war. In alternating narratives, the two boys tell this quietly compelling story, which is based on an actual incident that took place in 1777, just before the Battle of Saratoga. As Samuel's family sits in the meeting with the rest of the Quaker congregation, the Indian scouting party to which Stands Straight belongs surrounds the cabin. Stands Straight follows his uncle Sees-the-Wind inside, and after being assured that there are no weapons in the cabin, the Abenakis leave their bows and arrows outside and sit with the Quakers in silence. At the end of the meeting, the Quakers and the Indians share the handshake of peace, and Sees-the-Wind places an arrow over the cabin's door to show the Abenakis that the Quakers are people of peace. Simple black-and-white drawings reflect the dignified tone of the story, which explores the complexities of the Indian-white relationship, focusing on two lesser-known groups who were involved in the conflict. An author's note provides thorough historical background about the incident, as well as a brief history of the Quakers and the Abenakis. A truly excellent example of historical fiction for the middle-grade/junior-high audience. <i>Karen Hutt</i></p><h2>Reappearing Church: The Hope for Renewal in the Rise of Our Post-Christian Culture</h2><p><p><b><i>What if the rise of secularism is good news for the church?</i></b></p><p>For decades, we set our hopes on technology, politics, and the appearance of peace.

Many proposed solutions have been helpful, but these only take us so far. Adding to this complex situation is the reality that Christians of different races see the issues differently. Sociologist George Yancey surveys a range of approaches to racial healing that Christians have used and offers a new model for moving forward. The first part of the book analyzes four secular models regarding race used by Christians (colorblindness, Anglo-conformity, multiculturalism and white responsibility) and shows how each has its own advantages and limitations. Part two offers a new &#34;mutual responsibility&#34; model, which acknowledges that both majority and minority cultures have their own challenges, tendencies, and sins to repent of, and that people of different races approach racial reconciliation and justice in differing but complementary ways. Yancey&#39;s vision offers hope that people of all races can walk together on a shared path--not as adversaries, but as partners.</p><p><strong>George Yancey</strong> (Ph.D., University of Texas) is associate professor of sociology at the University of North Texas, specializing in race/ethnicity and biracial families.

This book is useful not only for casual readers who wish to develop a broader perspective on the issue of racism but also for seminary courses on race relations. (Missiology, July 2007)<br><br>If pastors and lay leaders were to read this book and humbly take its principles to heart, we could see a change in race relations in this country, and our churches could be a multiracial witness to the world of reconciliation, healing and grace. (Greg Bowman, Baptist Standard, February 5, 2007)<br><br>"George Yancey has taken the complexity of the racial issue and has distilled it into a clear and comprehensive diagnosis. The best part about his work is that he gives us the ultimate solution that attacks the race problem at its core. Anyone who wants to have a serious discussion about racial issues in American culture must crack open this book!" (David Anderson, Founder and Senior Pastor of Bridgeway Community Church, President of BridgeLeader Network, and nationally syndicated radio talk show host)<br><br>"In <em>Beyond Racial Gridlock,</em> George Yancey once again challenges us to think in fresh ways about the ministry of reconciliation. His assessment of the pros and cons of current strategies is extremely helpful in understanding the present state of racial reconciliation. Yancey's creative thinking further leads the reader to examine racism and the need of reconciliation in new ways using a central premise from an ancient source--the Bible. This book is a much-needed resource for pastors, students, professors, laypersons and others who hunger for a united church in a divided world." (Curtiss Paul DeYoung, associate professor of reconciliation studies, Bethel University, and author of Coming Together)<br><br>"I am so drawn to this book. It gets me beyond my guilt, denial and defensiveness. Yancey, as a black man, is coming along beside me, a white man, and acknowledging that this is our mutual task to figure out how to treat one another well. I don't feel condemned; I feel welcomed into a conversation. What a winsome and inviting way of framing the racial divide in our country." (Mark R. McMinn, Rech Professor of Psychology, Wheaton College, and author of Finding Our Way Home)<br><br>"A much-needed book! George Yancey proposes to do what is long overdue--systematically analyze race and race relations to suggest a thoughtful Christian approach to racial problems. And I cannot think of a better person to write this book. Dr. Yancey has been working in the area of race relations for many years, written several influential books on the subject and knows how to write readable, to-the-point books for Christians."

He draws people eating at Taco Bell, admiring paintings at the Museum of Modern Art, and sleeping on the subway. With a foreword by Kristen Wiig, <em>Every Person in New York, Volume 1</em> collects thousands of Polan's energetic drawings in one chunky book. As full as a phone book and as invigorating as a walk down a bustling New York street, this is a new kind of love letter to a beloved city and the people who live there.</p><p>Jason Polan is an illustrator whose work has been published in the <em>New Yorker</em>, <em>Metropolis</em> magazine, and in the <em>New York Times</em> as part of a weekly column. He has exhibited work internationally and has also drawn every piece of art in the Museum of Modern Art, twice. He lives in New York, of course.&#x201c;In 2008, Jason Polan set himself the challenge of drawing every person in New York. Like Sufjan Stevens&#x2019;s aim to make 50 albums of the United States, it was essentially an impossible project, but what&#x2019;s come out of it is undoubtedly a success. The artist and Cut collaborator has drawn an impressive 36,000-plus people to date, and those sketches are all compiled in<em> Every Person in New York,</em> along with a foreword by Kristen Wiig. It&#x2019;s out on August 18, with a key addendum to its title:<em> Volume 1.</em> Thumb through a copy to find sketches and scrawled captions of New Yorkers waiting in line, subway riders, famous faces, and, if you&#x2019;ve been to New York City in the last seven years, maybe even yourself.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><em>New York magazine</em></b><br><br>&#x201c;In 2008, illustrator Jason Polan set out to capture the enormous human poetics compressed in Gotham&#x2019;s geographic smallness by drawing every person in the city. The first seven years of this ongoing project, totaling drawings of 30,000 people, are now collected in<em> Every Person in New York</em>&#x2014;a marvelous tome of Polan&#x2019;s black-and-white line drawings, colored in with the intense aliveness of a city where, as E.B. White wrote more than half a century earlier, &#x2018;wonderful events are taking place every minute.&#x2019; What emerges is a kind of poetry&#x2014;fragmentary glimpses of ideas and images, commanded by an internal rhythm to paint a complete whole of this human hive.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><em>Brain Pickings</em></b><br><br>&#x201d;Jason Polan&#x2019;s drawings exude, in unbroken but flexible lines, the momentum of a Manhattan streetscape with only brief moments of stillness. Those pauses can last minutes or over an hour, enough time for fully textured, impressionistic portraits. But more often Mr. Polan&#x2019;s drawings are of scenes that pass in seconds: a father ordering hot dogs for his stubborn children, or Diane Keaton trying to hail a cab.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><em>The New York Times</em></b><br><br>&#x201c;This digest of sketches brings to life the everyday moments of New Yorkers and finds a spark of excitement in the sometimes-banal shuffle of city living.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><em>Monocle magazine</em></b><br><br>&#x201c;In 400+ pages and 30,000 people, Jason Polan presents a big-hearted and humanistic picture of the city.

D. Wilson is a Fellow of Literature at New Saint Andrews College, where he teaches classical rhetoric to freshmen. He married a girl stolen from the ocean, and the two of them now live in Idaho with their four children.<p>In the&nbsp;history of the world there have been lots of onces and lots of times, and every time has had a once upon it. Most people will tell you that the once upon a time happened in a land far, far away, but it really depends on where you are. The once upon a time&nbsp;may have been just outside your back door. It may have been beneath your very feet. It might not have been in a land at all but deep in the sea's belly or bobbing around on its back.<br> In this case it was in a land, for the most part. If you know of a valley where a small mountain peak once shaped like a crescent moon has tumbled down and disturbed the old willow trees growing beside a slow stream, then this story does not begin far, far away, and you've probably already heard it. But if you, like me, had to&nbsp;be told about this valley and the stream and the old, dry house chained to the top of the enormous rock beside the foot of the mountain, then this story does begin once upon a time in a land most definitely far, far away. Anyone close to this valley is sure to have heard of it.<br> Our story had already begun when the dust-covered delivery truck found the gravel road leading into the valley and followed it to its end beside the old willow rock. Two men got out and glared at the wooden stairs that crawled up to the house.<br> "Don't know what sort of people would build up there," the driver muttered.<br> "People who liked rocks, maybe. Or views."<br> "Or stairs."<br> Thomas Hammond, who was down by the stream with a red plastic cup full of leeches, heard them and turned to&nbsp;watch. They fished the large refrigerator box out of the back of the truck and strapped thick belts beneath thicker bellies, preparing to tote it to the top, two more deliverymen in a long history of delivery-men who would sweat and curse their way up the&nbsp;long, curving stairs. Finally, at the top, his mother greeted them and held the kitchen door open as they squeezed the box inside.<br> Tom had traveled around the sun eleven times when the delivery truck brought his mother's newest fridge, but a number doesn't really describe his age. His father had been gone for three years, and that made him feel older. He was the sort of boy who had many friends when he was at school, but what they knew about him was limited to his freckles, brown hair, long arms, and theclenched determination that settled onto his face when he was angry or competing. His smile, which was wide and quick, was always surprising, and his laugh, which lived in his narrow belly, was unpredictable. In games, any games, he was the first to dive&nbsp;for a ball, to slide on concrete, or to get a mouthful of dirt. He was taller than many of the boys in his class, but not the tallest, and he always seemed to have scabs.<br> Wait for the rest of the story, and you will know him better when I am done.<br> People&nbsp;thought Tom's house was chained to the top of the rock for a reason. Some said the first house in the valley had been built down by the stream and that the spring floods had washed it away. The second house, they said, had been built on top of the rock, but one of the big summer thunderstorms had blown it off. So the third house had been chained to spikes bored deep into the stone. But no one really knew why or when the house had been built, only that it&nbsp;<br> was there now and it had stayed put through life-times, though occasional electrical surges were hard on lightbulbs and appliances. The lightbulbs were easy to replace and the appliances were usually under warranty, so Tom's mother, Elizabeth, didn't mind. She didn't have to carry the new ones up the stairs.<br> When the truck had gone and the dust had settled, Tom dumped forty-seven confused leeches onto the bank, where he thought the birds would find them and be pleasantly surprised. Cup in hand, he jumped through the long grass and ran up the stairs to look&nbsp;at his mother's shiny new refrigeration. At the top he found the box. It was lying on its side, carefully arranged and waiting for him. He bent over and looked in. A long brick of white foam filled the bottom, and a small stack of cookies sat on it, allthe way at the end. Why? Tom wondered. Why does she think I still want to play in boxes?<br> Tom got down on his knees and retrieved the cookies. Back on his feet, he ate thoughtfully as he kicked at the fridge box and watched it skid across the rock. He kicked again, and the box tumbled down the rock and out onto the breeze. Tom watched plastic packing bags slip out, followed by the large piece of foam. The box bounced in the gravel drive and rolled into the long grass, but the foam floated nicely, clearing the first willow trees. The plastic bags disappeared.<br> "Hey!" his mother called from inside. "You'd better get that all picked up before some duck chokes on it! Come in and see the fridge!"<br> "We don't have ducks," Tom said. He stared at the last cookie in his hand, counted the chocolate chips, and then slid the whole thing into his mouth.<br> It was a nice fridge, too big for the corner of the kitchen where it would live out its electrically dangerous life. It was black and shiny, in sharp contrast to the dingy&nbsp;kitchen, and it had water and ice in the door. The last two fridges had both had the water and ice dispensers in the door but had never dispensed either one. They wouldn't work without a water line, and a water line had never been run.<br> "Well, you can head&nbsp;back out," Elizabeth said when the tour was over. "Try not to be too long, though. Jeffrey is coming to dinner, and I'll need help setting." She gave him half of a wide smile. "And see if you can track down all that trash you just spread through the valley."<br> She pushed her blond hair behind her ears and turned back to the pile of potato peels in the kitchen sink. Tom stood at the door, looking back at his tall, slender mother with her hands full of potato. He usually liked to watch his mother cook, but he&nbsp;didn't like watching her cook for Jeffrey.<br> &nbsp;<br><br></p></p><h2>Building Foundations of Scientific Understanding: A Science Curriculum for K-8 and Older Beginning Science Learners, 2nd Ed. Vol. I, Grades K-2</h2><p>Building Foundations of Scientific Understanding (BFSU) - BFSU is for teachers, homeschoolers, and other educators to deliver a first-rate science education to K-8 students and older beginning-science learners. Vol. I (here) is for grades K-2 and older beginning-science learners. Volumes II and III are for grades 3-5, and 6-8, and older progressing science learners. BFSU provides both teaching methodologies and detailed lesson plans embracing and integrating all the major areas of science. BFSU lessons follow structured learning progressions that build knowledge and develop understanding in systematic incremental steps. BFSU lessons all center around hands-on experience and real-world observations. In turn, they draw students to exercise their minds in thinking and drawing rational conclusions from what they observe/experience. Therefore, in following BFSU, students will be guided toward conceptual understanding of crosscutting concepts and ideas of science, as well as factual knowledge, and they will develop mind skills of scientific thinking and logical reasoning in the process. Implementing BFSU requires no particular background in either science or teaching. Teachers/parents can learn along with their children and be excellent role models in doing so. Already widely used and acclaimed in its 1st edition form, this second edition of BFSU contains added elements that will make it more useful in bringing students to master the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).</p><p>A life interest and pursuit of science, including an A.B from Earlham College and Ph.D. from Duke University, and a passion for teaching (Catonsville Community College) led Dr. Nebel to write one of the early and highly successful Environmental Science texts. In turn, Nebel recognized the need for more substantial elementary level science education. These highly regarded BFSU volumes (see reviews of 1st edition on Amazon and elsewhere) are the result.

William Boyd's novel <i>Any Human Heart</i> is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling "my personal rollercoaster"--or rather, "not so much a rollercoaster", but a yo-yo, "a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child." From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism and abject poverty. <p> Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere author William Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall <i>Any Human Heart</i> is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness. <i>--Alan Stewart</i>, Amazon.co.uk</p><b>Praise from England for <i>Any Human Heart<br></i></b><i><br></i>"A work of astonishing ventriloquistic virtuosity . . . A brilliant evocation of a past era . . . One finds oneself almost reading the journals as genuine . . . which is quite a feat, because Boyd has skillfully mimicked the artless and random qualities of every diary."<br>- Caroline Moore, <i>Sunday Telegraph<br><br></i>"A book full of delights . . . No one is better than William Boyd at drawing the reader into [a] tale from the very first sentence."<br>- Erica Wagner, <i>The Times<br><br></i>"An excellent picaresque novel, written in a confident, easy-going style . . . <i>Any Human Heart</i> is an old-fashioned, new-fangled tour de force which maintains its brio to the very end. An obvious contender for the next round of literary prizes, it would be considered a worthy and genuinely popular winner of any one of them."<br>- Anita Brookner,<i> The Spectator<br><br></i>"Boyd's terrific powers of storytelling are given free rein here: this is a biography where you don't know the ending, and he keeps you glued and guessing . . . One of Boyd's most enjoyable novels to date: generous, witty and sneakily profound."<br>- Catherine Shoard, <i>Evening Standard<br><br></i>"Compelling . . . An addictively enjoyable read as well as a testament to the endurance of the human heart."<br>- Geordie Grieg, <i>Literary Review<br><br></i>"Astounding. . .The most sincere measure of praise one can attach to William Boyd's new novel is that it ranks alongside <i>The New Confessions</i> as one of his great achievements . . . It also resembles the earlier book in its ambition and spirit, being an account of tumultuous tragicomic life that lasts from one end of the twentieth century to the other. To pull off that trick once is considerable: to do it twice is astounding." <br>&#x2013; Anthony Quinn, <i>The Mail on Sunday<br><br></i></p><h2>International Organizations: The Politics and Processes of Global Governance</h2><p>The third edition of the award-winning&nbsp;International Organizations&nbsp;has been thoroughly revised and updated to take into account new developments and shifting power relations since 2009, as well as the most current scholarship.

Desperate to clear his name--and expose the conspirators in the White House--Quinn must race against time before McKeon can execute his evil plan.

Cameron presently lives in the Pacific Northwest with his wife and BMW motorcycle.In Cameron's uninspired sixth Jericho Quinn novel (after 2015's Day Zero), "warmongering moles" President Hartman Drake and Vice President Lee McKeon have entered the White House after both their predecessors were assassinated. Now, "very day another politician, reporter, or military officer who opposed the new administration in even the most trivial matters found themselves harassed or taken into custody" by Drake and McKeon's Internal Defense Task Force. Quinn, an agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, is among those on the run from the IDTF; he's allied with a number of former senior officials, including the CIA director and the secretary of state, aiming to topple the Drake-McKeon regime. Meanwhile, a dangerous new kind of thermobaric bomb that the Chinese have been developing has been stolen. The conceit�&#x20ac;&#x201d;that the two people at the top of the executive branch are connected with terrorists�&#x20ac;&#x201d;will strain credulity, and Cameron doesn't compensate with either clever plotting or full-blooded characters.

Oddly, I don't remember much of what I wrote about my life, but I do remember how I died: in first place on the final lap of the Daytona 500. At the time, I hadn't considered writing as an occupation, a field with a remarkably low on-the-job casualty rate.</p><p>What intrigues me most about Mrs. Johnson's assignment is the opportunity she gave us to confront our own legacy. How do we want to be remembered? That question has motivated our species since the beginning of time: from building pyramids to putting our names on skyscrapers.</p><p>As I began to write this book, I had two objectives: First, I wanted to explore what could happen if someone read their obituary before they died and saw, firsthand, what the world really thought of them. Their legacy.</p><p>Second, I wanted to write a Christmas story of true redemption. One of my family's holiday traditions is to see a local production of Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. I don't know how many times I've seen it (perhaps a dozen), but it still thrills me to see the change that comes over Ebenezer Scrooge as he transforms from a dull, tight-fisted miser into a penitent, "giddy-as-aschoolboy" man with love in his heart. I always leave the show with a smile on my face and a resolve to be a better person. That's what I wanted to share with you, my dear readers, this Christmas -- a holiday tale to warm your season, your homes, and your hearts.</p><p>Merry Christmas --<i>Richard Paul Evans</i></p></p><p><p>To the reader from Richard Paul Evans: "As I began to write this book, I had two objectives: First, I wanted to explore what could happen if someone read their obituary before they died and saw, firsthand, what the world really thought of them.

The clues are confounding. But with Koko&#x2019;s help, Qwill intends to catch a thief&#x2014;and a killer...</p><p>Lillian Jackson Braun never seems to run out of ideas for her popular series of mysteries featuring journalist Jim Qwilleran and his feline cohort, Koko. In this latest, <i>The Cat Who Tailed A Thief</i>, Koko again exhibits his preternatural intelligence by trying to tip off Qwilleran to important clues to a murder. That Qwilleran is not possessed of the same mental acuity as his cat is what makes this series work. Braun may not be noted for refined prose, perceptive characterizations, or stunningly original plots, but what she does do well is cats. Fans of felines in general and Koko in particular will find this book, the 19th in the Qwilleran series, almost as irresistible as, well, catnip. Some would even say it's purr-fect.The history of <b>Lilian Jackson Braun</b> is perhaps as exciting and mysterious as her novels. Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series. Braun passed away in 2011.</p><h2>The Doll&#39;s House</h2><p>From Rumer Godden, one of the foremost authors of the 20th century, and illustrated by two-time Caldecott Honor recipient Tasha Tudor, comes a heartwarming tale filled with imagination and creativity that is ideal for any girl who has ever loved a doll so much that it has become real to her.<br><br>For Tottie Plantaganet, a little wooden doll, belonging to Emily and Charlotte Dane is wonderful.

In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Miri Rubin provides an exploration of the variety, change, dynamism, and sheer complexity that the period covers. From the provinces of the Roman Empire, which became Barbarian kingdoms after c.450-650, to the northern and eastern regions that became increasingly integrated into Europe, Rubin explores the emergence of a truly global system of communication, conquest, and trade by the end of the era. <br><br>Presenting an insight into the challenges of life in Europe between 500-1500 -- at all levels of society -- Rubin looks at kingship and family, agriculture and trade, groups and individuals. Conveying the variety of European experiences, while providing a sense of the communication, cooperation, and shared values of the pervasive Christian culture, Rubin looks at the legacies they left behind.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

In a culture where bodies of people who are brown, black, female, transgender, disabled, fat, or queer are often shamed, sexualized, ignored, and oppressed, what does it mean to live in a marginalized body? Through theory, personal narrative, and artistic expression, this anthology explores how power, privilege, oppression, and attempted disembodiment play out on the bodies of disparaged individuals and what happens when the body&#x2019;s expression is stereotyped and stunted. Bringing together a range of voices, this book offers strategies and practices for embodiment and activism and considers what it means to be an embodied ally to anyone experiencing bodily oppression.</p><p>LUCIA BENNETT LEIGHTON, MA, LPCC, R-DMT, has a master&#x2019;s degree from Naropa University&#x2019;s Somatic Counseling Psychology program.

What can you see in the eye of a hurricane? What's the difference between a thunderbolt and a thunderclap? Popular author and artist Eric Sloane proves why weather is something best understood by seeing it. His illustrated book shows weather "happening." In fact, there's not a sunny page in it&#x2014;nothing but cyclonic storms, whirlwinds, waterspouts, lightning bolts, and other fascinating, weather-related topics. More than seventy pages of drawings and diagrams make the weather come alive in a book that examines everything from storm mechanisms and cold fronts to the birth of a thunderhead. <br>A valuable resource for learning more about everyone's favorite topic for conversation and speculation, Eric Sloane&#x2014;the "Weather Wizard"&#x2014;has the countryman's simple and natural comprehension to give substance to his scientific and artistic insights. What especially distinguishes this volume from his other books on the subject is the focus on a detailed treatment of the more spectacular and destructive elements of weather phenomena. His belief is that if this book "gets one to look upward more often, it will have accomplished a purpose."</p><p>Sloane, born in New York City and educated at Yale, most of his life has been spent in New England, where he has combined a fascinating range of interests into a colorful and highly successful career, primarily as author-illustrator of more than 24 books on American history, arts, and artifacts.</p><h2>The Three Marks of Manhood: How to be Priest, Prophet and King of Your Family</h2><p>Dr. G.C. Dilsaver writes that the time has come for Catholic families to re-discover true patriarchy--time for Catholic men to accept and fulfill their role as leader and head of their families. The role of Christian manhood, as ordained by God and confirmed by Catholic teaching, is symbolized by three staffs: the Scepter of authority and self-discipline, the Crosier of spiritual headship, and the Cross of redemptive suffering.&nbsp; Dr. Dilsaver promotes a new and untainted patriarchy in which the husband's ultimate authority is rooted in Christ's example of humility and self-sacrificing love.Three Marks of Manhood can help Christian families realize their identity to the fullest--empowering them to resist the encroachment of secular culture. Read it and learn how to build a strong and lasting marriage, raise children to become faithful men and women of God, and foster an authentic Catholic culture in your home.</p><p><b>See GC Dilsaver's new book, <i>CELEBRATING GOD-GIVEN GENDER: MASCULINITY &amp; FEMININITY PER NATURE &amp; GRACE</i>, which takes up where <i>Three Marks of Manhood</i> left off! </b><b>Dr. G.C. Dilsaver</b>, having been deemed the very "father of Christian psychology," has subsequently developed <i>Psychomoralitics</i> as an antidotal alternative to the mental health professions.In addition to Dr. Dilsaver's doctorate in clinical psychology he also has a master in the theology and ethics of marriage and family and a degree in philosophy.</p><h2>Cold Hand in Mine</h2><p><i>Cold Hand in Mine</i> was first published in the U.K. in 1975 and in the U.S. in 1977. The story 'Pages from a Young Girl's Journal' won the Aickman World Fantasy Award in 1975. It was originally published in <i>The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</i> in 1973 before appearing in this collection.<br><br><i>Cold Hand in Mine</i> stands as one of Aickman's best collections and contains eight stories that show off his powers as a 'strange story' writer to the full, being more ambiguous than standard ghost stories. Throughout the stories the reader is introduced to a variety of characters, from a man who spends the night in a Hospice to a German aristocrat and a woman who sees an image of her own soul. There is also a nod to the conventional vampire story ('Pages from a Young Girl's Journal') but all the stories remain unconventional and inconclusive, which perhaps makes them all the more startling and intriguing.</p><p>Robert Fordyce Aickman was born in 1914 in London. He was married to Edith Ray Gregorson from 1941 to 1957. In 1946 the couple, along with Tom and Angela Rolt, set up the Inland Waterways Association to preserve the canals of Britain. In 1951 Aickman, along with Elizabeth Jane Howard, published his first ghost stories entitled &#34;We Are the Dark.&#34; Aickman went on to publish eleven more volumes of horror stories as well as two fantasy novels and two volumes of autobiography. He also edited the first eight volumes of &#34;The Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories.&#34; He died in February 1981.'Of all the authors of uncanny tales, Aickman is the best ever . . .

For over twenty years, Walt helped breathe life into the new golden age of animation with these teachings at the Walt Disney Animation Studios and influenced such talented artists as Tim Burton, Brad Bird, Glen Keane, and John Lasseter. These writings represent the quintessential refresher for fine artists and film professionals, and it is a vital tutorial for students who are now poised to be part of another new generation in the art form. <br><br>* Legendary lessons from the master Disney animator who put the wiggle in Jessica Rabbit's walk!<br>* Packed full of illustrations from some of the top animators in the world including Brad Bird, Glen Keane and John Lasseter<br>* Two volumes and 800 pages of pure gold - offers in-depth advice and instruction on bringing characters to life <p></p> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><p><b><b>Sample Pages from <i>Drawn to Life: 20 Golden Years of Disney Master Classes, Volume 2</i></b></b></p><i>(Click images for larger versions)</i> </td></tr><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></p><p><p>For nearly thirty years, the artists that passed through the gates of Disney Animation, and even non-artists like myself, were influenced by the craft, skill, wisdom, writings and sketches of Walt Stanchfield.</p> <p><i>Roy Disney</i></p> <p>Walt was a kind of Mark Twain for us at Disney. He always taught with humor and skill. You learned to see the world through his eyes. I remember him one day encouraging us to leap into our drawings with boldness and confidence, "Don't be afraid to make a mistake. We all have 10,000 bad drawings in us so the sooner you get them out the better!" Sitting in Walt's class was as much a psychology course as it was a drawing class. One couldn't help walk away with your mind and soul a little more open than when you entered. </p> <p><i>Glen Keane, Walt Disney Animation Studios</i></p> <p>Walt Stanchfield's classes and writings were little distillations of the man: quirky, strongly stated in a genial voice, and brimming with a lifetime of sharp observations about story telling and graphic communication. Whether he drew with a ball point pen or painted with a brush dipped in his coffee cup, he got to the essence of things and was eager to share what he learned to his eager disciples, myself among them. He was grizzled and he was great and proof that there was more than one Walt at the Disney Studio that could inspire a legion of artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><i>John Musker, Walt Disney Animation Studios</i></p> <p>Walt Stanchfield was one of Disney Animation's national treasures. His classes and notes have inspired countless animation artists, and his approach to drawing of caricature over reality, feeling over rote accuracy, and communication over&nbsp;photographic reproduction gets to the heart of what great animation is all about. Huzzah to Don Hahn for putting it all together for us!</p> <p><i>Eric Goldberg, Walt Disney Animation Studios</i></p> <p>During the Animation Renaissance of the 1990s, one of the Walt Disney Studio's best kept secrets was Walt Stanchfield. Once a week after work, this aged but agile figure jumped from drawing board to drawing board, patiently teaching us the principles behind the high baroque style of Walt Disney Animation drawing. Being in a room with Walt made you feel what it must have been like to have been taught by Don Graham. Having one of your life drawings be good enough to be reproduced in one of his little homemade weekly bulletins was akin to getting a Distinguished Service medal! Senior animators vied with trainees for that distinction.</p> <p><i>Tom Sito, Animator/Filmmaker/Author of Drawing The Line: The Untold Story of the Animation Unions from Bosko to Bart Simpson</i></p> <p>This exciting collection of master classes by the great teacher Walt Stanchfield is destined to become a classic on the order of Kimon Nicolaides' exploration of the drawing process. Stanchfield (1919-2000) inspired several generations of Disney animators and those of us outside the studio fortunate enough to happen upon dog-eared copies of his conversational notes, which we passed around like Leonardo's Codex Leicester. Stanchfield beautifully communicates the essence and joy of expressing ideas through the graphic line and accumulating a visual vocabulary. DRAWN TO LIFE is a treasure trove of cogent, valuable information for students, teachers and anyone who loves to draw.</p> <p><i>John Canemaker, NYU professor and Academy Award-winning animation filmmaker</i></p> <p>Walt Stanchfield, in his own unique way, taught so many of us about drawing, caricature, motion, acting and animation. Most important to me, was how Walt made you apply what you had observed in his life drawing class to your animation. Disney Animation is based on real life, and in that regard Walt Stanchfield's philosophy echoed Walt Disney's:</p> <p>'We cannot caricature and animate anything convincingly until we study the real thing first.'</p> <p><i>Andreas Deja, Walt Disney Animation Studios</i></p> <p>Walt Stanchfield's renewed emphasis on draftsmanship at the Disney Studios transformed the seemingly moribund art of animation. His students were part of a renaissance with The Little Mermaid and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a renaissance that continues with films ranging from The Iron Giant to Lilo and Stitch to Wall-E.</p> <p><i>Charles Solomon, Animation Historian</i></p> <p>I'm so grateful to Focal Press for publishing these fabulous Walt Stanchfield books. They are veritable 'gold dust' for the serious (and aspiring) animator! So 'hurrah' to Focal and 'hurrah' to Don Hahn to committing himself to compiling them. I ordered my copies the minute I saw them and will of course hope my students are smart enough to do so too!&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Tony White, DigiPen, Author of 'Animation: From Pencil to Pixels' and 'How to Make Animated Films'</i></p></p><h2>Assessment Tools for Recreational Therapy and Related Fields, 4th Edition</h2><p>Since its first edition in 1990, this has become the standard reference book on assessment in Recreational Therapy. <br><br>As with the earlier editions, the purpose of this book is to provide both the therapist and the student with specific, critical information about the assessment process, specific tools, and specific standards related to assessment. The information on national assessments, such as the RAI/MDS for long-term care, is especially important to therapists. The fourth edition has 726 pages with five new assessments and updated information on all national and international standards. This book is used in over fifty colleges and nine different countries!</p><p></p><h2>More Than Allegory: On Religious Myth, Truth And Belief</h2><p>This book is a three-part journey into the rabbit hole we call the nature of reality. Its ultimate destination is a plausible, living validation of transcendence. Each of its three parts is like a turn of a spiral, exploring recurring ideas through the prisms of religious myth, truth and belief, respectively. With each turn, the book seeks to convey a more nuanced and complete understanding of the many facets of transcendence. Part I puts forward the controversial notion that many religious myths are actually true; and not just allegorically so. Part II argues that our own inner storytelling plays a surprising role in creating the seeming concreteness of things and the tangibility of history. Part III suggests, in the form of a myth, how deeply ingrained belief systems create the world we live in. The three themes, myth, truth and belief, flow into and interpenetrate each other throughout the book.</p><p>Bernardo Kastrup has a Ph.D. in philosophy and another in computer engineering.

For each week of the year, Rabbi Yael Levy searches out teachings from the Torah for guidance on how to love in the face of loss, to be open to joy, gratitude and beauty and to live with disappointments, sadness and pain. Using Rabbi Levy&#x2019;s own translations from the Hebrew, &#x201c;Directing the Heart&#x201d; can serve as a sourcebook for spiritual exploration for people of all faiths and paths. The book highlights the usefulness of taking time each day to set intentions and engage in spiritual practice. Each chapter includes a poetic meditation on the week&#x2019;s text followed by a recommendation for how to bring the teaching into daily life. Interest in Mindfulness has moved into mainstream American culture and Jewish Mindfulness adds an innovative spiritual component; Rabbi Levy has been exploring its potential for nearly two decades. Her approach strives to awaken the attention &#x2013; to direct the heart &#x2013; and strengthen the ability to meet well all that we encounter.</p><p>Rabbi Yael Levy&#39;s approach to Mindfulness is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition and is accessible to people of different faiths and paths. Her commitment to spiritual practice grows out of a passionate belief in its potential to change individuals and the world. As rabbinic director of A Way In Jewish Mindfulness organization (http: //awayin.org), Rabbi Levy shares original teachings, translations and guided meditations with diverse audiences around the world. She leads contemplative retreats and Shabbat and holiday celebrations integrating Jewish practices and the wisdom of the earth. Named as one of &#34;America&#39;s Most Inspiring Rabbis&#34; by the Jewish Forward, Rabbi Levy has been a scholar-in-residence in various settings through the country. She is a spiritual director to rabbinical students in the Reconstructionist and Reform movements and in private practice. Rabbi Levy leads Shabbat Mindfulness services twice a month at Mishkan Shalom synagogue in Philadelphia. She is a graduate of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College and has trained with the Institute for Jewish Spirituality.<p>"This collection is a magnificent gift to anyone interested in experiencing Torah in new and profound ways. Rabbi Levy offers poetic renditions of each of the weekly portions and then translates the content into contemplative practices. This will be of enormous value to all kinds of practitioners of Torah and mindfulness, communities of learning and practice. It is a wonderful resource and a great delight that it has come to be." </p><p><em>- Rabbi Sheila Peltz Weinberg</em></p></p><h2>The Lost Horse: A Chinese Folktale</h2><p>Acclaimed author-illustrator Ed Young breathes new life into the ancient Chinese folktale of a horse that brings extraordinary reversals of fortune to its trusting owner. <br> <br>A timeless fable, <i>The Lost Horse</i> teaches of the ever-changing fortunes of life.<br></p><p>Hardcover published in 1998<br>0-15-201016-5<br>ED YOUNG is the renowned author-illustrator of more than fifty books for children, including the Caldecott Medal-winning Lon Po Po: A Red-Riding Hood Story from China and the Caldecott Honor book Seven Blind Mice.

Finally, renowned behaviorist David J. Lieberman shows you how to stop the lies and uncover the truth-- in <i>any</i> conversation or situation. In a simple, user-friendly format, Dr. Lieberman gives you the tools to determine, with uncanny accuracy, if you are being lied to.</p><p>Utilizing newly developed techniques in hypnosis and psycholinguistics, this book also shows you how to easily influence anyone to tell the truth-- <i>within minutes</i>. Use it in any situation, from casual conversation to in-depth interviews. <i>Never Be Lied to Again</i> is chock-full of colorful examples and engaging scenarios to help you keep from being taken advantage of and give you that extra edge. Use these groundbreaking techniques to take control of every personal and business situation...and never be lied to again.</p></p><p>When liars are being accused of something, they'll stay calm because they're working on their rebuttal; this is why detectives were suspicious of O.J. Simpson when he didn't express outrage when accused of murdering his ex-wife and Ronald Goldman. <i>Never Be Lied to Again</i> is bursting with tested tips like this for quickly determining when you're being boondoggled. Body language, facial expressions, sentence structure, and word choice can all reveal when someone is lying, says psychologist David J. Lieberman, and he includes 46 of these "clues to deception" to help you, including tricks for framing questions without putting others on the defense. Once you use your newly honed "human lie detector" skills to figure out if you're being lied to, you can then dig for the truth using the specific, influential words and body postures that Lieberman suggests. Written with flair and humor, <i>Never Be Lied to Again</i> is designed to help you get the upper hand in any situation, whether you're trying to figure out if your spouse is cheating on you or if you suspect your coworkers are cooking the books."A fascinating book." --<i>National Public Radio</i><p> "This book can change your life.

It combines a shrewd insight into character, a vivid realization of the picturesque, and a singular ability to bring the past to blazing life, making it a reading experience as thrilling as any novel. As John D.

This Prince, in the year 1744, while hastening from one end of his kingdom to the other, and suspending his conquests in Flanders that he might fly to the assistance of Alsace, was arrested at Metz by a malady which threatened to cut short his days. At the news of this, Paris, all in terror, seemed a city taken by storm: the churches resounded with supplications and groans; the prayers of priests and people were every moment interrupted by their sobs: and it was from an interest so dear and tender that this Surname of Bien-aim� fashioned itself,&#x2014;a title higher still than all the rest which this great Prince has earned.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> So stands it written; in lasting memorial of that year 1744. Thirty other years have come and gone; and &#x201c;this great Prince&#x201d; again lies sick; but in how altered circumstances now! Churches resound not with excessive groanings; Paris is stoically calm; sobs interrupt no prayers, for indeed none are offered; except Priests&#x2019; Litanies, read or chanted at fixed money-rate per hour, which are not liable to interruption. This shepherd of the people has been carried home from Little Trianon, heavy of heart, and been put to bed in his own Ch�teau of Versailles: the flock knows it, and heeds it not. At most, in the immeasurable tide of French Speech (which ceases not day after day, and only ebbs towards the short hours of night), may this of the royal sickness emerge from time to time as an article of news. Bets are doubtless depending; nay, some people &#x201c;express themselves loudly in the streets.&#x201d; But for the rest, on green field and steepled city, the May sun shines out, the May evening fades; and men ply their useful or useless business as if no Louis lay in danger.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dame Dubarry, indeed, might pray, if she had a talent for it; Duke d&#x2019;Aiguillon too, Maupeou and the Parlement Maupeou: these, as they sit in their high places, with France harnessed under their feet, know well on what basis they continue there. Look to it, D&#x2019;Aiguillon; sharply as thou didst, from the Mill of St. Cast, on Quiberon and the invading English; thou &#x201c;covered if not with glory yet with meal!&#x201d; Fortune was ever accounted inconstant: and each dog has but his day.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Forlorn enough languished Duke d&#x2019;Aiguillon, some years ago; covered, as we said, with meal; nay with worse. For La Chalotais, the Breton Parlementeer, accused him not only of poltroonery and tyranny, but even concussion (official plunder of money); which accusations it was easier to get &#x201c;quashed&#x201d; by backstairs Influences than to get answered: neither could the thoughts, or even the tongues of men be tied. Thus, under disastrous eclipse, had this grand-nephew of the great Richelieu to glide about; unworshipped by the world; resolute Choiseul, the abrupt proud man, disdaining him, or even forgetting him. Little prospect but to glide into Gascony, to rebuild Ch�teaus there, and die inglorious killing game! However, in the year 1770, a certain young soldier, Dumouriez by name, returning from Corsica, could see &#x201c;with sorrow, at Compi�gne, the old King of France, on foot, with doffed hat, in sight of his army, at the side of a magnificent phaeton, doing homage to the&#x2014;Dubarry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Much lay therein! Thereby, for one thing, could D&#x2019;Aiguillon postpone the rebuilding of his Ch�teau, and rebuild his fortunes first. For stout Choiseul would discern in the Dubarry nothing but a wonderfully dizened Scarlet-woman; and go on his way as if she were not. Intolerable: the source of sighs, tears, of pettings and poutings; which would not end till &#x201c;France&#x201d; (La France, as she named her royal valet) finally mustered heart to see Choiseul; and with that &#x201c;quivering in the chin&#x201d; (tremblement du menton) natural in such case, faltered out a dismissal: dismissal of his last substantial man, but pacification of his Scarlet-woman. Thus D&#x2019;Aiguillon rose again, and culminated. And with him there rose Maupeou, the banisher of Parlements; who plants you a refractory President &#x201c;at Croe in Combrailles on the top of steep rocks, inaccessible except by litters,&#x201d; there to consider himself. Likewise there rose Abb� Terray, dissolute Financier, paying eightpence in the shilling,&#x2014;so that wits exclaim in some press at the playhouse, &#x201c;Where is Abb� Terray, that he might reduce us to two-thirds!&#x201d; And so have these individuals (verily by black-art) built them a Domdaniel, or enchanted Dubarrydom; call it an Armida-Palace, where they dwell pleasantly; Chancellor Maupeou &#x201c;playing blindman&#x2019;s-buff &#x201d; with the scarlet Enchantress; or gallantly presenting her with dwarf Negroes;&#x2014;and a Most Christian King has unspeakable peace within doors, whatever he may have without. &#x201c;My Chancellor is a scoundrel; but I cannot do without him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Beautiful Armida-Palace, where the inmates live enchanted lives; lapped in soft music of adulation; waited on by the splendours of the world;&#x2014;which nevertheless hangs wondrously as by a single hair. Should the Most Christian King die; or even get seriously afraid of dying! For, alas, had not the fair haughty Chateauroux to fly, with wet cheeks and flaming heart, from that Fever-scene at Metz, long since; driven forth by sour shavelings? She hardly returned, when fever and shavelings were both swept into the background. Pompadour too, when Damiens wounded Royalty &#x201c;slightly, under the fifth rib,&#x201d; and our drive to Trianon went off futile, in shrieks and madly shaken torches,&#x2014;had to pack, and be in readiness: yet did not go, the wound not proving poisoned. For his &#x201c;Majesty has religious faith; believes, at least in a Devil. And now a third peril; and who knows what may be in it! For the Doctors look grave; ask privily, If his Majesty had not the small-pox long ago?&#x2014;and doubt it may have been a false kind. Yes, Maupeou, pucker those sinister brows of thine, and peer out on it with thy malign rat-eyes: it is a questionable case. Sure only that man is mortal; that with the life of one mortal snaps irrevocably the wonderfullest talisman, and all Dubarrydom rushes off, with tumult, into infinite Space; and ye, as subterranean Apparitions are wont, vanish utterly,&#x2014;leaving only a smell of sulphur!<br> &nbsp;<br> These, and what holds of these may pray,&#x2014;to Beelzebub, or whoever will hear them. But from the rest of France there comes, as was said, no prayer; or one of an opposite character, &#x201c;expressed openly in the streets.&#x201d; Ch�teau or H�tel, where an enlightened Philosophism scrutinizes many things, is not given to prayer: neither are Rossbach victories, Terray Finances, nor, say only &#x201c;sixty thousand Lettres de Cachet&#x201d; (which is Maupeou&#x2019;s share), persuasives towards that. O H�nault! Prayers? From a France smitten (by black-art) with plague after plague; and lying now, in shame and pain, with a Harlot&#x2019;s foot on its neck, what prayer can come? Those lank scarecrows, that prowl hunger-stricken through all highways and byways of French Existence, will they pray? The dull millions that, in the workshop or furrowfield, grind foredone at the wheel of Labour, like haltered gin-horses, if blind so much the quieter? Or they that in the Bic�tre Hospital, &#x201c;eight to a bed,&#x201d; lie waiting their manumission? Dim are those heads of theirs, dull stagnant those hearts: to them the great Sovereign is known mainly as the great Regrater of Bread. If they hear of his sickness, they will answer with a dull Tant pis pour lui; or with the question, Will he die?<br> &nbsp;<br> Yes, will he die? that is now, for all France, the grand question, and hope; whereby alone the King&#x2019;s sickness has still some interest.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Politically Incorrect Guide to Socialism (The Politically Incorrect Guides)</h2><p>Stalin&#x2019;s gulag, impoverished North Korea, collapsing Cuba...it&#x2019;s hard to name a dogma that has failed as spectacularly as socialism. And yet leaders around the world continue to subject millions of people to this dysfunctional, violence-prone ideology.<br> <br>In <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to Socialism</i>, Kevin Williamson reveals the fatal flaw of socialism that efficient, complex economies simply can&#x2019;t be centrally planned. But even in America, that hasn&#x2019;t stopped politicians and bureaucrats from planning, to various extents, the most vital sectors of our economy: public education, energy, and the most arrogant central planning effort of them all, Obama&#x2019;s healthcare plan.<br> <br>In this provocative book, Williamson unfolds the grim history of socialism, showing how the ideology has spawned crushing poverty, devastating famines, and horrific wars. Lumbering from one crisis to the next, leaving a trail of economic devastation and environmental catastrophe, socialism has wreaked more havoc, caused more deaths, and impoverished more people than any other ideology in history especially when you include the victims of fascism, which Williamson notes is simply a variant of socialism. <br> <br>Williamson further demonstrates:<br> <br>Why, contrary to popular belief, socialism in theory is no better than socialism in practice<br>Why socialism can&#x2019;t exist without capitalism<br>How the energy powerhouse of Venezuela, under socialism, has become an economic basket case subject to rationing and blackouts<br>How socialism, not British colonialism, plunged the bountiful economy of India into stagnation and dysfunction and how capitalism is rescuing it<br>Why socialism is inextricably linked to communism<br> <br>If you thought socialism went into the dustbin of history with the collapse of the Soviet Union, think again. Socialism is alive and kicking, and it&#x2019;s already spread further than you know.</p><p><br><i>Praise for</i><br><b>The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to Socialism</b><br><br> This really should be required reading for those who think that socialism is a relic of a half forgotten past. Contrary to popular belief, the socialist impulse is alive and well. It&#x2019;s been said that socialism would only work in Heaven&#x2014;where it&#x2019;s not needed&#x2014;and in Hell&#x2014;where they&#x2019;ve already got it. With the cool detachment of an exorcist, Kevin Williamson methodically demolishes the allegedly angelic good intentions behind socialism to reveal the demonic consequences of its implementation.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Jonah Goldberg</b>, editor at large of National Review Online and author of <i>Liberal Fascism</i><br><br> Socialism isn&#x2019;t dead&#x2014;it&#x2019;s just in disguise. From Lenin and Hugo Chavez to state&#x2013;run industries and U. S. healthcare, Kevin Williamson puts his finger on what makes government planners&#x2019; dreams of running our lives not only ineffective, but dangerous: they don&#x2019;t know half as much as they think they do. Exploring the socialists&#x2019; philosophy in their own words, Williamson shows why the problem with socialism isn&#x2019;t just that it hurts the economy, but that it undermines all the institutions that allow a free society to function&#x2014;and that is why it can&#x2019;t co&#x2013;exist with liberty.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Mark Levin</b>, nationally syndicated talk radio host and author of <i>Liberty and Tyranny</i><br><br> In <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to Socialism</i>, Kevin Williamson cuts through the confusion about socialism, providing long overdue clarity and precision. In the process he exposes the insidious nature of the ideology, including its various American forms, and he drives a stake through the heart of today&#x2019;s apologetics for this menace. The book is scholarly, informative, and absolutely fascinating.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;David Limbaugh</b>, author of <i>Crimes Against Liberty</i><br><br> Kevin Williamson takes a look at socialism in all its forms, and he uncovers some facts that might make even would&#x2013;be socialists wince: socialism isn&#x2019;t just bad for business, but bad for the poor, bad for the environment, and bad for your health. If you want to understand the deeper ideological forces at work in our politics today, <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide&#x2122; to Socialism</i> is a good place to start.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Larry Kudlow</b>, host of CNBC&#x2019;s the <i>Kudlow Report</i><br><b>Kevin D.

Is it Walking John, the two-hundred-year-old ghost who haunts Blood Moon Bay? And who beside the ghost is roaming the local woods at night? If Toby uncovered something sinister, was his death no accident? <br><br>The arrival of handsome Scotland Yard inspector Drew Merriken, a former RAF pilot with mysteries of his own, leaves Jillian with more questions than answers&#x2014;and with the added complication of a powerful, mutual attraction. Even as she suspects someone will do anything to hide the truth, she begins to discover spine-chilling secrets that lie deep within Rothewell...and at the very heart of who she is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><b>Simone St. James</b> is the award-winning author of&nbsp; <i>An Inquiry into Love and Death</i> and <i>The Haunting of Maddy Clare</i>, which won two RITA awards from Romance Writers of America and an Arthur Ellis Award from Crime Writers of Canada.&nbsp; She wrote her first ghost story, about a haunted library, when she was in high school, and spent twenty years behind the scenes in the television business before leaving to write full-time.

Katz</b> Coauthor of <i>Young Investigators: The Project Approach in the Early Years</i> &nbsp; By the time they reach preschool or kindergarten, young children are already writers. They don't have much experience, but they're filled with stories to tell and ideas to express - they want to show the world what they know and see. All they need is a nurturing teacher like you to recognize the writer at work within them. All you need to help them is <i>Already Ready</i>. &nbsp; Taking an exciting, new approach to working with our youngest students, <i>Already Ready </i>shows you how, by respecting children as writers, engaged in bookmaking, you can gently &nbsp;nudge them toward a lifetime of joyful writing. Katie Wood Ray and Matt Glover guide you through fundamental concepts of early writing. Providing numerous, helpful examples of early writing - complete with transcriptions - they demonstrate how to: <ul> <li><b>make sense of children's writing </b>and interpret how they represent sounds, ideas, and images</li> <li><b>see important developmental signs</b> in writers that you can use to help them grow further</li> <li><b>recognize the thinking</b> <b>young children engage in</b> and discover that it's the <i>same</i> &nbsp;thinking more experienced writers use to craft purposeful, thoughtful pieces.</li> </ul> &nbsp; Then Ray and Glover show you how little ones can develop powerful understandings about: <ul> <li>texts and their characteristics </li> <li>the writing process</li> <li>what it means to be a <i>writer</i>.</li> </ul> You'll learn how to support your writers' quest to make meaning, as they grow their abilities and refine their thinking about writing through teaching strategies such as: <ul> <li>reading aloud</li> <li>working side by side with writers</li> <li>sharing children's writing.</li> </ul> &nbsp; Writing is just one part of a busy early childhood classroom, but even in little doses, a nurturing approach can work wonders and help children connect the natural writer inside them to a life of expressing themselves on paper. Find that approach, share it with your students, and you'll discover that you don't have to get students ready to write - they're <i>Already Ready</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><p>For many years as the author of bestselling Heinemann books such as About the Authors, Study Driven, Already Ready, and In Pictures and In Words, and as a member of Heinemann's Professional Development Services, Katie Wood Ray gave teachers resources and PD that transformed writing instruction and helped children discover a lifelong love of writing.

This is the only&nbsp;pressure cooker book you'll ever need.</p><p><b>BRUCE WEINSTEIN and MARK SCARBROUGH</b> are the creators of <i>The</i> <i>Great American Slow Cooker Book </i>as well as the bestselling <i>Ultimate Cookbook </i>series (on subjects as diverse as pizza, ham, candy, shrimp, and peanut butter), <i>Goat: Meat, Milk, Cheese,</i> and <i>Grain Mains.</i> They were nominated for a James Beard Award in 2011 and are regular contributors to WeightWatchers.com and <i>Eating Well, Cooking Light,</i> and <i>the Washington Post.</i>chapter 1<br><br>Breakfast<br><br>Who digs a pressure cooker out of the cabinet on a busy Tuesday morning? Not �us&#x2014;�but we do get it out for a Saturday �mid- morning breakfast or any time we have weekend guests in from New York City. Or on the holidays when we&#x2019;ve got a house full of family. Or during busy photo shoots when we want a hot breakfast. Come to think of it: we&#x2019;ve probably pulled out the pressure cooker on a Tuesday morning.<br><br>Using a pressure cooker for breakfast isn&#x2019;t just about faster cooking; it&#x2019;s also about better cooking. Toast is fast. A pressure cooker layers depths of flavor in breakfast casseroles and compotes, hashes, and even porridges, all without much effort.<br><br>Take �steel-�cut oats. Yes, they&#x2019;re done in minutes under pressure, as opposed to a long simmer in a saucepan. But they&#x2019;re also done better: they not only take on the vaunted creaminess that �long-�cooking affords but also pick up more flavor from the surrounding liquid and dried fruit. <br><br>Retaining a bit of firmness underneath the velvety luxury, they end up with better texture and a more intense flavor. They&#x2019;re definitely more satisfying than any microwave fare.<br><br>You may also be surprised at how pressure cooks eggs: the whites stay creamy and delicate; the yolks, set to your preference. At this point, we can&#x2019;t imagine making �soft-�boiled eggs any other way.<br><br>Of course, there&#x2019;s a &#x201c;but&#x201d; or two: pay attention to the stated release in these recipes and follow the instructions carefully. Some grains get foamy under pressure and will spurt out of the pressure valve if you attempt a quick release when a natural one is called for. Others need a bit of time under a natural release so they can absorb moisture and get tender without going gummy.<br><br>Most whole grains need to be presoaked. And be prepared to eat when breakfast is ready. Many of these dishes �aren&#x2019;t forgiving: bread puddings can get dry; eggs can turn tough. So make the coffee, set the table, and prepare the breakfast recipe as the last task in the list. Listen, �that&#x2019;s not a bad thing. If ever a meal called for efficiency, it&#x2019;s breakfast. The day awaits!<br><br>One more thing: we&#x2019;ve adjusted the Effort label in this first chapter. That is, recipes that might have been marked &#x201c;a little&#x201d; in a subsequent chapter are labeled &#x201c;a lot&#x201d; of effort here. Given that we stumble around half blind before our second cup of coffee, we sometimes think melting butter in the morning qualifies as heroic.<br><br>So here are some fine hot cereals, breakfast bread puddings, potato hashes, and fruit compotes. We&#x2019;ve even got a fine and fast sausage gravy, a sweet breakfast version of polenta, and an innovative �top-�of-�the-�morning risotto for a special treat. You provide the toast and coffee; the pressure cooker will do the rest.<br><br>Apple Maple Oatmeal<br><br>Effort: Not much � Pressure: High � Time under pressure: 12 or 18 minutes � Release: Natural � Serves: 4<br><br>1/2 cup �steel-�cut oats<br><br>1/2 cup chopped dried apples<br><br>1/4 cup maple syrup<br><br>1/4 cup sliced almonds<br><br>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br><br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br><br>1Mix everything with 21/4 cups water in a �6-�quart stovetop or electric pressure cooker.<br><br>2Lock the lid onto the pot.<br><br>STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi).

Cook for <br><br>12 minutes.<br><br>OR<br><br>ELECTRIC: Set the machine to cook at high pressure (9&#x2013;11 psi). Set the machine&#x2019;s timer to cook at this pressure for 18 minutes.<br><br>3Reduce the pressure.<br><br>STOVETOP: Set the pot off the heat and let its pressure return to normal, about 10 minutes.<br><br>OR<br><br>ELECTRIC: Turn off the machine or unplug it so it �doesn&#x2019;t jump to its �keep-�warm setting. Allow the pot&#x2019;s pressure to return to normal, 10 to 12 minutes.<br><br>If the pressure in the pot �hasn&#x2019;t come back to normal within 12 minutes, use the �quick-�release method to bring it back to normal.<br><br>4Unlock and open the pot; stir well before serving.<br><br>Testers&#x2019; Notes<br><br>This is a �whole-�grain breakfast in minutes! It&#x2019;s one of the perks of owning a pressure cooker.<br><br>Use only �steel-�cut oats (also called &#x201c;pinhead oats&#x201d; or &#x201c;Irish oats&#x201d;), not rolled oats and not the more ground Scottish oats, and certainly not instant oats. �Steel-�cut oats are the whole groats (bran, germ, and endosperm), cut into smaller pieces.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t even think about using anything but real maple syrup in this recipe.<br><br>You can substitute chopped dried pears, nectarines, peaches, or apricots for the apples.<br><br>Serve It Up! Warm some milk, �half-�and-�half, or cream in a small saucepan over low heat or in the microwave for a couple of minutes on high (but do not boil). Pour over each serving.<br><br>Creamy Banana Oatmeal<br><br>Effort: Not much � Pressure: High � Time under pressure: 12 or 18 minutes � Release: Natural � Serves: 4<br><br>1/2 cup �steel-�cut oats<br><br>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar<br><br>2 ripe bananas, chopped<br><br>2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br><br>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br><br>1/4 teaspoon salt<br><br>1/4 cup heavy cream<br><br>1Mix the oats, brown sugar, bananas, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt with 21/4 cups water in a �6-�quart stovetop or electric pressure cooker until the brown sugar dissolves.<br><br>2Lock the lid onto the pot.<br><br>STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi).

Set the machine&#x2019;s timer to cook at high pressure for 18 minutes.<br><br>3Reduce the pressure.<br><br>STOVETOP: Set the pot off the heat and let its pressure fall to normal naturally, about 10 minutes.<br><br>OR<br><br>ELECTRIC: Turn off the machine or unplug it so it �doesn&#x2019;t flip to its �keep-�warm setting. Allow the pot&#x2019;s pressure to come to normal naturally, 10 to 12 minutes.<br><br>If the pot&#x2019;s pressure �hasn&#x2019;t returned to normal within 12 minutes, use the �quick-�release method to bring it back to normal.<br><br>4Unlock and open the cooker. Stir in the cream and set aside for 1 minute to warm before serving.<br><br>Testers&#x2019; Notes<br><br>Don&#x2019;t double the amount of oats in any of these porridges: the grains are stocked with a sticky starch that will rise up and clog the pressure release valve. If you&#x2019;ve got more than four persons for breakfast, make two batches.<br><br>For the best flavor, the bananas should be quite ripe, their skins mottled with plenty of brown spots. Look for the ones just about to be discounted: these are the best candidates.<br><br>You can substitute light cream, �half-�and-�half, regular evaporated milk, or almond milk for the heavy cream.<br><br>Bulgur, Oat, and Walnut Porridge<br><br>Effort: A little � Pressure: High � Time under pressure: 16 or 24 minutes � Release: Quick � Serves: 6 to 8<br><br>1/2 cup �steel-�cut oats<br><br>1/2 cup bulgur<br><br>1/2 cup chopped walnuts<br><br>1/2 cup maple syrup<br><br>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br><br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br><br>1Mix everything with 4 cups water in a �6-�quart stovetop or electric pressure cooker.<br><br>2Lock the lid onto the pot.<br><br>STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi). Once this pressure has been reached, reduce the heat as much as possible while keeping the pressure constant. Cook for <br><br>16 minutes.<br><br>OR<br><br>ELECTRIC: Set the machine to cook at high pressure (9&#x2013;11 psi). Set the machine&#x2019;s timer to cook at high pressure for 24 minutes.<br><br>3Use the �quick-�release method to bring the pot&#x2019;s pressure back to normal.<br><br>4Unlock and remove the lid. Set the stovetop cooker over medium heat or turn the electric cooker to its browning function. Bring to a simmer, stirring often. Cook, stirring constantly, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes.<br><br>Testers&#x2019; Notes<br><br>Because of the way bulgur absorbs water, there may be a little liquid left in the cereal after �cooking&#x2014;�a good thing, since it can scorch otherwise. So we advise simmering the cereal after cooking under pressure. That said, if you open the pot and find the porridge has a consistency to your liking, there&#x2019;s no need for that extra work in step 4.<br><br>Bulgur is sold by �grinds&#x2014;�fine, �medium-�coarse, and �extra-�coarse. However, those grinds are often not labeled on the packaging except in certain brands sold at �health-�food or gourmet stores. Any grind will work here, although fine (sometimes labeled &#x201c;instant&#x201d;) is probably the least successful, more like Cream of Wheat.<br><br>Maple syrup is sold by grades, with some packagers using letters and others using numbers: A or 1 is the lighter in flavor. Grade A or 1 is further broken down into light amber, medium amber, and dark amber. While many people like Grade A or 1 for pancakes, we prefer Grade B or 2 because of its more assertive flavor, including darkly herbaceous notes to pair against the other intense flavors.<br><br>Substitute chopped pecans or pistachios for the walnuts.<br><br>Serve It Up! Put a pat of butter and some freshly grated nutmeg on each serving.<br><br>Cheesy Grits<br><br>Effort: A lot � Pressure: High � Time under pressure: 12 or 18 minutes � Release: Modified natural � Serves: 4 to 6<br><br>1 cup corn grits (not instant)<br><br>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into very small bits<br><br>1/2 teaspoon salt<br><br>1 cup finely grated Cheddar cheese, preferably white (about 4 ounces)<br><br>Bottled hot red pepper sauce, such as Tabasco, to taste<br><br>1Set the pressure cooker rack inside a stovetop or electric cooker; pour in 2 cups water. Make an aluminum foil sling (see page 19) and set a �2-�quart, �high-�sided, round baking or souffl� dish on it. Mix the grits, butter, and salt with 21/2 cups water in the baking dish until smooth.<br><br>2Use the foil sling to lower the uncovered dish onto the rack in the cooker. (Do not cover the baking dish.) Fold the ends of the sling so they&#x2019;ll fit inside the cooker.<br><br>3Lock the lid onto the pot.<br><br>STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi). Once this pressure has been reached, reduce the heat as much as possible while keeping this pressure constant. Cook for <br><br>12 minutes.<br><br>OR<br><br>ELECTRIC: Set the machine to cook at high pressure (9&#x2013;11 psi). Set the machine&#x2019;s timer to cook at this pressure for 18 minutes.<br><br>4Turn off the heat and or unplug the machine. Set aside for 5 minutes, then use the �quick-�release method to drop the pot&#x2019;s pressure back to normal.<br><br>5Unlock and remove the lid. Lift the baking dish out of the cooker with its sling, steadying it as necessary to get it to a cutting board. Stir in the cheese and hot red pepper sauce; set aside for 1 minute to melt the cheese before serving.<br><br>Testers&#x2019; Notes<br><br>If you&#x2019;ve never had cheese grits from a pressure cooker, you&#x2019;re missing the creamiest cheese grits available. The intense cooking environment forces just the right amount of moisture into the bits of corn, and even without stirring, it&#x2019;s perfect every time.<br><br>There&#x2019;s no reason to use a �run-�of-�the-�mill hot red pepper sauce here. Check out versions with smoky chipotles or even fiery habanero chiles.<br><br>Serve It Up! Spoon the grits onto a plate and top each serving with a fried egg; serve bacon on the side.<br><br>Apple, Ham, and Grits Casserole<br><br>Effort: A lot � Pressure: High � Time under pressure: 15 or 22 minutes � Release: Quick � Serves: 4 to 6<br><br>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more for buttering the dish<br><br>8 ounces Canadian bacon, chopped<br><br>1 medium tart green apple, such as Granny Smith, peeled, cored, and chopped<br><br>4 medium scallions, green and white parts, trimmed and sliced into thin bits<br><br>1 teaspoon dried thyme<br><br>3/4 cup �quick-�cooking or instant grits<br><br>2 large eggs, lightly beaten<br><br>1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese (about 2 ounces)<br><br>1Melt the butter in a �6-�quart stovetop pressure cooker set over medium heat or in a �6-�quart electric pressure cooker turned to the browning function.

Wipe out the cooker with a damp paper towel.<br><br>2Set the stovetop model back over medium heat or turn the electric one back to its browning or simmer mode. Add 3 cups water and bring to a boil. Whisk in the grits and cook, whisking all the while, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Scrape the grits into the bowl with the bacon mixture; cool for 10 minutes. Wash and dry the cooker.<br><br>3Set the pressure cooker rack inside the cooker and pour in 2 cups water. Make a foil sling (see page 19) and set a �2-�quart, �high-�sided, round baking or souffl� dish on top of it. Lightly butter the inside of the dish.<br><br>4Stir the eggs and cheese into the grits mixture until uniform and well combined. Spread the mixture in the prepared baking dish; cover and seal with foil. Lower the dish onto the rack in the cooker with the sling. Fold the ends of the sling so they&#x2019;ll fit inside the cooker.<br><br>5Lock the lid onto the pot.<br><br>STOVETOP: Set the pot over high heat and bring it to high pressure (15 psi).

Use the sling to transfer the baking dish to a wire cooling rack, steadying the dish as necessary. Uncover, cool a couple of minutes, and spoon the casserole onto individual plates to serve.<br><br>Testers&#x2019; Notes<br><br>Here&#x2019;s the perfect brunch dish: a creamy, cheesy casserole with big flavors. You just need the mimosas.<br><br>Be careful: the cooker will be hot as you wipe it out between steps of this recipe.<br><br>You can make the recipe through step 3 up to 1 hour in advance.<br><br>Try substituting one ripe Bosc pear for the apple.

He describes what it was like to interview the mighty Robert Moses and to begin discovering the extent of the political power Moses wielded; the combination of discouragement and exhilaration he felt confronting the vast holdings of the Lyndon B. Johnson Library in Austin, Texas; his encounters with witnesses, including longtime residents wrenchingly displaced by the construction of Moses' Cross-Bronx Expressway and Lady Bird Johnson acknowledging the beauty and influence of one of LBJ's mistresses. He gratefully remembers how, after years of working in solitude, he found a writers' community at the New York Public Library, and details the ways he goes about planning and composing his books. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caro recalls the moments at which he came to understand that he wanted to write not just about the men who wielded power but about the people and the politics that were shaped by that power. And he talks about the importance to him of the writing itself, of how he tries to infuse it with a sense of place and mood to bring characters and situations to life on the page. Taken together, these reminiscences--some previously published, some written expressly for this book--bring into focus the passion, the wry self-deprecation, and the integrity with which this brilliant historian has always approached his work.</p><p>For his biographies of Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson, ROBERT A. CARO has twice won the Pulitzer Prize, twice won the National Book Award, three times won the National Book Critics Circle Award, and has also won virtually every other major literary honor, including the Gold Medal in Biography from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the Francis Parkman Prize. In 2010, President Barack Obama awarded Caro the National Humanities Medal. Caro graduated from Princeton, was later a Nieman Fellow at Harvard, and worked for six years as an investigative reporter for Newsday. He lives with his wife, the writer Ina Caro, in New York City, where he is at work on the fifth and final volume of The Years of Lyndon Johnson.Chapter 1<br><br>&#x201c;Turn Every Page&#x201d;<br><br>People are always asking me why I chose Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson to write about. Well, I must say I never thought of my books as the stories of Moses or Johnson. I never had the slightest interest in writing the life of a great man. From the very start I thought of writing biographies as a means of illuminating the times of the men I was writing about and the great forces that molded those times&#x2014;particularly the force that is political power.<br><br>Why political power? Because political power shapes all of our lives. It shapes your life in little ways that you might not even think about. For example, when you&#x2019;re driv�ing up to the Triborough (now Robert F. Kennedy) Bridge in Manhattan in New York, you may notice that the bridge comes down across the East River in Queens opposite 100th Street. So why do you have to drive all the way up from 100th Street to 125th Street to cross it, and then basically drive back, which adds almost three totally unnecessary miles to every journey across the bridge.<br><br>Well, the reason is political power. In 1934, Robert Moses was trying to get the Triborough Bridge built, and he couldn&#x2019;t because there wasn&#x2019;t enough public or political support for the project. William Randolph Hearst, the publisher of three influential newspapers in New York, owned a block of tenements on 125th Street. Before the Depression, the tenements had been profitable, but now poor people didn&#x2019;t have jobs, and couldn&#x2019;t pay their rent. Hearst was losing money on the buildings and he wanted the city to take them off his hands by condemning them for some project. Robert Moses saw that the project could be the Triborough Bridge, and that&#x2019;s why the bridge entrance is at 125th Street. That&#x2019;s a small way in which political power affects your life. But there are larger ways, too.<br><br>Every time a young man or woman goes to college on a federal education bill passed by Lyndon Johnson, that&#x2019;s political power. Every time an elderly man or woman, or an impoverished man or woman of any age, gets a doctor&#x2019;s bill or a hospital bill and sees that it&#x2019;s been paid by Medicare or Medicaid, that&#x2019;s political power. Every time a black man or woman is able to walk into a voting booth in the South because of Lyndon Johnson&#x2019;s Voting Rights Act, that&#x2019;s political power. And so, unfortunately, is a young man&#x2014;58,000 young American men&#x2014;dying a needless death in Vietnam. <i>That&#x2019;s</i> political power. It affects your life in all sorts of ways. My books are an attempt to analyze and explain that power.<br>When did I start writing? It seems to me that I always wrote. I went to elementary school at Public School 93 in Manhattan. It was on 93rd Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It had never had a school newspaper, so when I was in the sixth grade I created one. We mimeographed it. I remember I couldn&#x2019;t get the ink off my hands&#x2014;I showed up in class with ink all over them.<br><br>My mother died when I was eleven, and before she died she told my father that she wanted him to send me to the Horace Mann School. I began there in the seventh grade, and almost immediately I began working on the school newspaper. The paper meant something special. I don&#x2019;t think we were even conscious of what, but we knew. To this day, I have dinner fairly regularly with guys who worked with me on the <i>Horace Mann Record</i>.<br><br>I always liked finding out how things work and trying to explain them to people. It was a vague, inchoate feeling&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t think of it in terms of, Why do I want to be a reporter? At Princeton, I was the paper&#x2019;s sportswriter and I had a column, but I found myself writing more about the coach and about how he coached than about how the team was actually doing. I think figuring things out and trying to explain them was always a part of it.<br><br>My first job out of Princeton, in 1957, was for a newspaper in New Jersey&#x2014;the New Brunswick <i>Daily Home News</i>, &#x201c;The Voice of the Raritan Valley&#x201d;&#x2014;that was very closely tied to the Democratic political machine in New Brunswick. In fact, it was so closely tied to the machine that its chief <i>political</i> reporter, who was so elderly that he had actually covered the Lindbergh kidnapping in the early Thirties, would be given a leave of absence during the political campaign&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the chief political reporter&#x2014;so that he could write speeches for the Democratic organization. This reporter suffered a minor heart attack shortly after I got there, so someone else was going to have to write the speeches, and he wanted it to be someone who would pose no threat to his getting the job back later, so he picked this kid from Princeton, and I found myself working for the political boss of New Brunswick, this tough old guy.<br><br>For some reason, he took a shine to me. My salary at the paper was fifty-two dollars a week. No specific salary was mentioned when I went to work for him, but every time he liked a speech I wrote he would pull out a wad of fifty-dollar bills and hundred-dollar bills and peel off what seemed like quite a few and give them to me. I was happy with that aspect of the job, but then came Election Day.<br><br>He brought me along to ride the polls with him, which meant going from polling place to polling place to make sure that everything was proceeding as it should. But on this particular day the driver of his limousine wasn&#x2019;t the regular driver. The driver had been replaced by a police captain.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t understand why, but as we got to each polling place a policeman would come over to the car, and the captain and my employer would roll down their windows, and the boss would ask how things were going. Usually the answer was everything is &#x201c;under control.&#x201d; But at one polling place, the policeman said they had had some trouble, but they were taking care of it. And then I saw that there was a group of African-American demonstrators, neatly dressed men and women, mostly young, who had obviously been protesting something that was going on at the polls. And as I watched, police paddy wagons pulled up. There was one there already. And the police were herding the protesters into the paddy wagons, nudging them along with their nightsticks.<br><br>The thing that got me when I thought about this in later years&#x2014;what it was that really hit me&#x2014;was the meekness of these people; their acceptance, as if this was the sort of thing they expected, that happened to them all the time. All of a sudden I didn&#x2019;t want to be in that big car with the boss. I just wanted to get out.<br><br>As I remember it, I didn&#x2019;t say a word. The next time we pulled up to a traffic light, I just opened the door and got out. The boss didn&#x2019;t say a word to me. I think he must have understood. Anyway, I never heard from him again.<br><br>But I had realized that I&#x2014;Bob Caro&#x2014;wanted to be out there with the protesters.<br><br>Not long after that, I decided that if I wanted to keep on being a reporter, I needed&#x2014;for myself&#x2014;to work for a paper that fought for things. Why? I couldn&#x2019;t explain it then, and I can&#x2019;t explain it now. But it had to do with that Election Day. With the protesters. With the cops nudging them along with the nightsticks. I had gotten so angry!<br><br>So I looked around for a newspaper that fought for causes. There were several at the time, and I wrote letters to all of them asking for a job. It took a while, but I got an offer from Newsday on Long Island&#x2014;a real crusading paper then&#x2014;and in 1959 I went to work for them.<br><br><i>Newsday</i> had a managing editor named Alan Hathway, who was an old-time newspaperman from the 1920s. He was a character right out of <i>The Front Page</i>, a broad-shouldered man with a big stomach that looked soft but wasn&#x2019;t. His head was shiny bald except for a monk-like tonsure, and rather red&#x2014;<i>very</i> red after he had started drinking for the day, which was at lunch. He wore brown shirts with white ties, and black shirts with yellow ties. We were never sure if he had actually graduated from, or even attended, college, but he had a deep prejudice against graduates of prestigious universities, and during his years at <i>Newsday</i> had never hired one, let alone one from Princeton. They hired me as a joke on him while he was on vacation. He was so angry that I was there that during my first weeks on the job, he would refuse to acknowledge my presence in his city room. I kept saying, &#x201c;Hello, Mr. Hathway,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Hi, Mr. Hathway&#x201d; when he passed my desk. He&#x2019;d never even nod. Ignoring me was easy for Mr. Hathway to do because as the low man on the paper&#x2019;s reportorial totem pole, I never worked on a story significant enough to require his involvement. When I had been working on the New Brunswick paper, Ina and I had been living in a garden apartment in Edison, New Jersey, with our baby son, Chase, and we hadn&#x2019;t yet moved to Long Island. I had told Ina we&#x2019;d better not move; I was probably going to get fired. I drove back and forth to work every day.<br><br><i>Newsday</i> then did not publish on Sundays, so as low man on the totem pole, I worked Saturday afternoons and nights, because if a story came in then, I could put the information in a memo and leave the actual writing of the story to the real reporters who came in Sunday, and would do the writing for the Monday paper. The last of the other reporters and editors would leave about noon on Saturday; for the rest of the day and the evening, I would be alone in the vast, cluttered <i>Newsday</i> city room, empty but not silent with the constant ringing of the telephones lined up on the city desk and the ceaseless clatter of the wire machines.<br><br>Late one Saturday afternoon, a telephone on the city desk rang, and when I picked it up, it was an official of the Federal Aviation Agency, calling from his office at what was then, because John F. Kennedy hadn&#x2019;t yet been assassinated, Idlewild Airport. <i>Newsday</i> had been doing a series of articles on Mitchel Field, a big Air Force base in the middle of Long Island&#x2019;s Nassau County, that the military was giving up. Its twelve hundred acres were the last large open space in the county, so what happened to it was important. The FAA was in the process of ruling that it should become a civilian airport. <i>Newsday</i>, however, felt that it should be used instead for public purposes, in particular for education, to allow Hofstra University to expand, and to create a campus for Nassau County Community College, the only public higher education available on Long Island, which was then being housed in temporary quarters in the County Courthouse in Mineola that were already too crowded to accommodate the students, many from the large low-income community in nearby Hempstead, who wanted a college degree. Public education for the poor, free public education: that was something worth fighting for.<br><br>I hadn&#x2019;t been working on any of the Mitchel Field stories. But on this Saturday, suddenly this guy from the FAA was on the phone, and he says something like, &#x201c;I really like what you guys are doing on Mitchel Field, and I&#x2019;m here alone in the FAA building, and if you send someone down here, I know what files you should be looking at, and he can look at them.&#x201d;<br><br>I was alone, the only person in the city room. This happened to be the day of the big <i>Newsday</i> annual summer picnic on the beach at Fire Island. Just about everyone else had gone, except me. None of them had a cell phone, of course, since there were no cell phones then. I called the editor who was my immediate superior, and then his superior, without being able to reach them. When, after many calls, I finally did reach an editor, he told me to call the paper&#x2019;s great investigative reporter, Bob Greene, and have him go down to Idlewild, but Greene wasn&#x2019;t reachable, either, and neither were the other reporters I was told to call. Finally the editor told me that I would have to go myself.<br><br>I will never forget that night. It was the first time I had ever gone through files. The official met me at the front door and led me to a room with a conference table in the middle of it, and, on the table, high stacks of file folders. And, somehow, in a strange way, sitting there going through them, I felt at home. As I went through the memos and the letters and the minutes of meetings I could see a pattern emerging of the real reason why the agency wanted the field to become a civilian airport: because executives of corporations with offices on Long Island, who seemed to be quite friendly with FAA officials, wanted to be able to fly in and out of Long Island in their private planes without having the inconvenience of driv�ing to Idlewild or LaGuardia Airports. I kept looking for a piece of paper on which someone came right out and said that, but I didn&#x2019;t find one; everything I could find on paper talked around that point. But between all the pieces of paper, I found sentences and paragraphs that, taken together, made the point clear. I found enough to demonstrate that.<br><br>There are certain moments in your life when you suddenly understand something about yourself. I loved going through those files, making them yield up their secrets to me. And here was a particular and fascinating secret: that these corporate executives were persuading a government agency to save them some driv�ing time at the expense of a poor kid getting an education and a better chance in life. Each discovery I made that helped to prove that was a thrill. I don&#x2019;t know why raw files affect me that way. In part, perhaps, because they are closer to reality, to genuineness. Not filtered, cleaned up, through press releases or, years later, in books. I worked all night, but I didn&#x2019;t notice the passing of time. When I finished and left the building on Sunday, the sun was coming up, and that was a surprise. I went back to the office and before driv�ing home, I wrote a memo on what I had found.<br><br>Early Monday morning, my day off, the phone rang, and it was �Alan&#x2019;s secretary, June Blom. Alan wanted to see me right away, she said. I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in New Jersey.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, he wants to see you just as soon as you can get here.&#x201d; I told Ina, with what I suppose was a wry smile, that we had been right not to move. I drove to Newsday that morning sure every mile of the way that I was about to be fired.<br><br> I ran into June just as I entered the city room; motioning to �Alan&#x2019;s office, she told me to go right in. Walking across the room, I saw, through the glass window, the big red head bent over something he was reading, and as I entered his office, I saw that what he was reading was my memo.<br><br> He �didn&#x2019;t look up. After a while, I said tentatively, "Mr. Hathway.&#x201d; I �couldn&#x2019;t get the &#x201c;Alan&#x201d; out. He motioned me to sit down, and went on reading. Finally he raised his head. &#x201c;I �didn&#x2019;t know someone from Princeton could do digging like this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;From now on, you do investigative work.&#x201d;<br><br> I responded with my usual <i>savoir faire</i>. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t know anything about investigative reporting.&#x201d;<br><br> Alan looked at me for what I remember as a very long time. &#x201c;Just remember,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Turn every page. Never assume anything. Turn every goddamned page.&#x201d; He turned to some other papers on his desk, and after a while I got up and left.</p><h2>The Uncanny (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Freud was fascinated by the mysteries of creativity and the imagination. The groundbreaking works that comprise <i>The Uncanny</i> present some of his most influential explorations of the mind. In these pieces Freud investigates the vivid but seemingly trivial childhood memories that often "screen" deeply uncomfortable desires; the links between literature and daydreaming; and our intensely mixed feelings about things we experience as "uncanny." Also included is Freud's celebrated study of Leonardo Da Vinci-his first exercise in psychobiography.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><b>Sigmund Freud </b>(1856-1939) was born in Moravia and lived in Vienna between the ages of four and eighty-two. In 1938 Hitler's invasion of Austria forced him to seek asylum in London, where he died the following year.&nbsp;Freud's career began with several years of brilliant work on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. He was almost thirty when, after a period of study under Charcot in Paris, his interests first turned to psychology, and another ten years of clinical work in Vienna (at first in collaboration with Breuer, an older colleague) saw the birth of his creation: psychoanalysis. This began simply as a method of treating neurotic patients by investigating their minds, but it quickly grew into an accumulation of knowledge about the workings of the mind in general, whether sick or healthy. Freud was thus able to demonstrate the normal development of the sexual instinct in childhood and, largely on the basis of an examination of dreams, arrived at his fundamental discovery of the unconscious forces that influence our everyday thoughts and actions. Freud's life was uneventful, but his ideas have shaped not only many specialist disciplines, but the whole intellectual climate of the last half-century.&#34;[Freud] ultimately did more for our understanding of art than any other writer since Aristotle.&#34; (Lionel Trilling)</p><h2>Biowarfare and Terrorism</h2><p>This book outlines how and why the United States government initiated, sustained and then dramatically expanded an illegal biological arms buildup. Most significantly, U.S. expert Francis A. Boyle reveals how the new billion- dollar U.S. Chemical and Biological Defense Program has been reorientated to accord with the Neo-Conservative pre-emptive strike agenda&#x2014;this time by biological and chemical warfare. Linking U.S. biowarfare development to the October 2001 anthrax attack on Congress&#x2014;the most significant political attack on the constitutional functioning of democracy in the United States in recent history&#x2014;Boyle sheds new light on the motives for the attack, the media black hole of silence into which it has fallen, and why the FBI may never apprehend the perpetrators of this seminal political crime of the 21st century. Biowarfare and Terrorism should raise public concern at what the vastly expanded US biowarfare research and purported civilian preparedness programs hold in store for America&#x2014;and the extent to which the Bush administration is prepared to pursue them, irrespective of their incitement to a global biowarfare arms race, and likely exposure of the American people to future accidents and reprisals.</p><p>Francis A. Boyle is a leading American professor, practitioner and advocate of international law. He was responsible for drafting the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, the American implementing legislation for the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. He served as Legal Advisor to the Palestinian Delegation to the Middle East Peace Negotiations from 1991 to 1993, served on the Board of Directors of Amnesty International (1988- 1992), and represented Bosnia-Herzegovina at the World Court. Professor Boyle teaches international law at the University of Illinois, Champaign and is author of many books. Francis A. Boyle holds a Doctor of Law Magna Cum Laude as well as a Ph. D. in Political Science, both from Harvard University.The NeoCons in the Bush Jr. administration have tried to sell this biowarfare arms race to the American people and the U.S. Congress as well as to the rest of the world by disingenuously claiming that it is all for the purpose of &#x2018;defense,&#x2019; which, as previously explained, is not a permissible exception to the Biological Weapons Convention in the first place. Their specious argument deludes no one but the gullible, the frightened, the disinformed, the greedy, and the deliberately panicked. Certainly other major biotech states understand full well the military implications of this rapidly expanding U.S. biowarfare industry and will proceed to respond accordingly by deploying their own national biowarfare equivalents. The world will soon witness a de facto biological arms race among the major biotech states of the world under the guise of &#x2018;defense&#x2019;, and despite the requirements of the BWC. The 1972 BWC itself will gradually fall into desuetude even if its skeleton is kept upon the law books&#x2019;unlike its contemporaneous 1972 AntiBallistic Missile Systems (ABM) Treaty that the Bush Jr. NeoCons made a point of repudiating outright on 13 December 2001,81 which they had also sought to accomplish going back to the Reagan administration,82 but now using the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks as a pretext for doing so. It will then become only a matter of time before some state intelligence agency uses biological weapons again for domestic terrorist purposes or for foreign warfare; or else a catastrophic accident occurs at some biowarfare facility in the United States or abroad. In regard to this latter eventuality, the recent mass distribution&#x2019;allegedly by mistake!&#x2019;of a virulent 1957 pandemic flu virus strain which killed between 1 million and 4 million people to 4,614 laboratories primarily in the United States and also to seventeen foreign countries is a harbinger of things to come.83 The massive proliferation of biowarfare technology, facilities, as well as trained scientists and technicians all over the United States courtesy of the NeoCon Bush Jr. administration will render a catastrophic biowarfare or bioterrorist incident or accident a statistical certainty. If such a catastrophic event should occur, it would mark the final end to democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and the Constitution in the United States of America even as we know and experience it today, as materially diminished under the burgeoning Bush Jr. NeoCon police state.</p><h2>The New Cross Stitcher&#39;s Bible: The Definitive Manual of Essential Cross Stitch and Counted Thread Techniques</h2><p>This is a completely new and revised edition of the best-selling &#34;Cross Stitcher&#39;s Bible&#34;, from one of the world&#39;s favourite cross stitch designers, Jane Greenoff.

It should be read by all interested in the history and culture of Black Americans.</p><p><b>Cyprian Davis</b> was a Benedictine monk of St. Meinrad Archabbey and professor of church history at St. Meinrad School of Theology. He was a founding member of the National Black Clergy Caucus and author of articles on Black Catholic history and black spirituality, and of a high school textbook on church history."The story of the black Catholic community in the United States begins with the story of the Catholic church in Africa." With this historical overview, Davis, professor at Indiana's St. Meinrad School of Theology, begins his task--"to retrieve a mislaid memory" of the black Catholic presence in the United States for the last 300 years. The issue of slavery--including the uneasy responses of America's first bishop, John Carroll, in the late 18th century, and the pro-slavery views of John Hughes, outspoken archbishop of New York during the Civil War--is positioned within the political and social fabric of those centuries. Yet, as shown in this masterfully concise history, the faith flourished among such black Catholics as Pierre Toussaint, the 19th-century New Yorker now proposed for sainthood. Studded with personal stories, this is a chronicle both sad and inspiring. Davis's groundbreaking research should pave the way for further exploration of the growing black Catholic community. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Inner Planets: Building Blocks of Personal Reality (Seminars in Psychological Astrology)</h2><p>The inner planets--Mercury, Venus, Mars--are the foundations of what psychology calls the ego, the sense of personal self. In this fourth volume in the Seminars in Psychological Astrology series, Liz Greene and Howard Sasportas discuss the value of the inner planets as they symbolize important aspects of personality. We are not trained to give value to our private needs, feelings, and qualities. Indeed, because of their intensely personal nature, they are often suppressed or overlooked as irrelevant to society. Likewise, the inner planets have tended to be given less attention by psychological astrologers--for they are the personal planets. The authors show us that in order to give the most that we can to our interactions with the rest of the world, we must first understand our own needs and have a healthy ego-- a personal authenticity. Their book teaches us the process of understanding how these three planets actually represent our individuality, and how they directly color the energy of the rest of our horoscope. Greene and Sasportas blend the processes of astrology and psychology in a unique and important way in this in-depth insight into the archetypes represented by the inner planets.</p><p></p><h2>Public Health Nursing: Population-Centered Health Care in the Community</h2><p><p>Ensure you have a solid understanding of community and public health nursing with this industry standard text! <b>Public Health Nursing: Population-Centered Health Care in the Community,</b> <b>10th Edition</b> provides up-to-date information on issues such as infectious diseases, natural and man-made disasters, and healthcare policies affecting individuals, families, and communities.

Yet this supremely useful teaching is often ignored due to the misconceptions about it that abound in popular culture, especially oversimplifications that make it seem like something not to be taken seriously. Karma is not simple, as Traleg Kyabgon shows, and it&#x2019;s to be taken very seriously indeed. He cuts through the persistent illusions we cling to about karma to show what it really is&#x2014;the mechanics of why we suffer and how we can make the suffering end. He explains how a realistic understanding of karma is indispensable to Buddhist practice, how it provides a foundation for a moral life, and how understanding it can have a transformative effect on the way we relate to our thoughts and feelings and to those around us.</p><p>TRALEG KYABGON (1955-2012) was born in eastern Tibet and educated by many great masters of all four major lineages of Tibetan Buddhism. He is the founder of the Kagyu E-Vam Buddhist Institute, which is headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, with a major practice center in New York City. He taught extensively at universities and Buddhist centers in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia beginning in 1980, and is the author of numerous books that present Buddhist teachings to Western readers, including <i>The Essence of Buddhism</i> and <i>Mind at Ease</i>.&#x201c;Karma is often a misunderstood topic in Buddhism. This clear explanation from such an eminent teacher as the late Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche, who possessed great knowledge of both dharma and the Western mind-set, will bring profound benefit to us all.&#x201d;&#x2014;Dzigar Kongtr�l Rinpoche, author of<i> It&#x2019;s Up to You</i></p><h2>Survey Methodology</h2><p><b>Praise for the <i>First Edition</i>:</b> <p>"The book makes a valuable contribution by synthesizing current research and identifying areas for future investigation for each aspect of the survey process."<br> &#x2014;<i>Journal of the American Statistical Association</i></p> <p>"Overall, the high quality of the text material is matched by the quality of writing . . ."<br> &#x2014;<i>Public Opinion Quarterly</i></p> <p>". . . it should find an audience everywhere surveys are being conducted."<br> &#x2014;<i>Technometrics</i></p> <p>This new edition of <i>Survey Methodology</i> continues to provide a state-of-the-science presentation of essential survey methodology topics and techniques.

In this book. an astonishing and transformative meditation, Kagge explores the silence around us, the silence within us, and the silence we must create. By recounting his own experiences and discussing the observations of poets, artists, and explorers, Kagge shows us why silence is essential&nbsp;to sanity and happiness&#x2014;and how it can open doors to wonder and gratitude.<br><br><i>(With full-color photographs throughout.)&nbsp;</i></p><p>Explorer, lawyer, art collector, publisher, and author, <b>ERLING KAGGE</b> is the first person to have completed the Three Poles Challenge on foot&#x2014;the North Pole, the South Pole, and the summit of Mount Everest. He has written six previous books on exploration, philosophy, and art collecting, and runs Kagge Forlag, a publishing company based in Oslo, where he lives.Whenever I am unable to walk, climb or sail away from the world, I have learned to shut it out.<br>&nbsp;<br>Learning this took time. Only when I understood that I had a primal need for silence was I able to begin my search for it&#x2014;and there, deep beneath a cacophony of traffic noise and thoughts, music and machinery, iPhones and snow ploughs, it lay in wait for me. Silence. <br>&nbsp;<br>Not long ago, I tried convincing my three daughters that the world&#x2019;s secrets are hidden inside silence. We were sitting around the kitchen table eating Sunday dinner. Nowadays it is a rare occurrence for us to eat a meal together; so much is going on all the other days of the week. Sunday dinners have become the one time when we all remain seated and talk, face-to-face. <br>&nbsp;<br>The girls looked at me sceptically. Surely silence is . . . nothing? Even before I was able to explain the way in which silence can be a friend, and a luxury more valuable than any of the Louis Vuitton bags they so covet, their minds had been made up: silence is fine to have on hand when you&#x2019;re feeling sad. Beyond that, it&#x2019;s useless. <br>&nbsp;<br>Sitting there at the dinner table, I suddenly remembered their curiosity as children. How they would wonder about what might be hiding behind a door. Their amazement as they stared at a light switch and asked me to &#x201c;open the light.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Questions and answers, questions and answers. Wonder is the very engine of life. But my children are thirteen, sixteen and nineteen years old and wonder less and less; if they still wonder at anything, they quickly pull out their smartphones to find the answer. They are still curious, but their faces are not as childish, more adult, and their heads are now filled with more ambitions than questions. None of them had any interest in discussing the subject of silence, so, in order to invoke it, I told them about two friends of mine who had decided to climb Mount Everest. <br>&nbsp;<br>Early one morning they left base camp to climb the southwest wall of the mountain. It was going well. Both reached the summit, but then came the storm. They soon realized they would not make it down alive. The first got hold of his pregnant wife via satellite phone. Together they decided on the name of the child that she was carrying. Then he quietly passed away just below the summit. My other friend was not able to contact anyone before he died. No one knows exactly what happened on the mountain in those hours. Thanks to the dry, cool climate 8,000 metres above sea level, they have both been freeze-dried. They lie there in silence, looking no different, more or less, from the way they were last time I saw them, twenty-two years ago. <br>&nbsp;<br>For once there was silence around the table. One of our mobile phones pinged with an incoming message, but none of us thought to check our phones just then. Instead, we filled the silence with ourselves. <br>&nbsp;<br>Not long afterwards, I was invited to give a lecture at St. Andrew&#x2019;s University in Scotland. I was to choose the subject myself. I tended to talk about extreme journeys to the ends of the earth, but this time my thoughts turned homewards, to that Sunday supper with my family. So I settled on the topic of silence. I prepared myself well but was, as I often am, nervous beforehand. What if scattered thoughts about silence belonged only in the realm of Sunday dinners, and not in student forums? It was not that I expected to be booed for the eighteen minutes of my lecture, but I wanted the students to be interested in the subject I held so close to my heart.<br>&nbsp;<br>I began the lecture with a minute of silence. You could have heard a pin drop. It was stock-still. For the next seventeen minutes I spoke about <i>the silence around us, </i>but I also talked about something that is even more important to me, <i>the silence within us</i>. The students remained quiet. Listening. It seemed as though they had been missing silence.<br>&nbsp;<br>That same evening, I went out to a pub with a few of them. Inside the draughty entrance, each of us with a pint of beer, it was all more or less exactly the same as my student days at Cambridge. Kind, curious people, a humming atmosphere, interesting conversations. <i>What is silence? Where is it? Why is it more important now than ever? </i>were three questions they wanted answered. <br>&nbsp;<br>That evening meant a lot to me, and not only for the good company. Thanks to the students I realized how little I understood. Back home I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about those three questions. They became an obsession. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>What is silence? Where is it? Why is it more important now than ever?</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Every evening I&#x2019;d sit, puzzling over them. I began writing, thinking and reading, more for myself than anyone else. By the end of my search I&#x2019;d come up with thirty-three attempts at answering them.</p><h2>That Was Then, This Is Now</h2><p><b>Another classic from the author of the internationally bestselling&nbsp;<i>The Outsiders</i></b><p>Continue celebrating 50 years of<i> The Outsiders</i> by reading this&nbsp;companion novel.&nbsp;<i>That Was Then</i>, <i>This is Now</i> is S.

Parker&#x2019;s iconic <i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling series.<br></b><br>The fire at a boarded-up Catholic church raged hot and fast, lighting up Boston&#x2019;s South End and killing three firefighters who were trapped in the inferno. A year later, as the city prepares to honor their sacrifice, there are still no answers about how the deadly fire started. Most at the department believe it was just a simple accident: faulty wiring in a century-old building. But Boston firefighter Jack McGee, who lost his best friend in the blaze, suspects arson. <br><br>McGee is convinced department investigators aren&#x2019;t sufficiently connected to the city&#x2019;s lowlifes to get a handle on who's behind the blaze&#x2014;so he takes the case to Spenser. Spenser quickly learns not only that McGee might be right, but that the fire might be linked to a rash of new arsons, spreading through the city, burning faster and hotter every night. Spenser follows the trail of fires to Boston&#x2019;s underworld, bringing him, his trusted ally Hawk, and his apprentice Sixkill toe-to-toe with a dangerous new enemy who wants Spenser dead, and doesn&#x2019;t play by the city&#x2019;s old rules.

Before turning to fiction, he was a correspondent for the<i>&nbsp;St. Petersburg Times</i>, a crime reporter for the<i>&nbsp;Tampa Tribune</i>, and, in college, played defensive end for the undefeated Auburn University football team (for which he was featured on the cover of&nbsp;<i>Sports Illustrated</i>). He lives in Oxford, Mississippi.<b><i>1</i></b><br> The Harbor Health Club had returned to its roots.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only was boxing allowed, it was now encouraged by Henry Cimoli. For a waterfront gym that had weathered both urban renewal and Zumba, the time had come. Henry and I took a break from the boxing ring and watched a dozen or so young professionals, men and women, listen to a Cree Indian from Montana teach them how to deliver a left jab.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry had a welded cage built in the expanse of what had been the workout room, heavy bags swinging from the platform. Half the gym was now boxing, the other half free weights and Crossfit gear. Hawk and I were quite pleased. Not to mention Z, whom Henry had employed for the last two years and had ushered in the new era.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to do all of this for us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I did it for Mr. Green,&#x201d; he said, rubbing his thumb and two fingers together. &#x201c;What makes the world go &#x2018;round.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What if aerobics come back in style?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring in fucking monkeys on unicycles if it&#x2019;ll keep this gym open,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If you hadn&#x2019;t noticed, this building isn&#x2019;t on Skid Row anymore.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I could tell by the yachts moored outside,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I pick up on subtle clues like that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We leaned against the ropes, like cowboys on a split rail fence, watching Z help a fit young woman in a pink sports bra throw a left hook. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;To be young,&#x201d; Henry said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>The moments passed as at a play</i>,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And I have the ex-wives to prove it,&#x201d; Henry said, letting himself out of the ropes and down the short steps. He walked over to help Z instruct the lithe young woman. I admired his commitment. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent a half hour on a treadmill, showered, and changed into my street clothes: Levi&#x2019;s, black pocket T-shirt, and a pair of tan suede desert boots. As I was headed to the street, a rotund man in a gray sweatshirt whistled for me. He&#x2019;d been running the dumbbell rack with biceps curls, his fat face flushed and sweaty. <br> Jack McGee wiped a towel over his neck and said, &#x201c;Christ, Spenser. I been waiting for you all freakin&#x2019; morning.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nice to be needed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shook his wet hand. Jack sweated a lot. He was a short, thick guy with Irish written all over his face. I&#x2019;d known him for many years, and in the many I&#x2019;d known him he&#x2019;d been a Boston firefighter. Being a firefighter was more than a job for Jack, it was a calling.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I got a problem,&#x201d; he said. Whispering, although most of Henry&#x2019;s clients were in the boxing room.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Superset your bis and tris,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Work the dumbbells with press downs.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you busy with anything right now?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shrugged. &#x201c;I just finished an insurance fraud case,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m always on standby for the big S projected into the clouds over Boston.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Well, I got a big fucking S for you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;As in the shit has hit the fan.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m familiar with that S.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s this thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There&#x2019;s always a thing,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Can we talk outside?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; McGee followed me out to my newish blue Explorer. I tossed my gym bag into the back and leaned against door with my arms folded over my chest. I had worked out hard and my biceps bulged from my T-shirt. I feared if I stood there any longer, I might be accosted by passing women.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You know about the fire last year?&#x201d; McGee said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone knew about the fire last year. Three firefighters had died at an old church in the South End. The funeral Mass had been televised on local TV. There had been an inquiry. I&#x2019;d never spoken to Jack about it other than offer my condolences. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;For the last year, I&#x2019;ve been saying it was arson,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But no one&#x2019;s been arrested and I hear things have stalled out. It&#x2019;s always tomorrow with those guys. And now we&#x2019;re getting shit burning nearly every night. This city&#x2019;s got an arsonist loose and no one wants to admit it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You think it&#x2019;s connected to the church?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Damn right,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But no one is saying shit in the department. I lost my best friend Pat Dougherty in that church. We went through the academy together. Then at Engine 33, Ladder 15 for the first three years. Godfather to his kids. Same neighborhood. Jesus, you know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded again. I told him I was very sorry.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mike Mulligan hadn&#x2019;t been on the job but six months,&#x201d; McGee said. &#x201c;A rake. An open-up man. His dad was a fireman. He was a Marine like me. Saw some shit over in Afghanistan only to come home and get killed.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I opened up the driver&#x2019;s door and let the windows down. It was June and the morning had grown warm. No one was complaining. We&#x2019;d just survived the longest, snowiest winter since Grant was president. &#x201c;Why do you think the church is connected to the new fires?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Call it firemen&#x2019;s intuition.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Got anything more than that?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That church wasn&#x2019;t an accident,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Everybody knows it. Arson sifted through that shit pile for months. No signs of electrical or accidental. It&#x2019;s a fucking fire of unknown origin. How&#x2019;s that sit with Pat&#x2019;s wife and kids?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Arson investigation is a pretty specialized field,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Most of the clues burn up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need more samples and microscopes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay you &#x2018;cause you know the worst people in the city. Some scum who&#x2019;d do something like this. Burn a fucking Catholic church and then keep burning through Southie and the South End until they&#x2019;re caught.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Over the years, I&#x2019;ve met a few people of questionable breeding.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Freakin&#x2019; criminals,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;I want you to shake the bushes for criminals and find out who set this and why.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Follow the money?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What else could it be?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I leaned my forearms against my open door. My case load had waned over the months while my checking account had fattened. Corporations paid more than people. I had few reasons to spurn the offer. Not to mention, Jack McGee was an honorable man who&#x2019;d asked for help.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;OK,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Will you introduce me around?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You start making noise at headquarters and the commissioner will have my ass,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;All I need is for the commissioner and the chief to get pissed while I&#x2019;m doing my last few years. I made captain. Got a pension. I got a great firehouse in the North End. I don&#x2019;t want to make waves. I just want some answers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No official inquiries?&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No pressure on arson investigators?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to have to go around your ass to get to your elbow on this one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yikes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That sounds painful.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But can you do it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve taken that route many times before.&#x201d;<br><br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>2</i></b><br> &#x201c;To what do I owe this honor?&#x201d; Quirk said. &#x201c;Did you just shoot some poor bastard while cleaning your revolver?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I just stopped by to admire your new office,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Check out your breathtaking view. Congratulate you on your promotion.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Deputy Superintendent Quirk has a nice ring to it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s ceremonial,&#x201d; Quirk said. &#x201c;I meet with neighborhood groups. Do press briefings and photo ops.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saluted him. &#x201c;Does this mean I can finally meet McGruff the Crime Dog?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell him to hump your leg. After this long on the job, a little boost is appreciated. Might finally be able to retire. Move down to Florida. Get a boat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Not in in your nature.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Neither was this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s what I got.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And Belson?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Training the new captain in investigative techniques.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;God help her.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Amen,&#x201d; Quirk said, leaning into his desk. His hands were as thick and strong as a bricklayer&#x2019;s. His salt-and-pepper hair looked to have been trimmed that morning. White dress shirt double starched. Red tie affixed with a gold clip. I knew his wingtips were polished so bright they&#x2019;d blind me. &#x201c;So what the hell do you want?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There was a fire last year,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;A nine-alarm in the South End at the Holy Innocents Catholic Church.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, I know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You worked the deaths?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course I did,&#x201d; Quirk said. &#x201c;You might recall I once ran homicide. We investigate all fatal fires. You know that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And what did you learn?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Jack and shit,&#x201d; he said, picking up the square plastic picture frame on his desk. He turned it around in his big hands to study his wife, kids, and numerous grandchildren. He waited a few beats and then leveled his gaze at me. If it was at all possible, his face had hardened in the years I&#x2019;d known him. Not flesh and bone. More like carved granite. &#x201c;Whattya know?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see the interviews.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It was a fire,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Go talk to fucking Fire.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I would,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s an open investigation. I hoped Boston police might have many of the same files.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, well,&#x201d; Quick said. &#x201c;We just might.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;As you said, it&#x2019;s an open investigation, hot shot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smiled and shrugged. Quirk frowned.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You working with a jake?&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Perhaps.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A jake who doesn&#x2019;t want people to know he&#x2019;s working with the nosiest snoop in the Back Bay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I prefer the most winning profile.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;If I had a nose like that, I wouldn&#x2019;t be one to brag.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Character,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Built of character.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And plenty of cotton shoved up your schnoz,&#x201d; Quirk said. He put down the plastic square and pushed back from his desk. He folded his big hands over his chest. &#x201c;Arson isn&#x2019;t too keen on a guy like you butting into their business.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I will tread lightly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Yeah, sure. How&#x2019;s Susan?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Charming and gorgeous and ever.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Pearl?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;...</p><h2>Theory of the Gimmick: Aesthetic Judgment and Capitalist Form</h2><p><p><b>A provocative theory of the gimmick as an aesthetic category steeped in the anxieties of capitalism.</b></p><p>Repulsive and yet strangely attractive, the gimmick is a form that can be found virtually everywhere in capitalism. It comes in many guises: a musical hook, a financial strategy, a striptease, a novel of ideas. Above all, acclaimed theorist Sianne Ngai argues, the gimmick strikes us both as working too little (a labor-saving trick) and as working too hard (a strained effort to get our attention).</p><p>Focusing on this connection to work, Ngai draws a line from gimmicks to political economy. When we call something a gimmick, we are registering uncertainties about value bound to labor and time&#x2015;misgivings that indicate broader anxieties about the measurement of wealth in capitalism. With wit and critical precision, Ngai explores the extravagantly impoverished gimmick across a range of examples: the fiction of Thomas Mann, Helen DeWitt, and Henry James; photographs by Torbj�rn R�dland; the video art of Stan Douglas; the theoretical writings of Stanley Cavell and Theodor Adorno. Despite its status as cheap and compromised, the gimmick emerges as a surprisingly powerful tool in this formidable contribution to aesthetic theory.</p></p><p>Sianne Ngai is Professor of English at the University of Chicago. She is the author of <i>Ugly Feelings</i> and <i>Our Aesthetic Categories: Zany, Cute, Interesting,</i> winner of the Modern Language Association&#x2019;s James Russell Lowell Prize. Her work has been translated into multiple languages, and she has received fellowships from the Institute of Advanced Study in Berlin and the American Council of Learned Societies.</p><h2>Guests of the Sheik: An Ethnography of an Iraqi Village</h2><p>A delightful, well-written, and vastly informative ethnographic study, this is an account of Fernea's two-year stay in a tiny rural village in Iraq, where she assumed the dress and sheltered life of a harem woman.

Yet somehow, this normal boy became one of the youngest people on whom Dr. Walter Freeman performed his barbaric transorbital&#x2014;or ice pick&#x2014;lobotomy.</p><p>Abandoned by his family within a year of the surgery, Howard spent his teen years in mental institutions, his twenties in jail, and his thirties in a bottle. It wasn&#x2019;t until he was in his forties that Howard began to pull his life together. But even as he began to live the &#x201c;normal&#x201d; life he had been denied, Howard struggled with one question: Why?</p><p>There were only three people who would know the truth: Freeman, the man who performed the procedure; Lou, his cold and demanding stepmother who brought Howard to the doctor&#x2019;s attention; and his father, Rodney. Of the three, only Rodney, the man who hadn&#x2019;t intervened on his son&#x2019;s behalf, was still living. Time was running out.

My parents were Rodney Lloyd Dully and June Louise Pierce Dully. I was their first child, and they named me Howard August Dully, after my father&#x2019;s father. Rodney was twenty-three. June was thirty-four.<br><br>They had been married less than a year. Their wedding was held on Sunday, December 28, 1947, three days after Christmas, at one o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon, at the Westminster Presbyterian Church in Sacramento, California. The wedding photographs show an eager, nervous couple. He&#x2019;s in white tie and tails, with a white carnation in his lapel. She&#x2019;s in white satin, and a veil decorated with white flowers. They are both dark-haired and dark-eyed. Together they are cutting the cake&#x2014;staring at the cake, not at each other&#x2014;and smiling.<br><br>A reception followed at 917 Forty-fifth Street, at the home of my mother&#x2019;s uncle Ross and aunt Ruth Pierce. My father&#x2019;s mother attended. So did his two brothers. One of them, his younger brother, Kenneth, wore a tuxedo all the way up from San Jose on the train.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s relatives were railroad workers and lumberjack types from the area around Chehalis and Centralia, Washington. My dad spent his summers in a lumber camp with one of his uncles. They were logging people.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s father was an immigrant, born in 1899 in a place called Revel, Estonia, in what would later be the Soviet Union. When he left Estonia, his name was August Tulle. When he got to America, where he joined his brothers, Alexander and John&#x2014; he had two sisters, Marja and Lovisa, whom he left behind in Estonia&#x2014;he was called August Dully. He later added the first name Howard, because it sounded American to him.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s mother was the child of immigrants from Ireland. She was born Beulah Belle Cowan in Litchfield, Michigan, in 1902. Her family later moved to Portland, Oregon, in time for Beulah to attend high school, where she was so smart she skipped two grades.<br><br>August went to Portland, too, because that&#x2019;s where his brothers were. According to his World War I draft registration card, he was brown-haired, blue-eyed, and of medium height. He got work as a window dresser for the Columbia River Ship Company. He became a mason. He met the redheaded Beulah at a dance. She told her mother that night, &#x201c;I just met the man I&#x2019;m going to marry.&#x201d; She was sixteen. A short while later, they tied the knot and took a freighter to San Francisco for their honeymoon, and stayed. A 1920 U.S. Census survey shows them living in an apartment building on Fourth Street. Howard A. Dully was now a naturalized citizen, working as a laborer in the shipyards.<br><br>Sometime after, they moved to Washington, where my grandfather went to work on the railroads. They started having sons&#x2014;Eugene, Rodney, and Kenneth&#x2014;before August got sick with tuberculosis. Beulah believed he caught it on that freighter going to San Francisco. He died at home, in bed, on New Year&#x2019;s Day, 1929. My dad was three years old. His baby brother was only fourteen months old.<br><br>Beulah Belle never remarried. She was hardheaded and strong-willed. She said, &#x201c;I will never again have a man tell me what to do.&#x201d;<br><br>But she had a hard time taking care of her family. She couldn&#x2019;t keep up payments on the house. When she lost it, the boys went to stay with relatives. My dad was sent to live with an aunt and uncle at age six, and was shuffled from place to place after that. By his own account, he lived in six different cities before he finished high school&#x2014;born in Centralia, Washington; then shipped around Oregon to Marshfield, Grants Pass, Medford, and Eugene; then to Ryderwood, Washington, where he and his brother Kenneth lived in a logging camp with their former housekeeper Evelyn Townsend and her husband, Orville Black.<br><br>At eighteen, Rod left Washington to serve with the U.S. Army, enlisting in San Francisco on December 9, 1943. Though he later was reluctant to talk about it, I know from my uncles that he was sent overseas and stationed in France. He served with the 723rd Railroad Division, laying track in an area near L&#x2019;Aigle, France, that was surrounded by mines. One of my uncles told me that my father never recovered from the war. He said, &#x201c;The man who went away to France never came back. He was damaged by what he saw there.&#x201d;<br><br>But another of my uncles told me Rod bragged about having a German girlfriend, so I guess it wasn&#x2019;t all bad. Not as bad as his brother Gene, who joined the army and got sent to Australia and New Guinea, where he developed malaria and tuberculosis and almost died. He weighed one hundred pounds when he came back to America, and lived at a military hospital in Livermore, California, for a long time after that.<br><br>By the time Rod finished his military service, his mother had left her job with Western Union Telegraph, in the Northwest, and moved to Oakland to work for the Southern Pacific Railroad. She was later made a night supervisor, working in the San Francisco office on Market Street. She would still be working there when I was born.<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s folks came from the other end of the economic spectrum. June was the daughter of Daisy Seulberger and Hubert O. Pierce&#x2014;German on her mother&#x2019;s side, English on her father&#x2019;s. Daisy grew up weatlthy, married Pierce, and had three children: Gordon, June, and Hugh. When Pierce died, Daisy married Delos Patrician, another wealthy Bay Area businessman. She moved her family to Oakland, into a huge, three-story shingled home on Newton Avenue. June spent her childhood there.<br><br>After his military service, my father relocated to the Bay Area and started taking classes at San Francisco Junior College, learning to be a teacher and doing his undergraduate work in elementary education.<br><br>Over the summers, he got part-time work at a popular high Sierras vacation spot, Tuolumne Meadows, in Yosemite. He met a young woman there, working as a housekeeper, who captured his eye. Her name was June.<br><br>She was tall, dark, and athletic, and for Rod she was a real catch. She was a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, where she had been active with the Alpha Xi Delta sorority, and had a certificate to teach nursery school. She was from a well-known Oakland family, and for several years she had been a fixture on the local social scene. During the war she had worked in Washington, D.C., as a private secretary to the U.S. congressman from her district. When she returned to Oakland, she often had her name in the newspapers, hosting luncheons and teas for her society friends.<br><br>She had been courted by quite a few young men, but her controlling mother, Daisy, drove all the boyfriends away. When she met Rod, June was still beautiful, but she was no longer what you&#x2019;d call young, especially not at that time. She was thirty-two. Being unmarried at that age during the 1940s was almost like being a spinster.<br><br>Their courtship was sudden and passionate. They fell in love over the summer of 1946, and saw each other in San Francisco and Berkeley through the next year. When June returned to work in Yosemite in the summer of &#x2019;47, this time at Glen Aulin Camp, Rod left for the lumberyards of northern California and southern Oregon, where he was determined to make enough money to marry June in style. His letters over that summer were eager and filled with love. He was full of plans and promises&#x2014;for his career, their wedding, the house he would buy her, the family they would have. He was worried that he was not the man June&#x2019;s mother wanted, or from the right level of society, but he was determined to prove himself. &#x201c;I expect to make you happy. I won&#x2019;t marry you and take you into a life you won&#x2019;t be happy in,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy now, much happier than I&#x2019;ve ever been before in my life, cause you&#x2019;re my little dream girl and my dream is coming true.&#x201d;<br><br>After a hard summer of logging work, the plans for the wedding were made. The ceremony was held three days after Christmas in Sacramento. According to a newspaper story a week later, the couple was &#x201c;honeymooning in Carmel&#x201d; after a ceremony in which &#x201c;the bride wore a white satin gown with a sweetheart neckline, long sleeves ending in points at the wrists and full skirt with a double peplum pointed at the front. Her full-length veil of silk net was attached to a bandeau of seed pearls and orange blossoms. She also carried a handkerchief which has been in her family for 75 years.&#x201d;<br><br>The bride was given away by her uncle Ross, in whose Sacramento house she had been living. The groom&#x2019;s best man was his brother Kenneth.<br><br>According to family stories, some of June&#x2019;s family objected. Rod was too young for June, Daisy said, and didn&#x2019;t have good prospects. June may have been uncomfortable with the relative poverty she was marrying into, too. My dad later told people that he got into a fender bender not long after he met June, and that his feelings were hurt when she said she was embarrassed to be seen driving around in his banged-up car.<br><br>With a wife to support, my father left school. He and my mother moved up north, to Medford, Oregon, where Rod returned to the lumber business and went to work as a lumber tallyman with the Southern Oregon Sugar Pine Corporation in Central Point, two miles outside of Medford.<br><br>Soon the young married couple had a baby on the way&#x2014;me. Near the end of her term, my mother left my dad in Medford and moved in with her mother in Oakland, a pattern she would repeat for the births of all her children.<br><br>If everything had gone as planned, she probably would have returned to Medford and raised a family.<br><br>But my father had some bad luck. One morning on a work break he became incoherent and had to be taken by ambulance to a Medford hospital. He was treated for sun stroke and sent back to work. When his symptoms returned, he saw another doctor and was treated for heat stroke. When he still did not improve, Rod left Medford and went to live with June&#x2019;s family in the big house in Oakland. He recovered but was told not to resume any kind of hard, physical outdoor work. The lumber business was over for him. He would never return to the Northwest.<br><br>I was carried to full term, according to the birth records, and I was a normal, healthy child, delivered early in the morning by a doctor named John Henry. I was a big baby&#x2014;nine pounds and twenty-four inches long. (I come by that naturally. My parents were both big. My mother was six feet and my father was six feet three inches. My younger brother, Brian, is six feet ten inches.) Photo- graphs of me when I was a baby show a big, goofy-looking infant with bright eyes and a healthy appetite. In one picture I am reaching out for a slice of cake. My father says I was a cheerful, happy, friendly baby who was doted upon by his mother.<br><br>They gave me my grandfather&#x2019;s adopted American name&#x2014;Howard August Dully. To this day my uncle Kenneth says I&#x2019;m the one Dully who looks most like him.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s occupation was listed on my birth certificate as &#x201c;Talley man, Southern Sugar Pine Lumber Co., Medford, Ore.&#x201d; But he never went back to that job. After my birth, he moved his new family into a one-bedroom apartment at Spartan Village, a low-income student-housing complex near San Jose State University. He got a sales job at San Jose Lumber, a lumberyard right down the street from our apartment, and resumed his studies at the university.<br><br>I have very few memories of living at Spartan Village. The clearest one is a memory of fear. There was a playground there and my dad built me a choo-choo train out of fifty-gallon oil drums and lumber. I was proud of it, and proud that my dad had built it.<br><br>But there was a big, open field of weeds next to the apartment complex. I was afraid of that field. I was afraid of what was in those weeds. There was a low place in the center of the field that kids would run into and disappear. I was afraid they wouldn&#x2019;t come out. I knew that if I went into that field I would fall in and not be able to come out. It&#x2019;s the first thing in my life I remember being afraid of.<br><br>In August 1951, when I was two and a half years old, Rodney and June had another son. They named him Brian. Like me, he was born healthy. I now had a roommate in our Spartan Village apartment.<br><br>In some families, the arrival of the second son is the end of the world for the first son, because now he has to share his mother with a stranger. Not in my family. My dad said Brian&#x2019;s birth did not have any impact on my close relationship with June. He was responsi- ble for Brian, while she concentrated all her love on me. &#x201c;I was the one taking care of Brian,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;All she cared about was little Howard.&#x201d;<br><br>My father told me later that I was the most important person in my mother&#x2019;s life&#x2014;more important, even, than him. I was the number-one son. &#x201c;I could&#x2019;ve dropped dead and it wouldn&#x2019;t have made a bit of difference,&#x201d; my dad said. &#x201c;She had you.&#x201d;<br><br>When he completed his degree, my father was hired as an elementary school teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in a little town called Pollock Pines in the Sierras, about halfway between Sacramento and Lake Tahoe.<br><br>Most of my early childhood memories come from this place. Our house sat on a hill that sloped down to a bend in Highway 50, the two-lane road that led from Sacramento to Lake Tahoe. We had a little cocker spaniel named Blackie. He was hit by a car on that road, and killed, when I was about two years old.<br><br>I also remember sitting in a coffee shop in Placerville, having a soda with my mother. We were waiting for my father. Music was playing.<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s uncle Ross and aunt Ruth had a huge mountain cabin, so big it was more like a hunting lodge, farther up Highway 50, near a famous old resort called Little Norway. It had been built by my great-grandfather&#x2014;Grandma Daisy&#x2019;s father&#x2014;in the 1930s. The main building, which was two stories and filled with moose heads, was surrounded by pine trees and smaller cabins that were so primitive they had dirt floors. We used to stay in one of them when I was little.<br><br>In the winter, the snow was so deep we cut steps in it and climbed onto the cabin roof. Later on I learned to ski there, but my earliest memories of the snow are unhappy ones. I stepped into a snow drift that was so deep I sank in up to my waist and couldn&#x2019;t get out. This frightened me. I thought some kind of snow monster was going to come and eat me, and I began to cry.<br><br>My father thought it was the funniest thing he&#x2019;d ever seen. I was terrified, but he was laughing. That made me mad at him.<br><br>I think I was a happy child. I remember walking the two blocks from our apartment to my father&#x2019;s work every day, my mother carrying the sack lunch she&#x2019;d made for him. But I also remember not liking the way my mother made me dress. I had to wear colored shirts, and those little shorts that have straps to hold them up. They looked like those German lederhosen. Even as a kid I thought they were lame. I probably wanted to wear blue jeans.<br><br>My mother liked being a mother and she took naturally to it. In my favorite picture of her from that time, she&#x2019;s wearing a cap-sleeve shirt, a wide black belt, and a billowing skirt, and she&#x2019;s standing under a clothesline in the Spartan Village yard. She looks like she&#x2019;s calling to me, and she looks happy.<br><br>Family members have told me that she enjoyed life and laughed a lot. She wasn&#x2019;t serious, like my dad. She was more carefree, and liked to have fun.<br><br>In my memory, she was a very loving and indulgent mother. I remember being held and hugged and kissed by her. I remember being loved. I have fleeting pictures in my head of green grass, of sunshine, of running past my mother&#x2019;s full skirts. I remember her laughing.<br><br>My father was ...</p><h2>Religion in American Life: A Short History</h2><p>"Quite ambitious, tracing religion in the United States from European colonization up to the 21st century....

If the prose sounds familiar, it's because these three sections were originally issued as three separate books for the young adult nonfiction market; they have been gathered together here as one survey.

And as one ends his century, and the next takes the baton as if a relay race, they overlap on some events and give them different emphases....This is not a Christian history, though that faith naturally predominates. The homage to minorities strikes a good balance, and is not the forced multiculturalism seen in some textbooks....For a weekend reader who feels beind on a half millennia of American faith adventures, they can be brought up to speed in a fortnight, and certainly before the Apocalypse." -- Larry Witham, <em>Washington Times</em><p></p><br>"This 'short history,' authored by three of the leading scholars in the field, provides an excellent overview of religion in American history." -- Bryan F.

Liam and I laugh, and Mama laughs too. We call Papa the Weather Man.<br> <br>And suddenly, as if his words bring it on, snow begins to fall; flakes one by one, slowly at first, then harder. Papa turns on the windshield wipers, and we watch the back-and-forthing of them.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hope the library stays open if it snows,&#x201d; says Liam.<br> <br>&#x201c;That library is always open,&#x201d; says Mama. &#x201c;That library has been open ever since I was a little girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>We turn into the long dirt driveway to Grandpa and Gran&#x2019;s house, past the meadow where White Cow turns her head to watch us go by.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Rosie?&#x201d; asks Liam. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the donkey?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; says Mama. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t see her.&#x201d;<br> <br>The snow is coming harder now and is beginning to stick to the road. It is almost dusk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you bring your money?&#x201d; asks Liam.<br> <br>I nod.<br> <br>We have worked weekends and after school to earn money for Christmas presents. I babysat for the three Cooper children across the street. Liam and I both mowed lawns and shoveled snow when it came. Once he painted a shed. There are only two stores in Gran and Grandpa&#x2019;s small town. But that is enough for us to buy presents for everyone.<br> <br>Liam holds up a red sock with a gray stripe. It is fat with his money.<br> <br>I smile. The car passes the barn and pulls up to the front porch of the big white house. There are Christmas lights in every window. Gran and Grandpa come out to wave. Their terriers, Emmet and Charlie, bark fiercely at us, then race down the porch steps happily for jumping and licking.<br> <br>Snow falls harder.<br> <br>We&#x2019;re here!</p><h2>The Hidden Manna: A Theology of the Eucharist</h2><p>The Hidden Manna has become a classic on Eucharistic teaching. Now in a second edition, accompanied by a new introduction by Fr. Kenneth Baker, a new preface from the author, new material from John Paul II, and the original foreword by Cardinal John O&#39;Connor, this in-depth study lets the breadth and richness of the Church&#39;s Tradition speak for itself. Fr. O&#39;Connor presents and comments on substantial excerpts from the major sources of the Church&#39;s Tradition extending all the way back to apostolic times. Focusing on the doctrine of the Real Presence, he follows the earliest witnesses through the challenge in the Middle Ages of Berengarius through the Protestant Reformation and modern disputes.</p><p></p><h2>How to Think Like a Scientist: Answering Questions by the Scientific Method</h2><p><p> Every day you answer questions-dozens, even hundreds of them.

His book <b><i>The Quest for Community</i></b>, published in 1953, stands as one of the most persuasive accounts of the dilemmas confronting modern society.</p><p>Nearly a half century before Robert Putnam documented the atomization of society in <i>Bowling Alone</i>, Nisbet argued that the rise of the powerful modern state had eroded the sources of community&#x2014;the family, the neighborhood, the church, the guild. Alienation and loneliness inevitably resulted. But as the traditional ties that bind fell away, the human impulse toward community led people to turn even more to the government itself, allowing statism&#x2014;even totalitarianism&#x2014;to flourish.</p><p>ISI Books is proud to present this new edition of Nisbet&#x2019;s magnum opus, featuring a brilliant introduction by <i>New York Times </i>columnist Ross Douthat and three critical essays.

A decade later, Morrie is back in Montana, as the beguiling narrator of <i>Work Song</i>. <br><br> Lured like so many others by "the richest hill on earth," Morrie steps off the train in Butte, copper-mining capital of the world, in its jittery heyday of 1919. But while riches elude Morrie, once again a colorful cast of local characters-and their dramas-seek him out: a look-alike, sound-alike pair of retired Welsh miners; a streak-of-lightning waif so skinny that he is dubbed Russian Famine; a pair of mining company goons; a comely landlady propitiously named Grace; and an eccentric boss at the public library, his whispered nickname a source of inexplicable terror. When Morrie crosses paths with a lively former student, now engaged to a fiery young union leader, he is caught up in the mounting clash between the iron-fisted mining company, radical "outside agitators," and the beleaguered miners. And as tensions above ground and below reach the explosion point, Morrie finds a unique way to give a voice to those who truly need one. <br><br>Watch a Video<p> </p></p><p>Ivan Doig was born in Montana and grew up along the Rocky Mountain Front, the dramatic landscape that has inspired much of his writing. A former ranch hand, newspaperman, and magazine editor, with a Ph.D. in history, Doig is the author of nine previous novels, most recently <i>The Whistling Season</i> and <i>The Eleventh Man</i>, and three works of nonfiction, including his classic first book, the memoir <i>This House of Sky</i>. He has been a National Book Award finalist and has received the Wallace Stegner Award, a Distinguished Achievement Award from the Western Literature Association, and multiple PNBA and MPBA Book Awards, among other honors. He lives in Seattle."A genuinely sweet book by a writer who is generous to his characters and readers alike...start to finish Morrie proves a character in the best sense of the word...He's awfully good company...a character with whom it's a pleasure to pass the time no matter the scenery." <br> -<i>Missoula Independent</i> <br><br> "Entertaining for its rich historical take on the town of Butte...and for its evocative descriptions." <br> -Bookpage E-Newsletter <br><br> "A classic tale from the heyday of American capitalism by the king of the Western novel." <br> -<i>The Daily Beast (Hot Reads)</i> <br><br> "As enjoyable and subtly thought-provoking a piece of fiction as you're likely to pick up this summer. It's a book that can be appreciated just for the quality of the prose and the author's adherence to the sturdy conventions of old- fashioned narrative or for Doig's sly gloss on Western genre fiction and unforced evocation of our current condition - or, better yet, for all those things...One of this novel's pleasures is the rich cast of secondary characters Doig effortlessly sketches into his narrative...a pleasure to read." <br> -<i>The Los Angeles Times </i> <br><br> "Relax and allow yourself to be re-absorbed into a way of life that is, day by day, being lost to strip malls and strip mining...As in his previous novels, Doig excels at his descriptions of both characters and the land. ..It's hard to keep a smile off your face as you're working your way through this book. Nostalgia has found a happy home here." <br> -<i>New West (starred review) </i> <br><br> "If you were looking for a novel that best expresses the American spirit, you'd have to ride past a lot of fence posts before finding anything as worthy as <i>Work Song</i>. <br> -<i>Chicago Tribune </i> <br><br> "Not one stictch unravels in this intricately threaded narrative ... infectious." <br> -<i>The New York Times Book Review </i> <br><br> "Readers who fell in love with Morrie Morgan in The Whistling Season will welcome him back to Montana in Ivan Doig's latest adventure.

Having led us on the way up, Detroit now seems to be leading us on the way down. Once the richest city in America, Detroit is now the nation&#x2019;s poorest. Once the vanguard of America&#x2019;s machine age&#x2014;mass-production, blue-collar jobs, and automobiles&#x2014;Detroit is now America&#x2019;s capital for unemployment, illiteracy, dropouts, and foreclosures. With the steel-eyed reportage that has become his trademark, and the righteous indignation only a native son possesses, LeDuff sets out to uncover what destroyed his city. He beats on the doors of union bosses and homeless squatters, powerful businessmen and struggling homeowners and the ordinary people holding the city together by sheer determination. <i>Detroit: An American Autopsy</i> is an unbelievable story of a hard town in a rough time filled with some of the strangest and strongest people our country has to offer.</p><p><b>Charlie LeDuff </b>is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist, formerly at the <i>New</i> <i>York Times</i> and the <i>Detroit News</i>, and currently on Detroit&#x2019;s <i>Fox 2 News</i>.

But definitely human.<br><br>&#x201c;Goddamn.&#x201d;<br><br>I took a deep breath through my cigarette. I didn&#x2019;t want to use my nose. It was late January, the air scorching cold. The snow was falling sideways as it usually did in Detroit this time of year. The dead man was encased in at least four feet of ice at the bottom of a defunct elevator shaft in an abandoned building. But still, there was no telling what the stink might be like.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t make out his face. The only things protruding above the ice were the feet, dressed in some white sweat socks and a pair of black gym shoes. I could see the hem of his jacket below the surface. The rest of him tapered off into the void.<br><br>In most cities, a death scene like this would be considered remarkable, mind-blowing, horrifying. But not here. Something had happened in Detroit while I was away.<br>I had left the city two decades earlier to try to make a life for myself that didn&#x2019;t involve a slow death working in a chemical factory or a liquor store. Any place but those places.<br><br>But where? I wandered for years, working my way across Asia, Europe, the Arctic edge working as a cannery hand, a carpenter, a drifter. And then I settled into the most natural thing for a man with no real talents.<br><br>Journalism.<br><br>It required no expertise, no family connections and no social graces. Furthermore, it seemed to be the only job that paid you to travel, excluding a door-to-door Bible salesman. Nearly thirty years old, I went back to school to study the inverted pyramid of writing. I landed my first newspaper job with the <i>Alaska Fisherman&#x2019;s Journal</i>, where I wrote dispatches in longhand on legal pads and mailed them back to headquarters in Seattle.<br><br>So I went out into the Last Frontier with my notepad and a tent and wrote what I saw: stuff about struggling fishermen, a mountain woman who drank too much and dried her panties on a line stretched across the bow of her boat, Mexican laborers forced to live in the swamps, a prince who lived under a bridge, a gay piano man on a fancy cruise liner. People managing somehow. My kind of people. The job suited me.<br><br>Working off that, I tried to land a real job but couldn&#x2019;t find one. The <i>Detroit Free Press</i> didn&#x2019;t want me. Not the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>. Not the <i>Oakland Tribune</i>. I was thinking about returning to the Alaskan fishing boats until a little Podunk paper called me with an offer of a summer internship&#x2014; the <i>New York Times</i>.<br><br>Luck counts too.<br><br>I ended up working at the Gray Lady for a decade, sketching the lives of hustlers and working stiffs and firemen at Ground Zero. It was a good run. But wanderlust is like a pretty girl&#x2014;you wake up one morning, find she&#x2019;s grown old and decide that either you&#x2019;re going to commit your life or you&#x2019;re going to walk away. I walked away, and as it happens in life, I circled home, taking a job with the <i>Detroit News</i>. My colleagues in New York laughed. The paper was on death watch. And so was the city.<br><br>It is important to note that, growing up in Detroit and its suburbs, I can honestly say it was never that good in the first place. People of older generations like to tell me about the swell old days of soda fountains and shopping stores and lazy Saturday night drives. But the fact is Detroit was dying forty years ago when the Japanese began to figure out how to make a better car. The whole country knew the city and the region was on the skids, and the whole country laughed at us. A bunch of lazy, uneducated blue-collar incompetents. The Rust Belt. The Rust Bowl. Forget about it. Florida was calling.<br><br>No one cared much about Detroit until the Dow collapsed in 2008, the economy melted down and the chief executives of the Big Three went to Washington, D.C., to grovel. Suddenly the eyes of the nation turned back upon this postindustrial sarcophagus, where crime and corruption and mismanagement and mayhem played themselves out in the corridors of power and on the powerless streets. Detroit became epic, historic, symbolic, hip even. I began to get calls from reporters around the world wondering what the city was like, what was happening here. They wondered if the Rust Belt cancer had metastasized and was creeping toward Los Angeles and London and Barcelona. Was Detroit an outlier or an epicenter? Was Detroit a symbol of the greater decay? Is the Motor City the future of America? Are we living through a cycle or an epoch? Suddenly they weren&#x2019;t laughing out there anymore.<br><br>Journalists parachuted into town. The subjects in my <i>Detroit News</i> stories started appearing in <i>Rolling Stone</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, on NPR and PBS and CNN, but under someone else&#x2019;s byline. The reporters rarely, if ever, offered nuanced appraisals of the city and its place in the American landscape. They simply took a tour of the ruins, ripped off the local headlines, pronounced it awful here and left.<br><br>And it is awful here, there is no other way to say it. But I believe that Detroit is America&#x2019;s city. It was the vanguard of our way up, just as it is the vanguard of our way down. And one hopes the vanguard of our way up again. Detroit is Pax Americana. The birthplace of mass production, the automobile, the cement road, the refrigerator, frozen peas, high- paid blue-collar jobs, home ownership and credit on a mass scale. America&#x2019;s way of life was built here.<br><br>It&#x2019;s where installment purchasing on a large scale was invented in 1919 by General Motors to sell their cars. It was called the Arsenal of Democracy in the 1940s, the place where the war machines were made to stop the march of fascism.<br><br>So important was the Detroit way of doing things that its automobile executives in the fifties and sixties went to Washington and imprinted the military with their management style and structure. Robert McNamara was the father of the Ford Falcon and the architect of the Vietnam War. Charlie Wilson was the president of General Motors and Eisenhower&#x2019;s man at the Pentagon, who famously said he thought that &#x201c;what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa.&#x201d;<br><br>If what Wilson said is true, then so too must be its opposite.<br><br>Today, the boomtown is bust. It is an eerie and angry place of deserted factories and homes and forgotten people. Detroit, which once led the nation in home ownership, is now a foreclosure capital. Its downtown is a museum of ghost skyscrapers. Trees and switchgrass and wild animals have come back to reclaim their rightful places. Coyotes are here. The pigeons have left in droves. A city the size of San Francisco and Manhattan could neatly fit into Detroit&#x2019;s vacant lots, I am told.<br><br>Once the nation&#x2019;s richest big city, Detroit is now its poorest. It is the country&#x2019;s illiteracy and dropout capital, where children must leave their books at school and bring toilet paper from home. It is the unemployment capital, where half the adult population does not work at a consistent job. There are firemen with no boots, cops with no cars, teachers with no pencils, city council members with telephones tapped by the FBI, and too many grandmothers with no tears left to give.<br><br>But Detroit can no longer be ignored, because what happened here is happening out there. Neighborhoods from Phoenix to Los Angeles to Miami are blighted with empty houses and people with idle hands. Americans are swimming in debt, and the prospects of servicing the debt grow slimmer by the day as good- paying jobs continue to evaporate or relocate to foreign lands. Economists talk about the inevitable turnaround. But standing here in Michigan, it seems to me that the fundamentals are no longer there to make the good life.<br><br>Go ahead and laugh at Detroit. Because you are laughing at yourself.<br><br>In cities and towns across the country, whole factories are auctioned off. Men with trucks haul away tool-and-die machines, aluminum siding, hoists, drinking fountains. It is the ripping out of the country&#x2019;s mechanical heart right before our eyes.<br><br>A newly hired autoworker will earn $14 an hour. This, adjusted for inflation, is three cents <i>less</i> than what Henry Ford was paying in 1914 when he announced the $5 day. And, of course, Ford isn&#x2019;t hiring.<br><br>Come to Detroit. Drive the empty, shattered boulevards, and the decrepitude of the place all rolls out in a numb, continuous fact. After enough hours staring into it, it starts to appear normal. Average. Everyday.<br><br>And then you come across something like a man frozen in ice and the skeleton of the anatomy of the place reveals itself to you.<br><br>The neck bone is connected to the billionaire who owns the crumbling building where the man died. The rib bones are connected to the countless minions shuffling through the frostbitten streets burning fires in empty warehouses to stay warm&#x2014; and get high. The hip bone is connected to a demoralized police force who couldn&#x2019;t give a shit about digging a dead mope out of an elevator shaft. The thigh bone is connected to the white suburbanites who turn their heads away from the calamity of Detroit, carrying on as though the human suffering were somebody else&#x2019;s problem. And the foot bones&#x2014;well, they&#x2019;re sticking out of a block of dirty frozen water, belonging to an unknown man nobody seemed to give a rip about.<br><br>We are not alone on this account. Across the country, the dead go unclaimed in the municipal morgues because people are too poor to bury their loved ones: Los Angeles, New York, Chicago. It&#x2019;s the same. Grandpa is on layaway while his family tries to scratch together a box and a plot.<br><br>This is not a book about geopolitics or macroeconomics or global finance. And it is not a feel- good story with a happy ending. It is a book of reportage. A memoir of a reporter returning home&#x2014; only he cannot find the home he once knew. This is a book about living people getting on with the business of surviving in a place that has little use for anyone anymore except those left here. It is about waking up one morning and being told you are obsolete and not wanting to believe it but knowing it&#x2019;s true. It is a book about a rough town and a tough people during arguably some of the most historic and cataclysmic years in the American experience. It is a book about family and cops and criminals and factory workers. It is about corrupt politicians and a collapsing newspaper. It is about angry people fighting and crying and snatching hold of one another trying to stay alive.<br><br>It is about the future of America and our desperate efforts to save ourselves from it.<br><br>At the end of the day, the Detroiter may be the most important American there is because no one knows better than he that we&#x2019;re all standing at the edge of the shaft.</p><h2>Visions of Health : Understanding Iridology</h2><p>For over one hundred years, researchers have studied the links between health and the patterns, colors, and textures of the iris.

The excitement of iridology stems from the thought that if tissue integrity throughout the body can be assessed by simply observing the color and structure of the iris, then a new and wonderful world of diagnostics and preventive medicine could thereby unfold before us. If this is so, why, you may ask, hasn&#x2019;t the science of iridology already made a smashing debut in the theatre of the healing arts? This book will tell you why. The science of iridology has been a sleeping giant. But of late, the giant has been stirring.</p><p>Iridology is controversial. Once you know what constitutes the science and practice of iris diagnosis, you will find it impossible to leave it alone. You will be compelled to investigate it in depth and then to either reject it or embrace it. You will find no middle ground. If iridology is true, it is nothing short of astounding, and the logical extensions of its philosophy will be enough to cause modern orthodox medicine to re-examine some of its most cherished principles. If false, it has to be the tragic product of misguided, albeit well-intentioned, people who mistakenly devoted the better part of their professional lives to its philosophy, practice, and promotion. But there is one thing iridology is not: it is not dull!</p><p>If you have eyes to see, iridology is for you. You don&#x2019;t have to be a health-care professional. You don&#x2019;t have to be a college graduate. And you don&#x2019;t have to be an expert to prove to yourself the validity and the benefits of reading the iris. The pages of this book will guide you step-by-step to the place where you, with no equipment other than a flashlight and simple magnifying glass, can examine your own eyes or the eyes of a friend and gain accurate and valuable information. How you utilize this information can be instrumental for you in attaining and maintaining health. You will learn how the eye is more than just &#x201c;the window of the soul.&#x201d; Iridology will lend new meaning to the phrase, &#x201c;the &#x2018;eyes&#x2019; have it!&#x201d; Let&#x2019;s not waste another moment. Enjoy!</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p><b>I</b>ris analysis is catching on. It&#x2019;s coming out of seclusion. A technique once known and practiced by only a few, iridology&#x2014;as it is called&#x2014;is being discovered by a greater number of people. Founded in the late nineteenth century in Hungary, iris analysis is now being studied in many countries of the world. Not long ago, Soviet officials announced that it is being taught in medically oriented institutions in the U.S.S.R. The Chinese recently translated modern iridology textbooks into their language. Iris analysis is in growing use in most of Europe, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, South America, Asia, and the United States.</p><p>Iridology is the art and science of analyzing the color and structure of the iris of the eye to gain valuable health information. &#x201c;Amazing&#x201d; and &#x201c;controversial&#x201d; are two words often associated with it. It is both. It is amazing to all who see its wonders but do not yet perceive its secrets. It is controversial because of its struggle for acceptance by contemporary medicine as a valid examination method.</p><p>The story of modern iris analysis is the story of its discoverers and pioneers. Studying iridology is learning its philosophy of health and disease. It is taking the time to explore its territory, learn its unique landmarks, and practice its principles.</p><p>Iris analysis does not stand alone. It is part of a larger family. Its close relatives are the numerous branches of the natural and drugless healing arts. Its marriage partner is the art and science of nutrition, to which it is joined for all time.</p><p>If you have ever wondered about the secrets the iris can reveal, come with me now and explore. In Part One of this book, I will introduce you to iris analysis&#x2014;its history, tools, language, and major signs. I will also explain, in layman&#x2019;s terms, how and why it works. In Part Two, I will help you put to use what you learned in Part One. Learn well, and enjoy the learning. You will not regret the time you put in, and you will use your new knowledge and skills forever.</p><p><b>Part One</b></p><p><b>Overview of Iridology</b></p><p></p><p><i>All cure starts from within out, from the head down, and in the reverse order as the symptoms appeared.</i></p><p>&#x2014;Hering&#x2019;s Law of Cure</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1.</b></p><p><b>The Big Picture</b></p><p><b>T</b>his story belongs to the eye. And we are going to let the eye tell it from its special point of view. The iris is a wonderful and colorful storyteller. By definition, the iris is that portion of the eye surrounding the pupil and giving the eye its distinctive color. It is the pigmentation of the iris that defines your baby blues or bashful browns. Since humans come equipped with a left and right iris, they possess one set of irides.</p><p>Iridology (i-rid-doll&#x2019;-o-jee) is &#x201c;the study of the iris, particularly of its color, markings, changes, etc., as associated with disease.&#x201d; This is according to the twenty-seventh edition of <i>Dorland&#x2019;s Illustrated Medical Dictionary.</i> The word &#x201c;iris,&#x201d; like so many words in medicine, stems from the Greek and means &#x201c;rainbow.&#x201d; Another translation is &#x201c;halo.&#x201d; The iris surrounds the pupil of the eye and might easily be thought of as a kind of halo encircling it. More descriptively, however, it is a rainbow because of its color or colors.</p><p>The iris is the most distinctively colored portion of the eye. It is what we see in our mind when we think of a beautiful eye color. Your iris is your personal rainbow. The precept of iridology is that valuable information concerning a person&#x2019;s health and well-being can be obtained by studying this rainbow. What irides reveal, and the fascinating way in which they relay the information, is the subject of this book.</p><p>It is very important to mention that information from the irides can be obtained quickly, painlessly, and inexpensively. That in itself ought to gain everyone&#x2019;s attention! Furthermore, a practitioner skilled in iris analysis can glean this information using nothing more than a simple, hand-held light source and a small magnifying lens. Expensive and complex equipment is not necessary to read an iris, although such apparatus is available for the serious, practicing iridologist and iridology researcher.</p><p>The practice of iridology is a covalent bond of science and art. Because iridology is practiced according to certain long-established and time-honored principles that constitute a rather well-defined and expanding body of knowledge, it rightly falls into the category of a science. At the same time, this fascinating science has some aspects of an art.</p><p>An iridologist must be able to exercise mental faculties that are not usually accessed through cold, scientific methodology. The iridologist&#x2019;s thinking must be broader. In keeping with the wholistic approach of iris analysis, the iridologist&#x2019;s attention must be focused on the person as much as on the person&#x2019;s complaints. Diseases can be dealt with scientifically; people are better dealt with artfully. Quality service to people seeks and employs the best of both dimensions, recognizing the unique value of each.</p><p>They say that there is nothing new under the sun. Maybe there isn&#x2019;t. But sometimes it takes a long time, even thousands of years, for people to <i>re</i>discover things. What they find may have been discovered before, but it surely is new to them. Such is the case with iridology. You may be surprised to learn that the idea of iridology, if not its practice, is nearly 2,000 years old, possibly even older. The idea is found in the Bible. Consider the verse in the sixth chapter of the book of St. Matthew. In verse twenty-two, we read, &#x201c;The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.&#x201d; The Old English of the King James Version can be modernized to read, &#x201c;The light of the body is the eye: so if your eye is pure, your whole body shall be full of light.&#x201d; Using iridology, we can see how the &#x201c;purity,&#x201d; or &#x201c;integrity,&#x201d; of the iris reflects the condition of tissues everywhere in the body.</p><p>You are now making your own discovery of iridology. For you, it is something new under the sun.</p><p><b>MEET DR. VON PECZELY AND REVEREND LILJEQUIST</b></p><p>Two European men who &#x201c;rediscovered&#x201d; the idea of iris analysis in the nineteenth century are generally considered today to share the title of &#x201c;father of iridology.&#x201d; The first of these men is Dr. Ignatz von Peczely. (See Figure 1.1.) His is a story that may seem rather curious. However, bear in mind that it is not in the least unusual for the pacesetters of any era to say or do things that may seem bizarre or strange to those of a less inquiring mind.</p><p>It is interesting to note that nearly all traditions have a mythology. Iridology is no exception. Please remember that myths are not akin to fairy tales or fabrications, as many people erroneously believe. Myths are stories usually preserved through oral tradition for quite some time before being put to paper. Thus, their origins are often obscure and they do not always reflect the ultimate in historical accuracy. Nevertheless, they are built around a kernel of truth. Such is the case, I believe, with the story of Ignatz von Peczely and the owl.</p><p>Tradition holds that in 1837, Von Peczely, as a lad of about ten years of age, captured an owl in the family garden in Hungary. In an effort to escape from its captor&#x2019;s hand, the owl fractured its leg. Von Peczely claimed to notice immediately a spot that developed in the owl&#x2019;s iris at the 6:00 (six o&#x2019;clock) position, which is to say the bottom part of the iris. We know from the iris chart (which we will discuss in Chapter 2) that this position corresponds to the leg. The iris mark made an impression on Von Peczely&#x2019;s young and inquisitive mind. Later in his life, Von Peczely noticed a similar marking in a man&#x2019;s iris. This sparked a remembrance of the encounter with the owl and brought the onset of the development of what is now modern iridology. Von Peczely went on to study medicine in Germany and later returned to his native Hungary to practice. He became quite well known as the doctor who could diagnose by looking into the eyes.</p><p>In recent years, it has been my privilege to meet and establish a friendship with Andre Peczely, who resides in San Mateo, California. When I met him, he had only an inkling of his Great Uncle Ignatz&#x2019;s work in iridology. He was surprised and pleased to learn of my work in this field and of the great esteem with which I hold his famous relative. Through his records and recollections of family life in Hungary, he has graciously provided me with much additional insight into the life of Dr. von Peczely. One of the unusual stories Andre Peczely told me was that Dr. von Peczely was an accomplished sculptor at the tender age of ten. Perhaps it was through this talent that he recognized something in the anatomical makeup of the eye that the average person usually misses.</p><p>The other father of iridology is Nils Liljequist, a Swedish clergyman who discovered iridology at about the same time as t...</p></p><h2>Kafka</h2><p>David Zane Mairowitz&#39;s brilliant text and the illustrations and comic panels of the world&#39;s greatest cartoonist, Robert Crumb (himself no stranger to self-loathing and alienation), help us to understand the essence of Kafka and provide insight beyond the clich� &#34;Kafkaesque,&#34; peering through Kafka&#39;s glass wall like no other book before it. The book is a wonderful educational tool for those unfamiliar with Kafka, including a brief but inclusive biography as well as the plots of many of his works, all illustrated by Crumb, making this newly designed edition a must-have for admirers of both Kafka and Crumb.</p><p>Born in Philadelphia, <strong>R. Crumb</strong> is the author of numerous comic works and one of the pioneers of underground comics and arguably one of the most famous cartoonists in history. His books include&nbsp;<em>The Book of Genesis Illustrated by R. Crumb</em>, and many more.

O unclad Mother." It is remarkable that prior to writing this first novel, Dan Simmons had spent only two and a half days in Calcutta, a city "too wicked to be suffered," his narrator says. Fortunately back in print after several years during which it was hard to obtain, this rich, bizarre novel practically reeks with atmosphere. The story concerns an American poet who travels with his Indian wife and their baby to Calcutta to pick up an epic poem cycle about the goddess Kali. The Bengali poet who wrote the poem cycle has disappeared under mysterious circumstances.<p>Horror critic Edward Bryant calls <i>Song of Kali</i> "an exactingly constructed, brutal, and uncompromising study of the degree to which an evil place may permeate and steep all that makes us human" and writes that it embodies "the stance of a psychologically violent novel about a violent society as a defensible and indisputably moral work of art." <i>Song of Kali</i> won a World Fantasy Award. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p><p><b>Dan Simmons</b> is a recipient of numerous major international awards, including the Hugo Award, World Fantasy Awards, Bram Stoker Awards, and the Shirley Jackson Award.

The bleak, eerie voice belongs to Francie Brady, the "pig boy," the only child of and alcoholic father and a mother driven mad by despair. Growing up in a soul-stifling Irish town, Francie is bright, love-starved, and unhinged, his speech filled with street talk, his heart filled with pain...his actions perfectly monstrous.<br><br>Held up for scorn by Mrs. Nugent, a paragon of middle-class values, and dropped by his best friend, Joe, in favor of her mamby-pamby son, Francie finally has a target for his rage--and a focus for his twisted, horrific plan.<br><br>Dark, haunting, often screamingly funny, <b>The Butcher Boy</b> chronicles the pig boy's ominous loss of innocence and chilling descent into madness. No writer since James Joyce has had such marvelous control of rhythm and language... and no novel since <b>The Silence Of The Lambs</b> has stunned us with such a macabre, dangerous mind.</p><p>"I was thinking how right ma was -- Mrs. Nugent all smiles when she met us and how are you getting on Mrs and young Francis are you both well? . . .what she was really saying was: <i>Ah hello Mrs Pig how are you and look Philip do you see what's coming now -- The Pig Family!</i>" <p> This is a precisely crafted, often lyrical, portrait of the descent into madness of a young killer in small-town Ireland.

Their distinctly female voices enrich their writings on the experience of the inner world, the nourishing role of friendship and community in our lives, and on finding our true work. </p><p> At its heart, <em> Enduring Grace</em> is a living testament to how we can make peace with sorrow and disappointment and bring joy and transcendence into our lives.</p></p><p>It's deeply and beautifully appropriate that this book by the author of the classic cookbook <i>Laurel's Kitchen</i> should begin with a quote from one of our greatest writers on food, M.F.K. Fisher. "It seems to me," Fisher writes, "that our three basic needs, for food and security and love, are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it...." So too with Carol Flinders. Her preface describes her own journey from the kitchen to this very personal series of reflections on these seven women mystics (Saint Clare of Assisi, Mechthild of Magdeburg, Julian of Norwich, Saint Catherine of Siena, Saint Catherine of Genoa, Saint Teresa of Avila, and Saint Therese of Lisieux), in each case giving us both an intimate and yet objective sense of the person and of her spirituality. Writing with grace, in a style that is both personal and informed (Flinders has a Ph.D. in comparative literature from Berkeley), Flinders brings to this project a scholar's authority along with a very large heart. The result is a real gift: a delightful introduction to these extraordinary women. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>Draws upon actual letters, teachings and sacred poetry of historical figures to portray how God can enter the life of anyone, and help create real divinity in flesh and blood form.</p><h2>Blood and Circuses (Phryne Fisher Mysteries, 6)</h2><p><p>Phryne Fisher is bored. Life appears to be too easy, too perfect. Her household is ordered, her love life is pleasant, the weather is fine. And then a man from her past arrives at the door. It is Alan Lee from the carnival. Alan and his friends want her to investigate strange happenings at Farrells Circus, where animals have been poisoned and ropes sabotaged. Mr. Christopher has been found with his throat cut in Mrs. Witherspoon's irreproachable boarding house and Miss Parkes, an ex-performer, is charged with his murder. Phryne must go undercover deeper than ever to solve the circus malaise. She must abandon her name, her title, her protection, her comfort, even her clothes. She must fall off a horse twice a day until she can stay on. She must sleep in a girls tent and dine on mutton stew. And she must find some allies. Meanwhile, in Melbourne, the young and fresh-faced policeman Tommy Harris has to solve his own mysteries with the help of the foul-spoken harridan Lizard Elsie, or Miss Parkes will certainly hang. Can Phyrne uncover the truth without losing her life?</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>Phryne Fisher, the Australian flapper-era bon vivant and amateur sleuth, is in a bit of a rut. Everything in her life, from her house to her man, is just the way it should be; and Fisher, who thrives on excitement and a certain amount of disorder, is quietly going nuts. So it's something of a relief, in a weird sort of way, when a group of people from the carnival show up at her door, asking her to investigate some strange goings-on--tortured animals, sabotaged props, and murder. Fisher decides there's only one way to solve the mystery: go undercover at the carnival. But when it sinks in that she has given up her own identity, and that she has no friends among the carnies, she begins to realize that she may have bitten off more than she can chew. But--as fans of this very popular series will expect--Phryne keeps her wits about her and her spirits up. A top-notch entry in this witty, hugely entertaining series. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

By tracing our various definitions of the self throughout history, Cushman reveals that psychotherapy is very much a product of a particular time and place&#x2014;and that it has been fundamentally complicit in creating many of the ills it seeks to assuage.</p><p><b>Philip Cushman, Ph.D.,</b> is associate professor at the California School of Professional Psychology, is also in private practice in Oakland, California.</p><h2>Taggart: A Novel</h2><p><p>Adam Stark had found gold.

Behind him was a ruthless bounty hunter--the deadliest lawman in the West. In front of him was a fortune in gold--and a pretty young woman hell-bent on carrying that fortune to safety. Suddenly Taggart was faced with a choice. He could either keep riding and leave the stubborn lady to fate and the Apaches. Or he could stay and help her make it out alive.

A year after earthquakes have devastated the Tennessee Valley, survivors are resisting demands by the federal government to relocate to FEMA refugee centers. United States National Guard units have proven ineffective at forcing these survivors out of the earthquake-damaged regions, due to their reluctance to employ deadly force against fellow Americans. As a result, the president has invited so-called foreign peacekeeping battalions to do the work of forcibly relocating the holdouts. The novel follows a small group of determined survivors in their resistance to the foreign enemies, and the American traitors who are their allies.</p><p>Matt Bracken was born in 1957 in Baltimore Maryland, and graduated from the University of Virginia in 1979 with a degree in Russian Studies. He was commissioned as a Naval officer, and served on east coast SEAL teams during the 1980s as a Special Warfare officer, including leading a SEAL detachment to Beruit Lebanon in 1983. He is also the author of &#34;Enemies Foreign And Domestic&#34; and &#34;Domestic Enemies: The Reconquista.&#34;The Enemies List: review of Foreign Enemies And Traitors by David Codrea GUNS Magazine, June 2010 I have a rule I tell every author who sends me a book to review: I only write good ones. If I don&#39;t care for it, I&#39;ll decline to say anything. I figure it&#39;s not my place to crush someone else&#39;s labor of love. So I ventured into Matthew Bracken&#39;s latest offering, Foreign Enemies and Traitors, with a bit of trepidation. After all, I&#39;d written reviews in this magazine for the two prior volumes in his trilogy, Enemies Foreign and Domestic (Nov. 2005) and Domestic Enemies: The Reconquista (Feb. 2007). I called the former a thrilling first novel, one that engages, grips and doesn&#39;t let up, and the latter a brave book [that] nails the probability of near-future disintegration of the Republic with terrifying prescience. And then there was Matt&#39;s handwritten note to me on the cover page of his latest: This is my best effort, it&#39;s all I can give. I hope it makes a difference. What if I didn&#39;t care for it? What if I was let down because it couldn&#39;t match the expectations the first two books instilled in me? No worries. This is the best of the bunch, and that&#39;s saying a lot. As always, Bracken writes a page-turner involving main characters you care about deeply or hate to their evil cores. This third volume is mainly Phil Carson&#39;s story, the Viet Nam veteran we met as a major supporting character in the first two novels. A hurricane has shipwrecked him in Mississippi while smuggling cargo from Central America into a vastly different country than the one he was born into. It&#39;s the Greater Depression. Following massive earthquakes, the Deep South is under the military rule of a general who is an authority unto himself. The federal government is hopelessly corrupt, presided over by a charismatic subversive who has placed fellow Marxist travelers in key positions of great power. The Northeast and Midwest reflect his socialist centralized federal control. Tennessee has been in rebellion, and the president, anxious to subdue the insurrection so he can turn his attention to the resource-rich Free States of the Northwest, has brought in foreign mercenaries. But it&#39;s not my place to tell you Matt&#39;s story. I want you to watch it unfold for yourself. It reads like a movie. Bracken paints scenes with a master&#39;s touch, so you can see where his characters are. You can feel their emotions. And when it comes to technical details, explanations of weapons systems, military protocols, intelligence capabilities--nobody does it better. Still, it&#39;s not an easy book. The details require us to pay attention. And there&#39;s much ugliness: the degradation of some, the racism, the evil (and tell me Bob Bullard, the soulless, ambitious Director of Rural Pacification doesn&#39;t qualify as a great villain!). If you haven&#39;t read the first two novels, don&#39;t let that stop you from getting this one. It reads well as a standalone book, and I can&#39;t think of a better introduction and inducement to discover the earlier works. You&#39;ve given enough, Mr. Bracken. Your best is superb.

It not only simplifies reading the text of the Greek New Testament but also gives the reader a wealth of tools that a lexicon and grammar alone cannot provide. For those with a basic knowledge of first-year Greek grammar and vocabulary, this completely revised and greatly expanded edition of the highly successful Linguistic Key to the Greek New Testament (1982) makes reading the Greek New Testament faster, easier, and more effective. Going through the New Testament verse by verse, The New Linguistic and Exegetical Key to the Greek New Testament provides help in three areas: Lexical - It identifies unusual and uncommon word forms that in the past had to be looked up in a lexicon, as well as their meaning, based on BAGD and other standard lexicons. Grammatical - It provides grammatical insights from the leading Greek grammars, including Wallace&#39;s Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics. Exegetical - As the title of this revised and expanded edition indicates, The New Linguistic and Exegetical Key to the Greek New Testament also provides the reader with a wealth of exegetical insights and nuances, as well as references to a wide range of commentaries, monographs, journal articles, historical works, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and so forth.</p><p>The original Linguistic Key to the Greek New Testament was first published 25 years ago in Germany. It was subsequently published in English, with additions and improvements. This revised and expanded edition broadens the scope of the earlier editions still further, to the extent that it stands now as a distinct, new work, fully geared toward English-speaking students. Building upon the content of the first English translation, The New Linguistic and Exegetical Key to the Greek New Testament goes beyond word forms to address grammatical and exegetical issues as well. It takes a proven study tool to the next level, equipping Greek students with a verse-by-verse analysis of unusual forms and grammatical and exegetical difficulties for the entire New Testament.Cleon L.

There, thanks to moderate climate, sheltering mountain ranges, lush forests, crystal-purewaterways teeming with wildlife, and the absence of predatory neighbors, the local tribes had prospered in their remote paradise for some 10,000 years.<br><br> All that suddenly ended in the middleof the nineteenth century when a proud, retired young U.S. Army major,an engineer with high political ambitions, was appointed the firstgovernor of newly acquired, 100,000-square-mile Washington Territory.Isaac Ingalls Stevens's primary task was to persuade the natives thattheir only hope for survival was to sign treaties handing over theirancestral lands to the American government in exchange for protectionfrom oncoming whites eager to turn the wilderness into crop-land. But one tribal chief at Puget Sound, Leschi of the Nisqually nation,insisted that his people be dealt with fairly and not coerced intosurrendering virtually their entire sacred homeland without justcompensation. <i>The Bitter Waters of Medicine Creek</i> is the emblematic story of this confrontation between the headstrongAmerican governor and the defiant leader of the Nisquallies and theirbrethren who resisted him and, in doing so, stirred up the gross abuseof power and the licensing of injustice on our last frontier.<br><br> Here is Richard Kluger's poignantrendering of the tragic relationship between the red and white races,told in graphic detail. Our social literature abounds with accounts ofhow racist degradation was visited on the far more numerous black andHispanic Americans. Yet the nation's self-righteous, methodicaldispossession of the Indians has been largely dismissed by whites as the sad but inevitable price of social and technological progress. Throughthe experience of a single tribe, <i>The Bitter Waters of Medicine Creek</i> seeks to clarify the historical record. It also tells, in a hopefulepilogue, the latest chapter of the Nisqually tribe's struggle to endure amid the mounting pressures of twenty-first-century modernity.</p><p><b>Richard Kluger</b> is the author of <i>Ashes to Ashes: America&#x2019;s Hundred-Year Cigarette War, the Public Health, and the Unabashed Triumph of Philip Morris</i>, which<i> </i>won the Pulitzer Prize.

The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Ike&#x2019;s Bluff </i>and<i> Sea of Thunder, </i>Thomas brings new life to one of American history&#x2019;s most infamous, paradoxical, and enigmatic politicians, dispensing with myths to achieve an intimate and nuanced look at the actual man.<br><br> What drove a painfully shy outcast in elite Washington society&#x2014;a man so self-conscious he refused to make eye contact during meetings&#x2014;to pursue power and public office? How did a president so attuned to the American political id that he won reelection in a historic landslide lack the self-awareness to recognize the gaping character flaws that would drive him from office and forever taint his legacy?<br><br> In <i>Being Nixon,</i> Evan Thomas peels away the layers of the complex, confounding figure who became America&#x2019;s thirty-seventh president. The son of devout Quakers, Richard Nixon (not unlike his rival John F. Kennedy) grew up in the shadow of an older, favored brother and thrived on conflict and opposition. Through high school and college, in the navy and in politics, he was constantly leading crusades and fighting off enemies real and imagined. As maudlin as he was Machiavellian, Nixon possessed the plainspoken eloquence to reduce American television audiences to tears with his career-saving &#x201c;Checkers&#x201d; speech; meanwhile, his darker half hatched schemes designed to take down his political foes, earning him the notorious nickname &#x201c;Tricky Dick.&#x201d; <br><br>Drawing on a wide range of historical accounts, Thomas reveals the contradictions of a leader whose vision and foresight led him to achieve d�tente with the Soviet Union and reestablish relations with communist China, but whose underhanded political tactics tainted his reputation long before the Watergate scandal. One of the principal architects of the modern Republican Party and its &#x201c;silent majority&#x201d; of disaffected whites and conservative ex-Dixiecrats, Nixon was also deemed a liberal in some quarters for his efforts to desegregate Southern schools, create the Environmental Protection Agency, and end the draft.<br><br> A deeply insightful character study as well as a brilliant political biography, <i>Being Nixon</i> offers a surprising look at a man capable of great bravery and extraordinary deviousness&#x2014;a balanced portrait of a president too often reduced to caricature.<br><br> <b>Praise for<i> Being Nixon</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A biography of eloquence and breadth . . .

The students wore togas and ate with their hands; the dry California hills passed for ancient Rome. Richard Nixon, the top student in the club, played Aeneas, Trojan hero and founder of Rome, and a girl named Ola Florence Welch played Dido, queen of Carthage.<br><br>Virgil&#x2019;s Aeneid imagines the ill-�fated romance of Aeneas and Dido. Dido is under the sway of Juno, who stands for domesticity and marital fidelity. Aeneas is ruled by Venus, goddess of passionate, sexual love. Dido beds Aeneas and regards herself as married. Aeneas, rather coldly, abandons Dido to fulfill his greater destiny. (&#x201c;To Italy I must go. There is the fatherland I must love.&#x201d;) Bereft, Dido throws herself on a funeral pyre, the gods&#x2019; reckoning for her hapless devotion.<br><br>It is doubtful that Nixon, age sixteen, was pondering the complexity of human nature and the vagaries of passion and commitment as he took the stage in the Whittier High gym. He had other worries. His feet hurt. It had taken both Latin teachers several minutes to tug the size-�9 silver boots over Nixon&#x2019;s size-�11 feet. &#x201c;The hour on stage in them was agony beyond belief and almost beyond endurance,&#x201d; Nixon recalled.<br><br>Worse, Nixon was supposed to take Dido in his arms, on stage, in public. He had never kissed a girl before, or even close&#x2014;�Whittier was an upright Quaker town and Nixon was bashful. When Aeneas in his toga and too-�small boots awkwardly reached out to embrace Dido, the student audience, heretofore bored, erupted in catcalls, hoots, and derisive laughter. Cheeks burning, the leading couple had to stop until the clamor died down.<br><br>Nixon later described the performance as &#x201c;an unbelievably horrendous experience.&#x201d; As the curtain fell to polite applause, the desperate-�to-�please high school junior volunteered to play the piano to entertain the disgruntled audience. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do anything to make the party a success,&#x201d; he told one of the Latin teachers. He was humiliated, however, and he lost his temper when one of the teachers criticized his clumsy performance.<br><br>Such a painful experience might have ended the thespian ambitions of any high school student (and Nixon did take away a lifelong aversion to wearing boots). But Nixon went on to act in several plays in college, with growing assurance and emotional range. Indeed, in 1952, when Nixon publicly wept after clearing his name from calumny with the so-�called Checkers Speech, his old acting coach, Albert Upton, exclaimed, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my boy! That&#x2019;s my actor!&#x201d;<br><br>Nixon&#x2019;s dramatic debut was a crisis, but for Richard Nixon, crisis was already normal&#x2014;�to be expected; endured; even, as time went on, welcomed. Defeat was what one overcame; rejection was to be reversed, if not avenged.<br><br>Two months before the Latin play, Nixon had been the choice of the Whittier High School faculty to become student body president. Nixon was responsible, dutiful, and attentive to his elders. But at the last moment, another boy, a popular athlete named Robert Logue, had entered as a surprise candidate and won the students&#x2019; votes. Nixon, who had been nicknamed &#x201c;Gloomy Gus&#x201d; by a few of the girls, had to settle for the position of &#x201c;administrator,&#x201d; appointed by the faculty. In photos in the Whittier High yearbook, the Cardinal and White, Logue looks like a tanned Adonis, with a confident smile, cleft chin, and swept-�back blond hair. In his photo, the dark-�haired Nixon looks young and anxious.<br><br>One of the girls who had voted for Bob Logue was Ola Florence Welch&#x2014;�Queen Dido. At the time of the election, she had written in her diary, &#x201c;Oh how I hate Richard Nixon.&#x201d; She had been mortified by her stage embrace with Nixon. &#x201c;We never practiced it. When we came to do it, it was very awkward and the kids went to pieces. I just about died,&#x201d; she recalled.<br><br>But when it was over, after briefly lashing out at his carping teacher, Nixon calmed down and grew purposeful. &#x201c;He never said a word about the play but he insisted that I must come over and meet his folks immediately,&#x201d; Ola Florence later recounted. Nixon wrote her a letter, apologizing for his &#x201c;caddish behavior&#x201d; (getting mad at the teacher) and explaining why, as he put it, he was &#x201c;so cracked up about you. . . . You are not a boy chaser. You use your brains to good purposes. You never show your anger to anyone. . . .&#x201d; He did not say anything about her looks, which, judging from photos, were striking, almost sultry.<br><br>Ola Florence reconsidered her opinion of Nixon. She decided that the dark-�haired, brooding boy was &#x201c;really quite handsome&#x201d; and that he was interesting, articulate, and unusual. They began going steady and remained a couple all through college. Indeed, while the romance was rocky, they would come close to marrying.<br><br>Aides to President Nixon like to reminisce and joke about Nixon&#x2019;s oft-�expressed dislike for Ivy Leaguers, particularly graduates of Harvard. In his memoir, H. R. Haldeman, Nixon&#x2019;s chief of staff, describes the president exclaiming, &#x201c;None of them in the Cabinet, do you understand? None of those Harvard bastards!&#x201d; Alexander Butterfield, a presidential assistant, recalled being summoned to the Oval Office after Nixon had somehow heard that the president of Harvard, Derek Bok, was on the White House premises. &#x201c;What is that son of a bitch doing here?&#x201d; Nixon demanded. Butterfield explained that Bok was a member of the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, and that Harvard had donated some paintings. &#x201c;Never again!&#x201d; cried Nixon. &#x201c;How did he get in here in the first place?&#x201d; John Ehrlichman, another top Nixon aide, recalled that &#x201c;Nixon used to talk about the Eastern Establishment, but a lot of good people came from Harvard and similar places. He took them on, muttering and chirping all the time, about how deplorable it was, but he took them on and confided in them.&#x201d; Indeed, Theodore White noted that Nixon hired far more Harvard men than all the Harvard men who had been president (the two Adamses, the two Roosevelts, and Kennedy). Nixon chose as his foreign policy adviser a Harvard grad and Harvard professor, Henry Kissinger, and an equally intimidating Harvard professor, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, as his first domestic policy adviser. This was ironic but actually not surprising. Nixon was smarter, more intellectual, more open to ideas than almost any president who had come before him, including the ones who had gone to Harvard.<br><br>At graduation from Whittier High in June 1930, Nixon won the Harvard Club of California&#x2019;s award for outstanding all-�around student, &#x201c;which will probably irritate many of my friends who did go to Harvard,&#x201d; Nixon recalled a half-�century later. The award entitled Nixon to apply for a tuition scholarship from Harvard (he received a similar offer from Yale). But Nixon had to stay home. It was the Depression, and there was no money for travel or living expenses.<br><br>Nixon was not poor, exactly, but his family was cash-�strapped. Frank, his blustery, bullying father, was a rolling stone who had worked a number of low-�paying jobs, including as a trolley car conductor, factory hand, and oil roustabout. His mother Hannah, born to more genteel circumstances, endured lean times with a kind of tense grace. Frank would loudly denounce his bad luck and all who caused it; Hannah would smile sweetly, if a bit grimly, and keep her resentments bottled up.<br><br>Frank had planted some failing lemon groves in the thin soil of Yorba Linda in 1913, the year Nixon was born. The tiny town to the east of Los Angeles smelled sweetly of orange blossoms in the spring, but in the fall, when the Santa Ana&#x2014;�the fierce wind the Indians called &#x201c;Devil&#x2019;s Breath&#x201d;&#x2014;�blew in off the desert, young Nixon could hear rocks bouncing off the side of the little bungalow his father had built. The dust seeped in everywhere. On many nights, Hannah had to serve a dinner of fried mush.<br><br>Frank Nixon gave up the citrus groves and started up a gas station and grocery store on the road at the edge of Whittier, a nearby college town nestled amid eucalyptus and palm trees on a steep hillside. In the boom-�and-�bust of California&#x2019;s Southland of the 1920s, the gas station prospered. There had been enough money to send Richard&#x2019;s older brother, Harold, back east to Mount Hermon, a Christian boarding school in Massachusetts.<br><br>Harold Nixon was tall, blond, and handsome. The girls &#x201c;swooned over him,&#x201d; Richard recalled. Harold was fun-�loving and mischievous, outgoing and popular. He was a hellraiser and a cut-�up. Richard, as a little boy, was the opposite. He was solemn and fastidious and preferred his own company. His cousin Jessamyn West observed that &#x201c;he didn&#x2019;t seem to want to be hugged.&#x201d; He dressed in starched white shirts, and he carried his shoes in a bag when he went barefoot. He complained to his mother that other boys on the school bus smelled. &#x201c;He was very fussy, always neat,&#x201d; his mother Hannah recalled. &#x201c;He seemed to carry quite a little weight for a boy of his age.&#x201d;<br><br>If there is a lasting impression of Richard Nixon as a boy, it is one of solitariness. Friends and relatives remember him lying by himself in the grass, staring up at the sky, or wandering past the clusters of playing boys, lost in his own thoughts. He was a stickler for order. His uncle recalled that when the Nixon cousins were playing with a football, young Richard, age eight or so, took away the ball and sat by himself on the porch, insisting that he would give it back only when the others played by the rules. The sad-�faced boy with the unruly shock of black hair seemed to yearn for order and certainty.<br><br>Young Richard was a dreamer. He recalled listening to train whistles in the night, and when, on his thirteenth birthday, his grandmother Almira Milhous gave him a portrait of Lincoln, he hung it over his bed, along with a copy of Longfellow&#x2019;s Psalm of Life, written out in his grandmother&#x2019;s hand:<br><br>Lives of great men oft remind us<br><br>We can make our lives sublime<br><br>And departing leave behind us<br><br>Footprints in the sands of time.<br><br>It was a heavy burden for an impressionable boy. And yet Nixon had a slight subversive streak. As a boy as well as a man, Nixon could be painfully ill at ease, and his jokes sometimes fell flat. He would never be mistaken for a wit. But he did possess a mordant, dry hint of humor, even as a thirteen-�year-�old. In history class a few weeks after Grandmother Milhous set up Lincoln as a role model with Longfellow&#x2019;s poem, Nixon penned a parody&#x2014;�not a knee-�slapper, but a looser, more puckish try than might be expected from such a solemn, eager-�to-�please boy:<br><br>Now the lives of great men all remind us<br><br>We can make our lives that sort<br><br>And departing, leave behind us<br><br>Footprints on the tennis court.<br><br>Hardship, familiar to the Nixon household, became tragedy in 1925, the year Richard turned twelve. Arthur, the fourth son, died of a mysterious illness. In his memoirs, Nixon wrote that he cried every day for weeks. Nixon&#x2019;s mother, Hannah, recalled him just sitting and staring into space, silent and dry-�eyed. A couple of years later, Harold, too, became sick. Nixon knew something was wrong as soon as the family picked up the oldest boy up at the train station after his first year in Massachusetts. Harold was coughing and feverish. He had tuberculosis, a dangerous, frequently fatal disease.<br><br>Frank Nixon refused to take handouts, so he passed up the county hospital where &#x201c;lungers,&#x201d; as TB victims were sometimes called, could get free care, opting instead to pay for an expensive private sanatorium. When the money ran out, Hannah Nixon took her sick eldest son into the dry mountains of Prescott, Arizona, and set up a boarding house for Harold and a couple of other TB patients. Richard and his younger brother Donald were left at home in Whittier to fend with their father. It was a life of constant work, some of it drudgery. From the time he was fifteen or so, Richard arose every morning at four o&#x2019;clock to drive into the vegetable markets in Los Angeles to buy fresh produce for the family grocery store before heading off to school. In the summer, Nixon joined his mother in Arizona, where he did odd jobs (including as a carnival barker) while his mother changed bedpans and cleaned basins of bloody sputum.<br><br>Nixon referred to his mother as a &#x201c;saint.&#x201d; She spoke in a gentle voice but refrained from hugging or using expressions of endearment. True to her Quaker faith, she looked to an &#x201c;inner light&#x201d; and disliked showy religion. She said her evening prayers in a closet. Nixon feared his father&#x2019;s temper, but he was more frightened of his mother&#x2019;s &#x201c;look.&#x201d; Hannah had an &#x201c;iron hand inside her velvet glove,&#x201d; recalled Nixon&#x2019;s girlfriend, Ola Florence Welch. Hannah could punish just by her silence.<br><br>Nixon followed his mother&#x2019;s example of trying not to antagonize Frank Nixon. When his father grew belligerent, Richard would hide with a book. Near the Nixon bungalow was an irrigation ditch that was quite dangerous to small children. Hannah&#x2019;s sister, Elizabeth Milhous Harrison, recalled watching in horror as Frank grabbed his boys out of the irrigation ditch where they had been playing and then threw them back in again, yelling, &#x201c;If you want water, I&#x2019;ll give you enough.&#x201d; Their aunt cried out, &#x201c;Frank, you&#x2019;ll kill them, you&#x2019;ll kill them!&#x201d;<br><br>Hannah&#x2019;s family disapproved of Frank, who had never graduated from elementary school and was semi-�literate. Her sisters warned her not to stoop. The day Hannah and Frank were married, her little sister carved on a cherry tree, &#x201c;Hannah is a bad girl.&#x201d; The Milhous family was haughty, recalled Jessamyn West, and held itself above everyone but the other proper Quaker families who lived in Victorian houses on and around Whittier Hill. Nixon may have first felt the sting of snobbery within his own family.<br><br>Nixon was caught between his two parents, trying to please both. He sought love from one, then the other; one wonders if he ever really found it from either. &#x201c;Can you imagine,&#x201d; asked Henry Kissinger, &#x201c;what this man would have been like if somebody had loved him?&#x201d; Kissinger was exaggerating for effect, but Nixon&#x2019;s insecurities seem so profound that he must, as a child, have lacked for some essential assurance. Self-�protection, more than nurturing, seems to have been the order of the day in the Nixon household. Young Richard learned to avoid his father&#x2019;s temper and his hand. (As small boys, Richard and his brothers were not spanked but &#x201c;thumped,&#x201d; rapped on the head.) Richard watched as his mother intercepted customers in the store before Frank could bombard them with his vehemently held political views. If she didn&#x2019;t get there in time, she sometimes followed the browbeaten customers out the door, trying to soothe them. In his memoirs, Nixon was still abashed by the shouting matches between his father and his brothers that could be heard &#x201c;all across the neighborhood.&#x201d; In a rare instance of self-�reflection, Nixon wrote, &#x201c;Perhaps my own aversion to personal confrontations dates back to these early recollections.&#x201d;</p><h2>Owly, Vol. 2: Just A Little Blue</h2><p>The second graphic novel in the breakout, all-ages series, Owly. Owly is a kind, yet lonely, little owl who&#39;s always on the search for new friends and adventure. Relying on a mixture of symbols, icons, and expressions to tell his silent stories, Runton&#39;s clean, animated, and heartwarming style makes it a perfect read. Owly learns that sometimes you have to make sacrifices and work at things that are important, especially friendship.</p><p>Gr. 3--5. In this nearly wordless graphic-novel companion to <i>Owly: The Way Home &amp; The Bittersweet Summer</i> (2004), best friends Owly and Wormy meet a stubborn bluebird that lives with its family in an old tree stump. After learning that the birds' habitat is in danger, the friends decide to build their surly neighbor a new home. However, Blue turns his nose up at offers of a new house, even threatening Wormy, so the compassionate owl and worm give up and pack the little home they made into the closet. Later, when the seasonal rains endanger Blue and his family, Owly and a worried Wormy come to the rescue. The humanity and sweetness of the first book are replicated here, as is the deceptively simple line work, which conveys the story with a flair and subtlety that makes words unnecessary.

Two boys, one an urchin from London's filthy lanes, the other a prince born in a lavish palace, unwittingly trade identities. Thus a bedraggled "Prince of Poverty" discovers that his private dreams have all the come true -- while a pampered Prince of Wales finds himself tossed into a rough-and-tumble world of squalid beggars and villainous thieves. Originally written as a story for children, <i>The Prince And The Pauper</i> is a classic novel for adults as well -- through its stinging attack on the ageless human folly of attempting to measure true worth by outer appearances.This treasured historical satire, played out in two very different socioeconomic worlds of 16th-century England, centers around the lives of two boys born in London on the same day: Edward, Prince of Wales, and Tom Canty, a street beggar.

Written by prize-winning historian Craig L. Symonds, Lincoln and His Admirals unveils an aspect of Lincoln's presidency unexamined by historians until now, revealing how he managed the men who ran the naval side of the Civil War, and how the activities of the Union Navy ultimately affected the course of history. <p>Beginning with a gripping account of the attempt to re-supply Fort Sumter--a comedy of errors that shows all too clearly the fledgling president's inexperience--Symonds traces Lincoln's steady growth as a wartime commander-in-chief. Absent a Secretary of Defense, he would eventually become de facto commander of joint operations along the coast and on the rivers. That involved dealing with the men who ran the Navy: the loyal but often cranky Navy Secretary Gideon Welles, the quiet and reliable David G. Farragut, the flamboyant and unpredictable Charles Wilkes, the ambitious ordnance expert John Dahlgren, the well-connected Samuel Phillips Lee, and the self-promoting and gregarious David Dixon Porter. Lincoln was remarkably patient; he often postponed critical decisions until the momentum of events made the consequences of those decisions evident. But Symonds also shows that Lincoln could act decisively. Disappointed by the lethargy of his senior naval officers on the scene, he stepped in and personally directed an amphibious assault on the Virginia coast, a successful operation that led to the capture of Norfolk. The man who knew "little about ships" had transformed himself into one of the greatest naval strategists of his age. A unique and riveting portrait of Lincoln and the admirals under his command, this book offers an illuminating account of Lincoln and the nation at war. In the bicentennial year of Lincoln's birth, it offers a memorable portrait of a side of his presidency often overlooked by historians.</p></p><p>In the conversation below, two noted Lincoln historians, Craig L. Symonds and James M. McPherson (Pulitzer-Prize winning author of <i>Abraham Lincoln</i>) discuss the often-neglected role of the Union Navy in the Civil War. The discussion centers on the introduction of a new kind of warship with iron sides and revolving gun turrets called the <i>U.S.S. Monitor</i>, designed by engineer John Ericsson. Ironclads, or monitors as they were called, were used in the Union blockade of Southern ports. Though both Lincoln and Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles embraced the new ships, Admiral Samuel Du Pont did not. DuPont's failed attack on Charleston not only brought and end to his career but also earned him derision for his failure to adapt to new technology. Both authors share the prestigious 2009 Lincoln Prize for the year&#x2019;s best books on Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War. McPherson&#x2019;s <i>Tried by War: Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief</i> and Symonds's <i>Lincoln and His Admirals</i> were the winning books.<br><br> <p><strong>A Conversation Between Two Lincoln Historians: James M. McPherson and Craig L. Symonds</strong></p> <p> </p><p><b>McPherson:</b> We know from [the diary of] John Hay that Lincoln put himself through a cram course of readings in military history and strategy during the fall and winter of 1861-62, mainly so he could deal more intelligently and forcefully with such generals as McClellan, Halleck, and Buell. Did Lincoln do anything comparable to overcome his admission that he knew "little about ships"?</p> <p><b>Symonds:</b> Not really. A lifelong autodidact, Lincoln focused on learning as much as he could about war in the first months of the conflict, but he saw from the beginning that the land war was far more important than the naval war. While he read all that he could about the theories of war, he did not undertake a similar regimen concerning naval strategy, in part because there were fewer such books. He was fascinated by new weaponry, played a role in getting the Navy to adopt Ericsson's <i>Monitor</i>, and he consulted both Seward and Bates on the legality of the blockade, but for the most part, he relied on Gideon Welles, and especially the Assistant Navy Secretary, Gustavus Fox, to provide him with whatever professional knowledge or technical information he needed.</p> <p><b>McPherson:</b> Historians hold a wide range of opinions about the effectiveness of the blockade and how important a role it played in ultimate Union victory. Where do you stand on this question?</p> <p><b>Symonds:</b> I guess it depends on whether the glass is half full or half empty. The blockade was never impervious, and at times seemed quite porous. As many have argued, the South was able to import through the blockade the weapons and supplies it needed to sustain its armies in the field for four years, though it did encounter serious shortages in specific areas such as steam engines, engine parts, and railroad rails. Exports were a different story. Cotton exports plunged from 2.8 million bales in the last year of peace to only 55,000 bales in the first year of war. That undercut the Confederacy's ability to establish credit overseas, contributed to inflation and civilian unrest at home, and generally undermined the Confederate economy. The loss of southern revenue from cotton exports was greater than the amount the North spent to establish and maintain the blockade. Given that, I think the blockade was worth the investment. If it succeeded in shortening the war by, say, six month, it probably saved many thousands of lives.</p> <p><b>McPherson:</b> Along with Gideon Welles and Gustavus Fox, Lincoln was critical of Samuel Francis Du Pont for lack of aggressiveness and pertinacity in the failed attack on the defenses of Charleston on April 7, 1863, and compared Du Pont to McClellan. Was this fair? </p><p><b>Symonds:</b> There are many things in war that are not fair. Du Pont was very likely correct in asserting that Charleston could not be taken by a purely naval attack, as Gideon Welles repeatedly encouraged him to do, and he was effectively fired for demonstrating that his view was correct. [Historian] Kevin Weddle calls Du Pont "Lincoln's Tragic Admiral," a victim of Welles' determination to protect the reputation of his beloved monitors. But Du Pont's fall from grace was due not merely to his failure to capture Charleston. It was also due to two other factors: one was that Lincoln had become scarred by his lengthy and frustrating relationship with McClellan during the 1862 campaign, and by 1863 he had began to view Du Pont through a prism defined by that experience. When Du Pont called for reinforcements, or bemoaned the obstacles in front of him, it was McClellans' voice that Lincoln heard. The other reason for Du Pont's fall is that he never fully explained to the President precisely why he objected to a navy-only attack. Instead he only hinted at it by detailing how strong the enemy defenses were and how limited his own forces were. He never clearly laid out an alternative with the kind of strong advocacy that showed his willingness to carry it out. Even then, I think Lincoln would have stood by Du Pont but for Du Pont's own foolish behavior when he insisted that the government must publish his official reports (including compromising information about the vulnerabilities of the monitors) in order to counter hostile newspaper articles about him. In the end, Du Pont's reticence and touchiness were responsible for his tragedy.</p> <p><b>McPherson:</b> Did Lincoln show unjustified favoritism toward John A. Dahlgren when he promoted him to Rear Admiral and gave him command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron even though Dahlgren had limited experience in seagoing command? </p><p><b>Symonds:</b> Dahlgren was unquestionably Lincoln's favorite admiral. He much appreciated Farragut's success, but he liked Dahlgren, often went to the Washington Navy Yard to visit with him, and eventually he asked Welles to promote him to admiral, even though Dahlgren had virtually no important sea service. Most of the navy looked upon Lincoln's decision to promote his friend from commander to Rear Admiral in one step as personal favoritism. It was favoritism, but whether it was unjustified depends on how well Dahlgren performed in command. Though Charleston never fell, Dahlgren was an active and effective commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and despite suffering poor health that might have ended the career of a less determined man, Dahlgren worked hard and earned the confidence of his officers throughout the long and wasting siege.</p> <p><b>McPherson:</b> From 1862 on, Acting Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee wanted to attack the defenses of Wilmington to shut down the port to blockade runners. When the time came in 1864 to carry out the attack, however, Welles, Fox, and Grant convinced Lincoln that Lee was not the man to command it, and replaced him with Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter. Was this treatment of Lee justified?</p> <p><b>Symonds:</b> Like Du Pont, Phillips Lee was a competent officer who was at his best managing the multivariate activities of a far-flung squadron. Unlike Du Pont, he never had the chance to prove himself in a major battle and thereby win promotion to the permanent rank of Rear Admiral. Because the authorizing legislation stipulated that promotions to admiral must be won in battle, Lee repeatedly asked Welles for permission to attack Wilmington, North Carolina. Not until 1864 did Welles accede, and when he did he sent Lee off to the backwater of the Mississippi Squadron and brought in the brash David Dixon Porter to carry it out. Lee felt himself a victim of Welles' favoritism for others. But in this case, it was U. S. Grant as much as Gideon Welles who was responsible. In Grant's view, Lee had not been sufficiently aggressive during the move up the James River, and he wanted someone else to command of the attack on Wilmington. When Farragut declined the command, Welles gave it to Porter. Lee's anger at this treatment is understandable, but Welles and Grant had concluded that while Lee was an effective manager, he was not the man for a full-scale attack. In the end, Lee never did get a chance to prove himself in the kind of engagement that might have won him the promotion he sought. Read more</p><br><strong>Craig L.

The replacement minister looks like Christ. He even heals the sick and performs miracles. Could this messenger of hope and renewal be the real thing?<p>At first, this small town is abuzz with reports of miracles and religious sightings (a weeping statue of Christ, a disappearing hitchhiker warning of Christ's arrival, a soothing angel). But suddenly there's a twist of evil and demonic mystery in the air. It's up to the jaded minister Travis to track down the real story behind this visitor and somehow find a way to stop him.</p><p> Frank Peretti has been a hit sensation in the Christian thriller market but admits that up until now his books have surfed in the shallow waters of pop fiction. In <i>The Visitation</i>, Peretti has worked his craft more carefully--exploring how suffering leads to disillusionment in God as well as deepening his characterization. (The main character is a thinly disguised reflection of Peretti's own bout with doubt.) Fans will be relieved to know that Peretti is still dedicated to suspenseful drama, and there's still plenty of spine-chilling mayhem when all hell literally breaks loose on this small-town cast of characters.</p>"<i>The Visitation</i> is about a crisis of faith, and one man's coming of age as a believer in Jesus. It is fiction, but honest. It is a searching of my own heart and a sharing of what I found with my readers. As such it is the most difficult book I have ever written. I hope you enjoy it."</p><h2>The Stupidest Angel: A Heartwarming Tale of Christmas Terror</h2><p><p>Christmas crept into Pine Cove like a creeping Christmas thing: dragging garland, ribbon, and sleigh bells, oozing eggnog, reeking of pine, and threatening festive doom like a cold sore under the mistletoe.</p><p>'Twas the night (okay, more like the week) before Christmas, and all through the tiny community of Pine Cove, California, people are busy buying, wrapping, packing, and generally getting into the holiday spirit. It is the hap-hap-happiest time of the year, after all.</p><p>But not everybody is feeling the joy. Little Joshua Barker is in desperate need of a holiday miracle. No, he's not on his deathbed; no, his dog hasn't run away from home. But Josh is sure that he saw Santa take a shovel to the head, and now the seven-year-old has only one prayer: Please, Santa, come back from the dead.</p><p>But hold on! There's an angel waiting in the wings. (Wings, get it?) It's none other than the Archangel Raziel come to Earth seeking a small child with a wish that needs granting. Unfortunately, our angel's not sporting the brightest halo in the bunch, and before you can say "Kris Kringle," he's botched his sacred mission and sent the residents of Pine Cove headlong into Christmas chaos, culminating in the most hilarious and horrifying holiday party the town has ever seen.</p><p>Only Christopher Moore, the man who brought you the outrageous lost gospel <em>Lamb</em> and the hysterical fish tale <em>Fluke</em> could have devised a new holiday classic that tugs at the heartstrings and serves up a healthy slice of fruitcake to boot.</p><p>Move over, Charles Dickens -- it's Christopher Moore time.</p></p><p><p>Christopher Moore is the author of fourteen previous novels, including <em>Lamb, The Stupidest Angel, Fool, Sacr� Bleu, A Dirty Job,</em> and <em>The Serpent of Venice.</em></p>Tony Roberts throws himself into the "spirit of the season" with relish and pizzazz as he reads Moore's absurd story about the residents of Pine Cove, California. Roberts is dripping with enthusiasm--and his voice is rich with the ironic humor Moore uses so generously--in telling the story of a dead Santa, a foolish archangel, a stoned cop and his crazy wife, a child's wish, and a town full of zombies. Roberts's careful rendering of each character hits the mark, bringing each person--living or dead--to life. A great match for Moore's dry wit and outlandish understatement, Roberts possesses a gift for the timing needed to pull off this wildly funny tale.

But peer orientation undermines family cohesion, poisons the school atmosphere, and fosters an aggressively hostile and sexualized youth culture. It provides a powerful explanation for schoolyard bullying and youth violence; its effects are painfully evident in the context of teenage gangs and criminal activity, in tragedies such as in Littleton, Colorado; Tabor, Alberta and Victoria, B.C. It is an escalating trend that has never been adequately described or contested until Hold On to Your Kids. Once understood, it becomes self-evident -- as do the solutions. <br>Hold On to Your Kids will restore parenting to its natural intuitive basis and the parent-child relationship to its rightful preeminence. The concepts, principles and practical advice contained in Hold On to Your Kids will empower parents to satisfy their children's inborn need to find direction by turning towards a source of authority, contact and warmth. <p>"Something has changed. One can sense it, one can feel it, just not find the words for it. Children are not quite the same as we remember being. They seem less likely to take their cues from adults, less inclined to please those in charge, less afraid of getting into trouble.Parenting, too, seems to have changed. Our parents seemed more confident, more certain of themselves and had more impact on us, for better or for worse. For many, parenting does not feel natural. Adults through the ages have complained about children being less respectful of their elders and more difficult to manage than preceding generations, but could it be that this time it is for real? -- from Hold On to Your Kids </p><p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p><b>Gordon Neufeld, Ph.D</b>, is a clinical psychologist in private practice in Vancouver.

He could not believe his eyes; in this forbidding part of the world, human habitation was a statistical impossibility. A team of scientists parachuted in and were stunned by what they found: a primitive wood cabin, and a family dressed in rags that spoke, thought, and lived in the manner of seventeenth-century Russian peasants during the reign of Tsar Peter the Great. How they come here, how they survived, and how they ultimately prevailed in a climate of unimaginable adversity make for one of the most extraordinary human adventures of this century.<br>Acclaimed Pravda journalist Vasily Peskov has visited this family once a year for the past twelve years, gaining their trust and learning their story. It begins in the late seventeenth century, when a community of Russian Orthodox fundamentalists made a two-thousand-mile odyssey from the Ukraine to the depths of the Siberian taiga to escape religious persecution at the hands of Peter the Great, who sought to reform the Russian Orthodox Church. For nearly 250 years, this band of "Old Believers" kept the outside world at bay, but in the 1930s Stalin's brutal collectivization program swept East and threw them from their land. But the young family of Karp Osipovich Lykov refused to abandon the only way of life they knew, and fled even deeper into the desolate Siberian hinterland. By the time Peskov came to know them, they had been alone for more than fifty years, surviving solely on what they could harvest, hunt, and build by their own means. The sole surviving family member, the daughter Agafia, lives by herself in the Lykov family cabin to this day.<br>In Lost in the Taiga, Peskov brings to life the Lykovs' faith, their doubt, and their epic struggle against an unyielding wilderness, even as he pays homage to a natural habitat that is being despoiled so rapidly it may soon no longer exist. Peskov's account has captured the imagination of the world: published in ten countries on three continents, it is being made into a movie by internationally acclaimed filmmaker Jean-Jacques Annaud. Lost in the Taiga is a lyrical celebration of the Siberian taiga's savage beauty, and a moving testament to the power of the human will.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: RussianPeskov, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda, tells the story of a Russian religious dissident who, in 1932, took his wife into the remote Siberian Taiga and remained there, effectively frozen in time, until the 1990s. In 1978, while flying over the upper reaches of the Abakan River, a group of geologists spot what looks like a garden in the midst of the wilderness. On landing, they find not only a garden but paths, a house, and--looking like a vision from the previous century--an old man dressed in patched sacking, speaking a strange dialect. The man, Karp Lykov, and his family are members of a fundamentalist sect called the Old Believers, who insist that they are not permitted to ``live with the world.'' The men and women live separately in this tiny primitive colony. We see daughter Agafia climb nimbly up pine trees to knock off the nuts for her father; we see the pitch dark house with no lighting. Later, as the Lykovs become slowly acquainted with the surrounding Russian society, we see their first reactions to horses, modern buildings, trains, and a boxing match, which so horrifies Agafia that she flees from it. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this saga is the Old Believers' system of counting time, which they reckon as did people before the time of Peter the Great: by the Psalter and the lunar phases. Given the resistance to modernity among religious fanatics, and given Russia's troubled encounter with modernity and the vastness of the land, Peskov writes, ``it is not hard to imagine many similar retreats cropping up...The taiga has swallowed up many small monasteries, poor huts and grave crosses.'' At the end of his brisk and informative account, Peskov wonders if the Lykovs--who missed the purges, WW II, and all the shake-ups that followed--were happy with their life in the wilderness. ``I think so,'' he concludes. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Eating Well for Optimum Health . . . The Healthy Kitchen</i>&#x2013;in each of his widely acclaimed, best-selling books, Dr. Andrew Weil has been an authoritative and companionable guide through a uniquely effective combination of traditional and nontraditional approaches to health and healthy living. Now he gives us a book about aging that is unlike any other in the breadth and depth of its information and understanding. Hugely informative, practical, and uplifting, it is infused with the engaging candor and common sense that have been the hallmarks of all his books.<br><br>At the heart of <i>Healthy Aging</i> is Dr. Weil&#x2019;s belief that although aging is an irreversible process, there are myriad things we can do to keep our minds and bodies in good working order through all phases of life. To that end, he draws on the new science of biogerentology (the biology of aging) as well as on the secrets of healthy longevity&#x2013; diet, activity, and attitude&#x2013;that he has gathered firsthand from cultures around the world. <br>In Part One&#x2013;&#x201c;The Science and Philosophy of Healthy Aging&#x201d;&#x2013;he explains how the body ages, and he explores the impact of gender, genes, environment, and lifestyle on an individual&#x2019;s experience and perception of the process of aging. He describes the various would-be elixirs of life extension&#x2013;herbs, hormones, and antiaging &#x201c;medicines&#x201d;&#x2013;separating myth from fact and clearly delineating the difference between the spurious notions of preventing or reversing the process of aging and the real possibilities of inhibiting or delaying the onset of diseases that become more likely as we age. He writes movingly about the ways in which an acceptance of aging can be a significant part of doing it well, and of recognizing and appreciating the great rewards of growing older: depth and richness of experience, complexity of being, serenity, wisdom, and its own kind of power and grace. <br><br>In Part Two&#x2013;&#x201c;How to Age Gracefully&#x201d;&#x2013;Weil details an easy-to-implement Anti-inflammatory Diet that will protect the immune system and aid your body in resisting and adapting to the changes that time brings. And he provides extensive practical advice on exercise; preventive health care; stress management; physical, mental, and emotional flexibility; and spiritual enhancement&#x2013;all of which can help you achieve and maintain the best health throughout the lifelong process of aging.<br><br><i>Healthy Aging</i>&#x2013;a book for people of <i>all</i> ages&#x2013;is Andrew Weil&#x2019;s most important and far-reaching book yet.</p><p>Dr. Weil has raised dispensing health advice to an art form. Instead of making his audience feel inadequate or guilty about bad habits, he seems to subconsciously convince readers to do better merely by presenting health facts in a non-threatening way. <i>Healthy Aging</i> is his most scientifically technical book yet (you'll learn all about enzymes like telomerase and cell division and the chemistry behind phytonutrients like indole-3-carbinol, and the connection between cancer and other degenerative diseases like diabetes) yet by far his most fascinating. <br> <br> His main mission here is to recommend "aging gracefully," which he considers accepting the process instead of fighting it. As the director of the country's leading integrative-medicine clinic (combining the best of traditional and alternative worlds), of course he disses Botox and the slew of $100-a-jar face creams out there. It's also no surprise that he focuses on proper nutrition, moderate exercise, and meditation and rest among his "12-point program for healthy aging." (Triathletes and exercise addicts should take special note of the research linking excessive exercise and ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.) He occasionally references his earlier works, including <i>8 Weeks to Optimum Health</i>. But the most eye-opening sections are those that discuss the spirituality of aging and its emotional aspects. "Aging can bring frailty and suffering, but it can also bring depth and richness of experience, complexity of being, serenity, wisdom, and its own kind of power and grace," he writes. At 63, Weil is still a bit shy of senior status, but is aging well indeed, with the legacy of his late 93-year-old mother (who&#x2019;s touchingly eulogized by Weil in this book) to guide him.--<i>Erica Jorgensen</i>Andrew Weil, M.D. is the author of ten previous books, including <i>Spontaneous Healing, Eight Weeks to Optimum Health, Eating Well for Optimum Health,</i> and, with Rosie Daley, <i>The Healthy Kitchen.</i> A graduate of Harvard Medical School, he is clinical professor of medicine and director of the Program in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona.

Family cemeteries and ruins serve as enduring reminders of the farm families who once lived here.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>North District: Skyline Drive from Front Royal to Byrd Visitor Center</b><br> The park&#x2019;s 105-mile long spine is Skyline Drive, a scenic roadway (speed limit 35 mph) built in part along trails blazed by Indians, fur traders, and pioneers.<br> Mileposts begin at zero at the northernmost point&#x2014;Front Royal, Virginia (US 340)&#x2014;and count up as you drive south. The drive and the park end at milepost 105, Rockfish Gap (I-64), where Skyline connects to the Blue Ridge Parkway.<br> Viewing the park in three leisurely driving chunks&#x2014;North, Central, and South&#x2014;makes it more likely you&#x2019;ll take the time to explore the side trails<br> off Skyline Drive and stop at the scenic overlooks.<br> &nbsp;<br> While the 75 overlooks along the ridge-crest route (the high point is 3,680 feet) make the Appalachian mountain vistas accessible to all, appreciating the park requires approaching it as more than a drive- through destination, says Andy Nichols, director of programs for a local guide company. &#x201c;Shenandoah has more than 500 miles of trails, most of which lead to stunning places, but few people ever get out from behind the wheel. There are some often overlooked trails that are true gems.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>1. Fox Hollow Trail</b><br> The first stop for most people who enter the park via Front Royal is the Dickey Ridge Visitor Center, where clean restrooms and an information center are the main draws.<br> &nbsp;<br> Few people venture across Skyline Drive from the center to the Fox Hollow trailhead. The 1.2-mile loop doesn&#x2019;t offer any of Shenandoah&#x2019;s sweeping panoramas, but it does provide a window into the history of the people who lived here before the park was created.<br> &nbsp;<br> The trail is named for the Fox family, tenant farmers here from the early 1800s through 1936. Thomas Fox eventually bought this site from owner Marcus Buck and built a seven- room log house in this area. The forest has reclaimed their cornfields and pastures, but the family&#x2019;s cemetery and homesite remain.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>2.&nbsp;Overall Run/Heiskell Hollow Loop</b><br> If you&#x2019;re physically up to a challenging circuit hike (about 12.5 miles, half that if you only go to the falls and back), this one delivers Shenandoah&#x2019;s best in microcosm.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There are beautiful falls [including the park&#x2019;s tallest, 93-foot Overall Run Falls], great views, and swimming holes near the bottom,&#x201d; says Nichols. &#x201c;In summer the swimming is amazing, and in winter the upper falls are magnificent.&#x201d; (Freezing temps can turn the cascades into icicles.)<br> &nbsp;<br> From Skyline Drive, park at the Matthews Arm Campground amphitheater and follow Traces Trail to the Tuscarora&#x2013;Overall Run Trail, connecting with Heiskell Hollow to complete the circuit.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>3. Beahms Gap</b><br> With 101 miles of the Appalachian Trail (AT) paralleling much of Skyline Drive through the park, it&#x2019;s easy to hike a short section. White blazes on trees mark the AT. Blue signifies park trails, and yellow, horse trails (hiking allowed).<br> &nbsp;<br> The AT crossing near Beahms Gap is only a few hundred yards from the parking area and is a favorite birding spot of biologists Ann Simpson and her husband Rob, co-owners of a local photography business.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;More than 200 species of birds are found in the park,&#x201d; says Ann. &#x201c;In summer, look for scarlet tanagers, indigo buntings, and rose-breasted grosbeaks. In fall, sparrows, eastern towhees, and migrating warblers love the scrubby, insect-filled cover here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Central District: Thornton Gap to Swift Run Gap</b><br> To meet Shenandoah in the middle, enter the park through Thornton Gap or Swift Run Gap, and drive between the two. This is the highest section of the park, and it includes its highest peak, at Hawkskill (4,051 feet), and second highest point, 4,011-foot Stony Man.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>4. Stony Man to Spitler Knoll Overlooks</b><br> With 75 Skyline Drive vista overlooks, it can be difficult to pick the perfect spot to pull off and watch the sun go down. &#x201c;Most of the overlooks are oriented with a westward view into the Allegheny Mountains, so there are many that are nice for sunset pictures,&#x201d; says Rob Simpson.<br> &nbsp;<br> To snap the quintessential Shenandoah sunset vista, the Simpsons suggest staking out an unobstructed view at one of their favorite photo stops along this stretch of Skyline Drive: Stony Man, Timber Hollow, or Spitler Knoll.<br><br><b> 5. Stony Man <br></b>The popular loop hike to the top and back is steep (about 340 feet upward) and rocky (it&#x2019;s called Stony Man for a reason) in spots.<br> &nbsp;<br> At only 1.6 miles, however, it&#x2019;s a short way for some long views west over wave after wave of forested Appalachian Mountain ridges. Park at historic Skyland Resort early in the day to make the climb before the crowds arrive.<br><br> For a shorter option with similar views, hike the trail to Little Stony Man, a 0.9-mile round-trip.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>6. Limberlost Trail</b><br> The easy Limberlost Trail (named for an early 1900s novel) is Shenandoah&#x2019;s most accessible woodlands, wetlands, and wildlife trail.<br> The five-foot-wide crushed green- stone walkway loops through 1.3 miles of forest. Mountain laurels bloom in June and white-tailed deer are regularly spotted here throughout the year.<br> &nbsp;<br> The gentle grades make it possible to push a stroller or wheelchair, but ruts can form and wooden bridge surfaces can get slick when wet. If you&#x2019;re a wheelchair hiker, invite a friend to join you (always a good idea for any hiker on any trail).<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>7. Big Meadows</b><br> The Byrd Visitor Center is a popular rest stop since it sits roughly at the halfway point along Skyline Drive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Take some time here to stretch your legs and walk across Skyline Drive to Big Meadows, the park&#x2019;s largest open vista, suggests Mary Craig, summer park teacher.<br> &nbsp;<br> The meadowlands&#x2019; low-bush blueberry, maleberry, and deerberry bushes; two nutrient-rich wetlands; and native grasses attract abundant wildlife and insects, including some species found nowhere else in Shenandoah.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Early morning or just before sun- set are the best times to wander Big Meadows,&#x201d; says Craig. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a quieter period with fewer visitors and more opportunities to see white-tailed deer and black bears.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> While any of the bigger mammals are fairly obvious, spotting the Jones Run Falls four-toed salamanders, eastern gray tree frogs, upland chorus frogs, and other critters that live here requires walking softly and listening closely. Adds Craig, &#x201c;Unplug from your electronics and have your kids do the same. When you get engaged in the outdoors, you see and hear so much more.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>8. Rapidan Camp</b><br> Before President Franklin Roosevelt established the USS Shangri-La retreat (renamed Camp David) as the presidential country residence, President Herbert Hoover built this fishing camp on the Rapidan River.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Hoovers enjoyed &#x2018;Camp Hoover&#x2019; during the summer months to escape the heat of Washington and to entertain government officials and international guests,&#x201d; explains Ann Simpson. &#x201c;On a pleasant 4-mile round-trip hike along Mill Prong Trail from the Milam Gap parking area, you can reach Rapidan Camp, explore the area, and enjoy the same inspiring mountain trout stream that soothed the souls of many famous national and world leaders.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> To fish here, bring your gear and purchase a five-day nonresident fishing license at the Big Meadows Wayside or a local sporting goods store.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>9. Lewis Mountain Campground</b><br> The campground is the park&#x2019;s smallest, making it a quiet, somewhat secret retreat. When visiting with children, this also is an ideal setting for an impromptu discussion about the civil rights movement, say Ann and Rob Simpson.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Lewis Mountain facilities opened in 1940 as a segregated campground,&#x201d; says Ann Simpson. &#x201c;Later, that segregation ended and the campground was freely shared by everyone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The site is close to the Appalachian Trail, so through-hikers often camp here to shower, wash clothes, and stock up on supplies.<br> &nbsp;<br> Near the campground facilities, hike to the summit of Bearfence Mountain, suggests Rob Simpson. &#x201c;The name comes from the palisade-like rocks resembling a fence that surround the summit. The hike is a fairly easy 1.2- mile circuit to a 360-degree vista.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>South District: Rockfish Gap and North</b><br> &#x201c;The southern edge of Shenandoah is much less populated, but there&#x2019;s still plenty to see and do,&#x201d; says Craig. Approach the park through the southernmost Rockfish Gap Entrance at US 64 for a different perspective.<br> &nbsp;<br> Heading north up Skyline Drive from here, there&#x2019;s generally less traffic, and in early morning and early evening, adds Craig, more chance you&#x2019;ll spot black bears, deer, or wild turkeys walking or feeding near the road.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>10. Jones Run/Doyles River</b><br> In summer, pack a picnic and towel and spend a day cooling off in the swimming holes along this 6.6-mile loop trail, suggests hiking guide Andy Nichols. Park at Browns Gap (mile- post 83) lot, cross Skyline Drive, and follow the AT along the ridge for 1.4 miles to the Jones Run Trail. &#x201c;This is a fun and rewarding hike on a hot day,&#x201d; says Nichols. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not quite as much solitude as some of my other &#x2018;secret&#x2019; hikes, but it&#x2019;s great for water- falls and pools.&#x201d;</p><h2>Hunted (Star Wars: Boba Fett, Book 4)</h2><p>Boba Fett. Jabba the Hutt. The amazing beginning to a legendary partnership. In this book only.<br><br>In the Classic Star Wars movies, Boba Fett works for the legendary Jabba the Hutt, tracking down bounties (including Han Solo). Fans have never known how this partnership began . . . until now.<br> Young Boba Fett has nowhere to go -- and is being hunted for what he knows about the evil Count Dooku. Before Boba's father died, he left instructions for his son to find Jabba the Hutt. Now Boba tracks Jabba down -- and must pass the ultimate test in order to prove he is truly a bounty hunter for the ages.</p><p></p><h2>I Am Rosa Parks</h2><p>&#34;We can all be heroes&#34; is the message entertainingly told in this picture-book biography series from #1 New York Times Bestselling author Brad Meltzer. &#34;Kids always search for heroes, so we might as well have a say in it,&#34; Brad Meltzer realized, and so he envisioned this friendly, fun approach to biography - for his own kids, and for yours. Each book tells the story of one of America&#39;s icons in a vivacious, conversational way that works well for the youngest nonfiction readers, those who aren&#39;t quite ready for the Who Was biography series. Each book focuses on a particular character trait that made that role model heroic. For example, Rosa Parks dared to stand up for herself and other African Americans by staying seated, and as a result she helped end public bus segregation and launch the country&#39;s Civil Rights Movement. This engaging series is the perfect way to bring American history to life for young children, providing them with the right role models, supplementing Common Core learning in the classroom, and best of all, inspiring them to strive and dream.</p><p></p><h2>The Book of Five Rings (The Way of the Warrior Series)</h2><p>Setting down his thoughts on swordplay, on winning, and on spirituality, legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi intended this modest work as a guide for his immediate disciples and future generations of samurai. He had little idea he was penning a masterpiece that would be eagerly devoured by people in all walks of life centuries after his death. <br><br>Along with <em>The Art of War</em> by Sun Tzu, <em>The Book of Five Rings</em> has long been regarded as an invaluable treatise on the strategy of winning. Musashi's timeless advice on defeating an adversary, throwing an opponent off-guard, creating confusion, and other techniques for overpowering an assailant was addressed to the readers of earlier times on the battlefield, and now serves the modern reader in the battle of life. <br><br>In this new rendering by the translator of <em>Hagakure</em> and <em>The Unfettered Mind</em>, William Scott Wilson adheres rigorously to the seventeenth-century Japanese text and clarifies points of ambiguity in earlier translations. In addition, he offers an extensive introduction and a translation of Musashi's rarely published <em>The Way of Walking Alone</em>. This gift-book edition also features original art by Musashi himself as well as new calligraphy by Japanese artist Shiro Tsujimura.</p><p><br>MIYAMOTO MUSASHI (1584-1645) was a renowned swordsman and painter. A masterless samurai, he developed the two-sword style of fighting and emerged victorious in more than 60 sword fights in his travels throughout Japan. The author of <em>The Book of Five Rings</em>, he is also the subject of the novel <em>Musashi</em> by Eiji Yoshikawa.<br><br>WILLIAM SCOTT WILSON, the translator, was born in 1944 and grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. As an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College in 1966, he was invited by a friend to join a three-month kayak trip up the coast of Japan from Shimonoseki to Tokyo. This eye-opening journey, beautifully documented in National Geographic, spurred Wilson's fascination with the culture and history of Japan. <br><br>After receiving a B.A. degree in political science from Dartmouth, Wilson earned a second B.A. in Japanese language and literature from the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies in Monterey, California, then undertook extensive research on Edo-period (1603-1868) philosophy at the Aichi Prefectural University, in Nagoya, Japan. <br><br>Wilson completed his first translation, <em>Hagakure</em>, while living in an old farmhouse deep in the Japanese countryside. Hagakure saw publication in 1979, the same year Wilson completed an M.A. in Japanese language and literature at the University of Washington. Wilson's other translations include <em>The</em> <em>Book of Five Rings</em>, <em>The Life-Giving Sword</em>, <em>The Unfettered Mind</em>, the Eiji Yoshikawa novel <em>Taiko</em>, and Ideals of the Samurai, which has been used as a college textbook on Japanese history and thought. Two decades after its initial publication, <em>Hagakure</em> was prominently featured in the Jim Jarmusch film <em>Ghost Dog</em>.<br><br>Wilson currently lives in Miami, Florida.<br>&#34;On Wall Street, when Musashi talks, people listen&#34; -Time Magazine &#34;Musashi&#39;s teachings read like lessons from the latest business management gurus.

He lives in Virginia with his wife, Ruth.<br>WUNDERLAND1<br>The jungle was eerily quiet.<br>Hugging the uneven ground behind a thin screen of greenery, Nathan Graynor peered over the precipice to where a dirt road followed the narrow, undulating floor of a steep-walled canyon. The suns, one yellow and one orange, were high overhead. Anyone glancing up from the road toward either ridge would only see glare.<br>The perfect time and place for an ambush.<br>The day was cool and a breeze blew steadily. Still, sweat trickled down Nathan&#x2019;s face. Nerves, he told himself, knowing that was at best a half truth.<br>With the barrel of his laser rifle, he nudged aside a frond for a clearer look. (The fern was green, clearly terrestrial. Across the rugged gorge where the second group of rebels hid, the red-gold vegetation was as plainly native.) Ruts and potholes scarred the primitive road: no obstacle for antigrav vehicles, but scarcely navigable for anything with wheels.<br>He wasn&#x2019;t afraid, not exactly. Fear would have required truly believing that this was happening, that he was here.<br>Life had been that way, surreal, since the missile punched through Clementine. The emergency restraints in the pilot&#x2019;s couch had saved him. Everyone else aboard died when the ship broke apart. Resistance fighters reached the wreckage first. Deep in shock, unquestioningly, he had gone with them.<br>He took small, measured sips from his canteen. He took deep, cleansing breaths. When neither calmed him, he looked skyward for serenity, at the birds and their native equivalents soaring effortlessly in the thermals that rose from the plain. That didn&#x2019;t work, either.<br>In the Resistance camp he had drawn plenty of sideways glances. The rebels didn&#x2019;t fully trust him&#x2014;yet here he was. Maybe they had chosen not to leave him behind unguarded. Maybe, finally, they felt comfortable with him. Or maybe they wanted to see if he would bolt into the jungle given the chance. (Would they have let him go? He didn&#x2019;t think so.)<br>One way or another, his presence here was a test.<br>A faint droning drifted Nathan&#x2019;s way, and hints of metallic clanking. Over the plain below, in the far distance where jungle still hid the road, a cloud of brown dust now hovered.<br>Their target approached.<br>The aristos controlled space around Wunderland more completely every day. Nathan&#x2014;and even more so, his former crew&#x2014;had learned that the hard way. Snoopersats might intercept even the briefest radio whisper. And so from Nathan&#x2019;s left, where Logan, the leader of this guerrilla band, lay hidden, the most basic of signals: a soft avian trill.<br>Get ready.<br>Nathan whistled an acknowledgment as best he could, not knowing what he tried to imitate. More &#x201c;birdsong&#x201d; to his right and from across the gorge. The guerrillas wore camouflage over their improvised armor; even with their whistles to guide him, he spotted no one. Seven answers in all, including Nathan&#x2019;s own.<br>The crossfire would be deadly.<br>Reviewing what had passed for training&#x2014;mostly &#x201c;If it reflects, don&#x2019;t shoot it&#x201d; and &#x201c;If you see them, assume they see you&#x201d;&#x2014;Nathan raised the laser rifle to his shoulder. (There had been a lesson, too, on improvising explosive devices from house hold chemicals. Making bombs scared the hell out of him, and he tried his best to leave that knowledge theoretical. Seeing his hands shake, others had built the explosives now hidden in the ravine far below.) Through the scope he followed the barely-a-path across the rocky plain below. Not-quite trees swayed where the road entered the lower jungle.<br>The first vehicles emerged: tractors, cargo floaters, flatbed trucks. Civilian vehicles, all. People jammed the truck beds, balanced precariously on the sideboards, plodded alongside on foot. Another few minutes would bring the caravan into the canyon. Into the trap.<br>Birds circled high overhead, indistinct against the suns&#x2019; glare. Their presence, perhaps, signified nothing.<br>In his mind&#x2019;s eye they were vultures.<br>Cranking up the magnification Nathan saw more women and children than men. Everyone kept glancing fearfully over their shoulders. He saw a few dogs and even a sway-backed horse. Here and there people clutched hunting rifles, but that didn&#x2019;t make them the enemy. Who would venture into this wilderness unarmed?<br>He zoomed closer still, examined weary faces. Half the adults looked old. Boosterspice was plentiful, if pricey; to look old meant you were poor. Most men&#x2019;s chins were stubbled, but of asymmetric, pointy-on-one-side/close-cropped-on-the-other beards, Nathan saw not a one. Only Wunderland&#x2019;s aristos sported those ridiculous, high-maintenance affectations as symbols of indolence and leisure.<br>This couldn&#x2019;t be the rumored garrison resupply convoy. Nathan waited for the call to stand down. Instead, from his left, a brief chittering.<br>On my signal.<br>Madness! These were civilian refugees. Poor farmers by the look of them and of their vehicles. Why the tanj ambush them? Nathan cleared his throat.<br>&#x201c;Quiet!&#x201d; Logan hissed.<br>For the first time since getting stranded, Nathan wondered if one side was any better than another.<br>Be honest, he chided himself. The second time. The first time was when two guerrillas marched a third, her face bruised, the cloth badge of the Resistance ripped from her blouse, out of camp into the jungle. Only the men, their expressions grim, had returned.<br>Nathan had chosen to believe they had sent her away. These people had pulled him from the wreck, whisked him away before Internal Security arrived. He owed the guerrillas everything, from the shirt on his back to his very life.<br>Now he wondered if he could live with the debt.<br>As the hum of engines swelled, Nathan&#x2019;s mind churned. Join in the slaughter? Never. Stand by, doing nothing, and watch? How was that better?<br>There had to be another way. A warning shot to scare off the civilians? No. The laser beam between plain and cliff top would point back at him. That woman vanished into the woods outside camp . . . Nathan had a pretty good idea how the Resistance treated sympathizers. Or&#x2014;<br>Probably no one was looking up. Nathan raised his rifle and fired. With a squawk a bird stopped its circling. Gravity here was scarcely half that to which Nathan was accustomed, and the bird, cut almost in two, fell in slow motion.<br>Splat went the carcass, just ahead of the caravan.<br>The people on foot turned and ran, zigzagging, back toward the trees. Engines raced. Vehicles jerked into reverse or turned off the road to circle back. Maybe he had saved a few&#x2014;<br>Crash! A tractor and a truck collided, blocking the way into the jungle.<br>&#x201c;Now!&#x201d; shouted Logan.<br>From both canyon rims guerrillas opened fire. Laser beams, silent, scythed down three men before anyone below noticed. Then: screams. Curses. More bodies crumpling. Chaos.<br>It was a massacre, sickening&#x2014;<br>Sudden motion behind the slaughter. Sleek and sharklike, three antigrav gunships burst from the jungle, their charge spookily silent. Laser cannon blazed bloodred. As the gunships neared, their railguns let loose.<br>The guerrillas launched their only two surface-to-air missiles. One hit. Trailing smoke, its engine stuttering, a gunship arced down, down, down. . . . It smashed&#x2014;boom!&#x2014;into a cliff face, and the ground shook. Across the gorge two men more brave than sane (&#x201c;If you see them, assume they see you!&#x201d;) kept firing. The remaining gunships spewed their own missiles.<br>No one could have survived those blasts.<br>&#x201c;Fall back!&#x201d; Logan shouted.<br>At least Nathan, his ears ringing, decided that was the order. He was already slithering backward, away from the precipice and deeper into the jungle, as quickly as he could.<br>He had done what he could for the refugees. The thought offered no comfort.<br>The caravan was doubly bait. The militia had used civilians to entice the Resistance. The guerrillas, just as callous, had attacked the refugees to lure an aristo patrol into reach.<br>Blam! Blam-blam!<br>More missiles. The ground slammed Nathan, flung him high into the air. He came down stunned. Through the underbrush, backlit by explosions, he glimpsed a profile. It loomed over him, well over two meters tall. What with the low gravity, most Wunderlanders were gigantic.<br>One of the guerrillas. Cody something. Was he here to help Nathan or kill him?<br>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; Cody growled. Maybe he hadn&#x2019;t seen Nathan warn the refugees. &#x201c;Time to go.&#x201d;<br>As Nathan struggled to his feet, another blast bounced him off a tree trunk. His left arm and some ribs snapped. And something molten had spattered his camo. It ate through the cloth, through his body armor. The bellow of railguns swallowed his scream.<br>Cody sprayed first-aid foam over the hole in Nathan&#x2019;s vest and his side went numb. The Wunderlander helped Nathan to his feet and together they staggered into the jungle.<br>A YELLOW OVAL GLEAMED on the sloping roof. Not a sun, Nathan gradually decided. The glow of a lamp, reflected on . . . what? How long had he been staring at the glow and why were his thoughts so fuzzy?<br>He looked around. He was flat on his back on one narrow cot among many. All the cots were filled, most by people wearing bloody bandages. He remembered the jungle being eerily quiet. Now that dubious honor belonged to this . . . ?<br>First-aid ward, he decided. In a futzy cave. Geological time later, he figured it out: body heat. Snoopersats would zero in on any camp this size in the wild.<br>He didn&#x2019;t remember getting here. Cody had carried Nathan out, then.<br>Had anyone else among the guerrillas made it? Nathan sat up, the better to check the other beds. He noticed his cast before trying to put any weight on that arm.<br>But he had forgotten about the ribs and the burn. He gasped. The one person standing&#x2014;a medic?&#x2014;was tweaking the flow rate on a drip bag. She turned her head. &#x201c;Be with you in a minute, soldier.&#x201d;<br>Drip bag. Cast. Bloody tanj bandages! Blurry though his mind was, it hit Nathan: this was medieval. He should be asleep, oblivious, within a computerized cocoon dedicated to healing him. But did the guerrillas even have autodocs? He couldn&#x2019;t recall seeing any.<br>He had felt fine until he sat up. Now all he felt was the throbbing in his side. Pain was so . . . archaic. Finagle, he couldn&#x2019;t remember when autodocs came into general use. Well before his time, and he was 130. He didn&#x2019;t know how to deal with pain. No one did anymore. His head spun and his breathing raced&#x2014;<br>&#x201c;Careful.&#x201d; The medic, her sweat-dark hair gathered in an untidy bun, caught Nathan as he toppled. She helped him lie back down, then squirted something into his IV. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s a little something for the pain.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; he said, a moment too late. Maybe that tardiness was no accident. The first wave of relief kicked in and it felt familiarly wonderful. &#x201c;How much of this stuff have I . . . ?&#x201d;<br>He drifted off before finishing the question.<br>ACROSS THE WORLDS of Human Space, people disdained the Wunderlander aristos. Running a blockade to deliver medical supplies to freedom fighters was noble. Running a blockade to sell medical supplies? That dimmed the luster, but it was still in a good cause.<br>Wasn&#x2019;t it?<br>Things were less black and white viewed up close. Wunderland&#x2019;s civil war, like all civil wars, was nasty. It sundered families. It offered no quarter and expected none. It recognized no civilians, no innocents, no neutral parties. Benefit of the doubt was a scarce commodity&#x2014;<br>A nonexistent commodity once you&#x2019;d bled DNA all over a wrecked blockade runner.<br>Through a drug fog Nathan struggled to make sense of things. He had not set out to be a smuggler, any more than he had set out to be a master chef, a mechanic, a pilot, or any of the other things he had been. No career, no hobby, no marriage could last for a century. He had had honest, if mercenary, intentions buying a share of the med shipment. Joining Clementine&#x2019;s crew thereafter was simply prudent, just protecting his investment.<br>He had deluded himself, of course.<br>A respite from the dull routine yet another career had become? Of course. A way to get beyond Paula Cherenkov dumping him? Running the blockade was that, too.<br>Sinking back into hazy oblivion, Nathan confronted a harder truth. He ran&#x2014;still&#x2014;from far older demons.<br></p><h2>Blocks, Borders, Quilts!: A Mix-and-Match Workbook for Designing Your Own Quilts</h2><p><p>This is not your typical patchwork-block book.

But just as well written and maybe more fun are his Kidd books, of which this is the fourth. Kidd is a professional thief for the Internet age: a cyberprowler, a hacker extraordinaire. In <i>The Hanged Man's Song</i>, he gets word that one of his key contacts--a superhacker known only as Bobby, whom Kidd has never met but has relied on many times--has disappeared. Kidd and an old buddy, both of whom could be compromised by data in Bobby's files, go looking for him. Finding his brutally murdered body draws them into a Hitchcock-esque intrigue that eventually involves stolen government secrets, crooked politicians, and a rogue CIA agent who's as crafty as he is creepy.<p> While filling his tale with fascinating and authentic-sounding lore about the hacker subculture, identity theft, and security cracking, Sandford keeps the action brisk with plenty of white-knuckle chases, tense stakeouts, and hairsbreadth escapes. Couple that with a smart, agreeable narrator and a cast of vivid characters evoked with an old pro's ease, and you've got one winning thriller. <i>--Nicholas H.

She has counted Jennifer Jones, Betsy Bloomingdale, Elizabeth Taylor, Goldie Hawn, and Camille Cosby among her favorite clients.<br> <br> But behind the glamorous facade, Carrie&#x2019;s world was in perpetual disarray and always had been. After her father abandoned the family when she was still a child, she was sexually abused by her domineering stepfather, and her alcoholic mother was unstable and unreliable. Carrie was sipping cocktails before her tenth birthday, and had had five children and three husbands before her twenty-eighth. She fueled the frenetic pace of her professional life with a steady diet of champagne and vodka, diet pills, cocaine, and heroin, until she eventually lost her home, her car, her career&#x2014;and nearly her children. But she battled her way back, getting sober, rebuilding her relationships and her reputation as a hairdresser, and today, the name Carrie White is once again on the door of one of Beverly Hills&#x2019;s most respected salons. An unflinching portrayal of addiction and recovery, <i>Upper Cut </i>proves that even in Hollywood, sometimes you have to fight for a happy ending.</p><p><b> <b>Hollywood High</b> </b> <br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me, but are you a Delta?&#x201d; a girl asked, talking down to me.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, I think I&#x2019;m a Lutheran.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you can&#x2019;t sit there if you&#x2019;re not a Delta.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was my first day at Hollywood High School. I was sitting on a bench in the quad area. I had never heard of a <i>quad</i> before this school. Who was she ... the quad police? And what the hell was a Delta anyway?<br> <br><i>Screw her</i>. I didn&#x2019;t see a sign that said <i>Private Property</i>. I just wanted to eat my damn lunch.<br> <br>She looked at me like I was a Christmas decoration at an Easter party. I felt the pencil melting off my arched eyebrows and my red lipstick cracking. No one else was wearing a tight pegged calf-length skirt, a black sweater with a false collar tucked in, a stacked pachuca hairdo adorned with spit curls on each side, and dangling Mexican earrings. I walked over to the other side of the bench around the big tree.<br> <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t sit there either,&#x201d; she barked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the Lambdas&#x2019; bench. And that other tree over there&#x201d;&#x2014;she pointed&#x2014;&#x201c;that&#x2019;s the Betas&#x2019; bench. And those benches over there&#x201d;&#x2014;she pointed to another and another&#x2014;&#x201c;is the Thetas&#x2019; bench and that one is the Alphas&#x2019;. So don&#x2019;t sit there either, unless you&#x2019;re an Alpha, a Beta, a Lambda, or a Theta.&#x201d; She looked me up and down. &#x201c;And I doubt you are.&#x201d;<br> <br>The social scene at Hollywood High School was harder than Pacoima. They just gave their gangs different names. I had never heard of the word <i>sorority</i> or known Greek letters had names. This Delta chick looked very different from Pacoima and <i>me</i>. She was polished like an apple, like a picture on a package, like a television commercial. Everything matched, from her white patent leather purse and white patent Mary Jane shoes to her powder blue fuzzy sweater with another tied around her shoulders. Her pleated beige skirt didn&#x2019;t look like me either and her round bubble hairdo didn&#x2019;t move. Her lips were glossy white.<br> <br>What kind of lipstick was <i>white</i>?<br> <br>I took a deep breath. <i>She&#x2019;s not going to get me, and neither are all the damn letters of the Greek alphabet</i>. I remembered the administration building nearby had a large bathroom. Certainly that couldn&#x2019;t be Delta territory. I turned around quickly, and walked without hesitation toward the brick office building, brown paper bag and books in hand. I kept thinking, left or right, which way is the bathroom? <i>Don&#x2019;t stop to ask anyone</i>.<br> <br>I was crushed, trying not to show it, trying not to cry. Not from that bratty bitch, but from what the hell was going to become of me here? It didn&#x2019;t look good. I pulled open the heavy-windowed door, breezed in like I had been there for years, passing students like I was so busy with important things to do. I spotted the sign, Girls&#x2019; Room. Hold on just a little bit further. I walked faster, got to the door and exhaled the breath I&#x2019;d been holding.<br> <br>Inside, there were a few girls fussing with their hair, chatting. They didn&#x2019;t notice me. I saw no feet in the third stall, plowed into it, plunked down on the seat, and locked the door. Safe. I hated to cry. It was a sign of weakness, pointless, and never helped. I took a big breath, stacked my books on my lap like a tray, and unfolded my brown paper bag. I could hardly swallow the dry peanut butter sandwich I had made.<br> <br>For one week, I sat in that locked toilet cubicle having lunch, constantly wondering about those damn Deltas. Finally bored and annoyed, I figured there was more to this school than classes and a toilet. There must be a Delta in one of my classes. I needed to learn more. I became the Delta detective. Then one day in art class, I heard a new friend, Eve Babitz, talking about the Delta Hell Night coming up. I scooted closer, looking at her drawing. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a Hell Night?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well ... first you have to be rushed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s <i>rushed</i>?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s when you are asked by a club to join, then you begin pledging.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s <i>pledging</i>?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s when you do anything they ask, and I mean anything! It takes a week, and if you pass, you have the final test, Hell Night.&#x201d;<br> <br>Upon further research, I found the Deltas happened to be the coolest and snobbiest girls. They had privileged backgrounds. Their parents were famous or rich or both. I had none of these qualifications. I liked the challenge. I was determined to be a Delta, if only for vengeance.<br> <br>Using my survival techniques, I saw that if I had a different walk, different talk, and most important, <i>different hair</i>, maybe I could be a girl the Deltas might invite in. As my mother the artist would say after another boyfriend broke up with her, <i>back to the drawing board</i>.<br> <br>First of all, I hated my name, Carole ... so common. When I complained to my mother that seven girls in my class had the name Carol, she said, &#x201c;But you have an <i>e</i> on the end of your name, you were named after Carole Lombard, your <i>Carole</i> is beautiful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, when the teacher calls <i>Carol</i>, she doesn&#x2019;t say, the one with the <i>e</i> on the end.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Carole&#x201d; had to go. I remembered back in Pacoima Junior High, a new girl in seventh grade announced her name was Carrie, a name I had never heard before. I loved the uniqueness. I had been name-shopping for ages, and I thought of stealing it then, but I had dropped the idea when the Renegades nicknamed me Suki. Outside of Pacoima and a gang party, Suki sounded like a Japanese dog. Entering this new school was the perfect time for me to take this perfect name.<br> <br>I started telling everyone: &#x201c;My real name was Carole, but my mother calls me <i>Carrie</i> for short.&#x201d; Then I told my mother: &#x201c;If someone calls and asks for <i>Carrie</i>, that&#x2019;s me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You? Why would any one call you <i>that</i>?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Mom, they just do ... it&#x2019;s a nickname.&#x201d;<br> <br>So that was that. I was unofficially, officially Carrie, Carrie Enwright. And that was Enwright with a <i>w</i>.<br> <br>Next project was my clothes and hair. I dumped my socks, my bunny shoes, false collars, and full Mexican skirts in the wastebasket. I didn&#x2019;t know where these Hollywood High girls got their looks, but I was sure it wasn&#x2019;t in a store like Anita&#x2019;s off San Fernando Road. They talked about Geistex sweaters and Lanz dresses, <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i>. Then there was the world of Max Factor, a makeup store across the street from Hollywood High ... how convenient.<br> <br>I listened carefully to the girls in gym chat about Hollywood Boulevard and shopping at The Broadway and Lerner&#x2019;s Dress Shop. I&#x2019;d never been inside a large department store. I told my mother that none of my clothes fit. I would get a job or help her ink and paint, but I had to have a new wardrobe or I was not going to school.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; she said, and gave me fifty dollars. That was the most money I had ever seen at one time. I shopped wisely so I could get the most for the money. I even found a cardigan that looked like a Geistex. I think one real Geistex sweater cost <i>more</i> than fifty dollars. I bought two knee-length kick-pleat skirts, an angora sweater, and a few blouses. I bought bracelets instead of my usual dangling earrings. Now I had a chance to conquer this new turf. Oh wait, shoes, they tell a lot. I had enough money left over to go to Leeds shoe store, also on Hollywood Boulevard. I bought little flats like that pretty Delta, Rosalind Frank, wore.<br> <br>But the most important detail was her hair, and I knew I needed to change mine. The Hollywood High hairdo had a name: the Flip. I would study the girls&#x2019; hair, imagining how they get it to curl up on the bottom. And I needed to cut bangs, smooth bangs that swooped to one side, not like my mother&#x2019;s 1940s movie star bangs. I learned in Pacoima and it held true in Hollywood: <i>If I could get my hair right, my life would work better</i>.<br> <br>Rosalind Frank was in my gym class. I spotted her right away, she reminded me so much of Beverly. She was very pretty and always seemed to have the answer when anyone asked her anything. Rosalind was sharp and assertive and didn&#x2019;t take any crap. She had a Delta friend, Taffy Paul, whom I also admired. I especially liked her name. Taffy would be my new Charlotte. She was smart and sophisticated, rode horses, and studied drama like me. Then there was Louise, Roz&#x2019;s best friend, soon to be her second-best friend, because I was going to be Rosalind&#x2019;s best friend.<br> <br>I made sure Roz heard me in the locker room, when I would talk about my mother being an artist at MGM and that she had been in films herself.<br> <br>Finally, Roz said one day, &#x201c;Do you want to come to Coffee Dan&#x2019;s today?&#x201d;<br> <br>I knew this was <i>the</i> after-school spot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; I answered, not wanting to be too anxious.<br> <br>&#x201c;We meet at the <i>Delta bench</i> at three-fifteen ... do you know where that is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find it.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the final school bell rang, I knew this was it, like a first date: win the Deltas over or end up a dud. Roz was waiting at the Delta bench.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, everyone,&#x201d; she said. They looked up. &#x201c;This is Carrie, she&#x2019;s new.&#x201d; They nodded and went back to chatting. Roz said to me, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re waiting for one other girl, do you know Suzy Sparks?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s a Delta, her mother played Blondie on television,&#x201d; Roz whispered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh ...&#x201d; I knew the comic strip, but I&#x2019;d never seen the TV show.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Barbara Parkins over there,&#x201d; Rosalind said. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s an actress and she&#x2019;s talking to our Delta president, Kathy; her dad is Dana Andrews, famous movie star, you&#x2019;ve heard of him, right? You&#x2019;ll meet everyone at Coffee Dan&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>Suzy Sparks came up, talking about getting a <i>new</i> car for her birthday.<br> <br>Another girl rushed over. &#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late.&#x201d; She was <i>that bratty-bitchy girl that booted me off this bench</i>. Good ... she didn&#x2019;t recognize me, probably because of my new Flip.<br> <br>We paraded up Highland and turned at the corner of the Max Factor building to the coffee shop on Hollywood Boulevard. I followed Rosalind. I sat next to Taffy. She was a barrel of laughs, making fun of everything. The conversation settled on the plans for an Easter vacation in Palm Springs.<br> <br>Rosalind and I were becoming closer. I was dazzled by her. She always had the perfect hairstyle, perfect makeup&#x2014;from Max Factor Essence of Pearl lipstick to painted eyeliner that curled up at the corner of her eyes&#x2014;and it seemed she had a new outfit every day, plus many <i>real</i> Geistex sweaters. One day she wore a black spaghetti-strap sheath to school. It was shocking.<br> <br>She said, blas�, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s <i>Friday</i>.&#x201d;<br> <br>All the boys were crazy over Rosalind. She dressed older than her age and walked like she was a pageant queen. She had that edge like Beverly. It was confidence and <i>that</i> was glamorous.<br> <br>I was struck by <i>glamour</i> since I was four years old, by my one and only grandmother, my mother&#x2019;s mother. She lived in her own world with her movie scrapbooks and vaudeville clippings of herself. She always wore bright red lipstick and had a big dimple in her cheek that she said was just for me. She would constantly tell me, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the apple of my eye.&#x201d; As hard as I searched her eyes, I could never quite locate that apple, but I believed her. Sometimes she took me to the fancy Clifton&#x2019;s Cafeteria downtown. We would dress up and she would say, &#x201c;Order <i>whatever</i> you like.&#x201d; Once we went there for her birthday. &#x201c;Your nana is <i>fifty</i> years old, don&#x2019;t I look good for my age?&#x201d; I had no idea about age, except that it seemed important to look good.<br> <br>Nana was a manicurist at this point in her multicolored life; her modest apartment was filled with framed autographed photos as if they were art or trophies. The haunting gaze of the magnificent Hedy Lamarr captivated me, along with another woman who had an even more intriguing face. On my tiptoes, I would hang on to Nana&#x2019;s lace-clothed dressing table, studying this woman&#x2019;s huge black eyes and eyebrows. Her name was Joan Crawford. She gave my grandmother her daughter&#x2019;s old clothes to pass on to me. My favorite was a wallaby coat, a fur from Australia.<br> <br>Nana had run away from home to be in the circus when she was twelve. Later she performed in vaudeville, dressing like a man because women were not allowed onstage at that time. She met and married my grandfather, a magician and xylophonist, when she was seventeen. Through the vaudeville circuit, they became good friends with comedian Stan Laurel. My grandparents had many theatrical connections and as a result they arranged for my mother to act in many <i>Our Gang</i> comedies. This led to my mother&#x2019;s aspiring starlet days while attending Beverly Hills High School. My mother and grandmother had parts in the Laurel and Hardy film <i>Babes in Toyland</i>. This was their big Hollywood fame. Now Nana was living not too far from my mother and me, in a little apartment, alone, never having remarried after my grandfather left her, before I was born.<br> <br>Strutting down the hall after first period, Rosalind popped the question: &#x201c;How would you like to be a Delta?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ummm, I hadn&#x2019;t given it much thought,&#x201d; I said, screaming <i>whoopee</i> inside.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why not? We do spend so much time together.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pledge week: I had to wear a paper toilet seat around my neck during lunch and tell everyone I was an ass. I had to come to school without makeup. That was the worst for me, but not as bad as the other two pledges who had to walk around school with a grape up each nostril during lunchtime.<br> <br>I was well on my way to owning that Delta bench. Then came Hell Night.<br> <br>We all met at Kathy the president&#x2019;s house. Her father, Dana Andrews, came down the sweeping staircase in his smoking jacket, hair slicked back like I remembered my father&#x2019;s. &#x201c;Having a little gathering with your friends tonight, darling?&#x201d; he said to Kathy at the entry, then stepped into his private library and closed the big white door behind him. I was excited to be in this luxurious home in the Hollywood Hills&#x2014;a movie star home. Kathy hollered through the closed door, &#x201c;Daddy, you can&#x2019;t come into the kitchen. We&#x2019;re having a ceremony, okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, dear.&#x201d;<br> <br>We all went into the den. Pledges were told to sit on the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the most important night of your life,&#x201d; Kathy announced. &#x201c;Do I hear any objections to any of these nominations?&#x201d; <i>I hoped that girl from the first day at the Delta bench didn&#x2019;t make trouble for me</i>. &#x201c;Pledges, raise your hand if you are ready to proceed.&#x201d; We slowly raised our hands. Taffy and Roz looked so serious. A few more girls I hadn&#x2019;t met were there. They were <i>alumnae</i> Deltas.<br> <br>&#x201c;Follow me to the sacred kitchen, one lowly pledge at a time.&#x201d; Kathy directed Ruth to be first.<br> <br>I heard her scream, &#x201c;Not me, I&#x2019;m not going to eat that.&#x201d; Then I heard nothing. After ten long minutes Ruth came out, watery-eyed, with a faint self-preserving smile, and sat back down like a trained pup. Another girl did the same, only she barfed on herself afterward.<br> <br>&#x201c;Next ...&#x201d; Kathy called from the kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s you,&#x201d; the girls said synchronously. Escorted by Roz, I walked into the kitchen. The lights were off. Little candles were lit on every counter, and on top of the refrigerat...&#x201c;As one of Hollywood's most sought after hairstylists, White tells a rollercoaster of hair, celebrities and surviving life in the fast lane...White's voice is captivating...and her story is an inspiring one, spiked with Hollywood gossip.&#x201d; --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>&#x201c;White writes insightfully...an engaging, celebrity-filled life story.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>"Carrie White reveals a life as dramatic as any Hollywood movie...[her] autobiography is as inspirational as it is cautionary, an often larger-than-life story about chasing your dreams, while also offering a graphic depiction of substance abuse.

Harris looks beyond the popular image of Restoration England reveling in its freedom from the austerity of Puritan rule under a merry monarch and reconstructs the human tragedy of Restoration politics where people were brutalized, hounded, and exploited by a regime that was desperately insecure after two decade of civil war and republican rule.</p><p><b>Tim Harris </b>is Professor of History at Brown University.

But ten-year-old Isabel Feeney is unusual . . . unusually obsessed with being a news reporter. She can&#x2019;t believe her luck when she stumbles not only into a real-live murder scene, but also into her hero, the famous journalist Maude Collier. The story of how the smart, curious, loyal Isabel fights to defend the honor of her accused friend and latches on to the murder case like a dog on a pant leg makes for a winning, thoroughly entertaining middle grade mystery.</p><p><p><b>Beth Fantaskey&nbsp;</b>is the author of <i>Jessica's Guide to Dating on the Dark Side, Jessica Rules the Dark Side, Jekel Loves Hyde, </i>and <i>Buzz&nbsp;Kill.&nbsp;</i>She<i></i>lives in rural Pennsylvania with her husband and two daughters. Visit her website at www.bethfantaskey.com.</p>Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Chicago in the 1920s provides the setting for this fast-paced mystery. Isabel Feeney is the spunky protagonist who makes friends, young and old, while hot on the trail of a killer. Isabel sells copies of the Chicago Tribune on the city streets to supplement her single mother's salary. When Isabel hears a gun fire, she runs toward the sound to an alley where she sees Miss Giddings, the kind and pretty young lady who regularly buys newspapers from her, kneeling over a dead man. Isabel is quickly involved in the investigation and befriends Maude Collier, a famous Tribune reporter whom she admires for her reporting excellence. Isabel has always aspired to be a female crime reporter, just like Maude, and now is her chance to investigate a real crime with her writing hero. Fantaskey keeps the chapters short and snappy, with each one ending on a mini-cliff-hanger, enticing kids to read on. There are guns and gangsters, future movie stars, glamour, sibling rivalries, bullet proof cars, polio, several possible suspects, and a host of eclectic personalities. Isabel is fearless but expresses her vulnerability in her desire to have friends.

Other topics include child welfare in a global context, issues relating to immigration and refugees, cultural competence including services to gay/lesbian children and families, and the relation of substance abuse and domestic violence to child welfare.As in earlier editions, the book takes a comprehensive approach to child and family services and policies, covering preventive services, day care and child development programs, income security, juvenile justice, and advocacy as well as thorough treatment of protective services, kinship care, family preservation, and adoption.

In <i>The Death of the Heart</i>, Bowen's writing rolls ever onward, accruing the sensations and ironies of conscious living till the final effect is massive. This is not prose for people who like their fiction with a cool, Calvin Klein-like minimalism. Bowen's people are keenly aware, and she seems to catalogue every sweaty moment, every betraying glance. The reader must stay right there with her, because hidden among lengthy descriptions of sea air and drawing-room politics are pithy asides worthy of great humorists: "Absence blots people out. We really have no absent friends." Skimmers miss out.<p> <i>The Death of the Heart</i> is Bowen's most perfectly made book. Portia, an orphan, comes to live in London with her half-brother, Thomas, and his wife, Anna. A child of sin raised in a series of shabby French hotels, Portia is possessed of a kind of terrible innocence. Like Chance the Gardener in pigtails, she literally can't comprehend evil or unkind motives. Unfortunately for her, she falls in with Anna's friend Eddie, who seems to be made entirely of bad motives. Though the plot follows Portia's relationship with Eddie, the novel's real tension lies between Portia and Anna, as the girl comes to grief against the shoals of Anna's glittering, urbane cynicism. But the book transcends the theme of innocence corrupted. As in Graham Greene's <i>The Quiet American</i>, Bowen inverts the formula to show the destructive power of innocence itself: </p><blockquote>Innocence so constantly finds itself in a false position that inwardly innocent people learn to be disingenuous.... Incurable strangers to the world, they never cease to exact a heroic happiness. Their singleness, their ruthlessness, their one continuous wish makes them bound to be cruel, and to suffer cruelty. The innocent are so few that two of them seldom meet--and when they do, their victims lie strewn all around.</blockquote> Bowen has a fine eye for such shadings of morality, but finer still is her understanding of the way humans bump up against the material world. Her writing on weather, both emotional and meteorological, compares with the best of Henry James: "One's first day by the sea, one's being feels salt, strong, resilient, and hollow--like a seaweed pod not giving under the heel."<p> Always a sensitive observer of the way we live, in her lesser books Bowen deals in mind games and then delivers trumped-up, bloody endings. In <i>The Death of the Heart</i>, she keeps all the action between her characters' ears, and comes up with one of the great midcentury psychological novels. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>Elizabeth Bowen is widely considered to be one of the greatest novelists of this century. While her novels masquerade as witty comedies of manners, set in the lavish country houses of the Anglo-Irish or in elegant London homes, they mine the depths of private tragedy with a subtle ferocity and psychological complexity reminiscent of Henry James.<p>The Death of the Heart, a story of adolescent love and the betrayal of innocence, is perhaps Bowen's best-known book. When sixteen-year-old Portia, recently orphaned, arrives in London and falls for an attractive cad -- a seemingly carefree young man who is as much an outsider in the sophisticated and politely treacherous world of 1930s drawing rooms as she is -- their collision threatens to shatter the carefully built illusions of everyone around them. As she deftly and delicately exposes the cruelty that lurks behind the polished surfaces of conventional society, Bowen reveals herself as a masterful novelist who combines a sharp sense of humor with a devastating gift for divining human motivations.</p></p><h2>Civil to Strangers</h2><p>Here is vintage Pym--a warm, witty slice of uniquely rural English life, meticulously written and spiced with Pym&#39;s keen social observations and her band of hilarious, eccentric characters.</p><p>Barbara Pym (1913-1980) published fourteen books beginning in 1950 and continued until her death. A writer from the age of sixteen, Barbara Pym has been acclaimed as &#34;the most underrated writer of the century&#34; by the late British poet laureate, Philip Larkin. Her 1977 novel, Quartet in Autumn, was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.Understated and proper, maintaining unflappability no matter what&#39;s roiling beneath the surface--that&#39;s the way of the British and the way of a Barbara Pym story. And that&#39;s what we get from Gretel Davis, narrator of CIVIL TO STRANGERS, a posthumously published volume comprising a novel, three novellas, four short stories, and an autobiographical essay on Pym&#39;s writing career. Using well-sharpened insight and description, Pym whittles away at mundane lives to reveal the drama beneath the soul-squelching compromises that got the characters where they are. Understated yet full of possibility, Davis&#39;s tone seems right for the deceptive simplicity of Pym&#39;s stories. T.F.

The idea of wearing clothes and shoes originated on false shame and guilt. The nudist idea is really quite a simple one: there is no such thing as obscene body parts, that rather than being an object of shame and ridicule the human body is an amazing and remarkable organism. Thus the naked, unshod physical body in delightful contact with fresh air, the ground and sunlight ought to be honored not derogated.</p><p></p><h2>A Cross-Stitch Christmas: Gifts to Cherish (Better Homes and Gardens)</h2><p>Provides cross-stitch patterns for Christmas samplers, decorations, stockings, and gifts</p><p></p><h2>This Momentary Marriage: A Parable of Permanence</h2><p><p>Reflecting on forty years of matrimony, John Piper exalts the biblical meaning of marriage over its emotion, exhorting couples to keep their covenant for all the best reasons.</p> <p>Even in the days when people commonly stayed married "'til death do us part," there has never been a generation whose view of marriage was high enough, says Pastor John Piper. That is all the more true in our casual times.</p> <p>Though personal selfishness and cultural bondage obstruct the wonder of God's purpose, it is found in God's Word, where his design can awaken a glorious vision capable of freeing every person from small, Christ-ignoring, romance-intoxicated views. As Piper explains in reflecting on forty years of matrimony: "Most foundationally, marriage is the <em>doing</em> of God. And ultimately, marriage is the <em>display</em> of God. It displays the covenant-keeping love between Christ and his people to the world in a way that no other event or institution does. Marriage, therefore, is not mainly about being in love. It's mainly about telling the truth with our lives. And staying married is not about staying in love. It is about keeping covenant and putting the glory of Christ's covenant-keeping love on display."</p> <p><em>This Momentary Marriage</em> unpacks the biblical vision, its unexpected contours, and its weighty implications for married, single, divorced, and remarried alike.</p></p><p><p><strong>JOHN PIPER</strong> is pastor for preaching and vision at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis. His many books include <em>Sex and the Supremacy of Christ, Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, What Jesus Demands from the World,</em> and <em>Don't Waste Your Life</em>.</p><p>"Theologically, this book exalts human marriage as a metaphor for the ultimate love story in Christ. Practically, it applies that glorious vision of grace to our daily experiences in marriage, singleness, parenthood, and the most universal of human realities-sin. This book opens our eyes and guides our feet with the grace of Christ."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Raymond C. Ortlund Jr.</strong>, Lead Pastor, Immanuel Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><p>"This book is a treasure in an era when the common perspective on marriage has been more shaped by sitcoms and self-help books than by Scripture. Dr. Piper lifts our hearts and minds to God's vision for marriage. Embracing God's design and purposes for marriage can make our homes tastes of heaven."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Nancy Leigh DeMoss</strong>, author, <em>Biblical Womanhood in the Home</em>; radio host, <em>Revive Our Hearts</em></p><p>"This is not a 'how to' book on marriage. Instead, this is a 'why to' book. And that's what this culture desperately needs."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Dennis Rainey</strong><strong>,</strong> President, FamilyLife</p><p>"Miss the radical message of this book and you'll miss the joyful point of marriage. Heed the surprising call of this book and you'll appreciate the sacred privilege of marriage that our culture fails to see."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Larry Crabb, Jr.</strong>, Distinguished Scholar in Residence, Colorado Christian University</p><p>"A highly original contribution to Christian teaching on marriage. A copy should be put into the hands of every couple preparing for lasting and loving wedlock."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Charles Colson</strong>, founder, Prison Fellowship and the Colson Center for Christian Worldview</p><p>"This book grew out of John Piper's forty years of experience in marriage and many years of parenting, pastoring, and studying Scripture. It is filled with rich, practical wisdom about the nature of marriage as a wonderful but temporary gift from God. I have taught about marriage for over thirty years, and I still found much that I could learn from this book."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Wayne Grudem</strong>, Research Professor of Bible and Theology, Phoenix Seminary</p><p>"The reason this book is so delightful is that it sets marriage within the matrix of the Bible's fundamental themes: the glory of God, the outworking of justification, the relationship between this life and the life to come, how husbands and wives are to interact with each other this side of the cross, and much more of the same. This is not another little 'how to' book-yet if its God-centered and gospel-centered theology is genuinely absorbed, so many of the 'how to' questions will be robustly answered."<br>&#x2014;<strong>D. A. Carson</strong>, Research Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School</p><p>"John Piper's new book on marriage is an instant classic. It is at once biblical and devotional, the fruit of seasoned theological reflection and four decades of 'momentary' marriage."<br>&#x2014;<strong>Andreas J.

Color illustrations throughout.</p><p>Weaving in authentic details as seamlessly as Pa weaves the splints in his baskets, Ray (Mud; Pianna) pays homage not only to a time-honored craft, but to the way traditions link one generation to the next. A boy growing up in the hills above the Hudson Valley longs to accompany his father to town, where each month he takes his baskets to sell: "He always went when the moon was round, to have it for a lantern if he was late returning." As the seasons turn, the boy continues to watch and wait, listening to the stories Pa tells, observing the men at their basket weaving. Then after his ninth birthday, "I began to see Pa studying me the way he checked a basket when it was finished"; at the next full moon the boy is allowed to go to town. The journey opens the world to him, in more ways than one; the boy will never view his life the same way again. Ray's subtle symbolism and poetic language create a story that will linger with readers for many moons. And Cooney's (Ox-Cart Man) scenes are as pristine as the narrative. From countryside to bustling early- 20th-century metropolis, her deft brush picks out a few carefully chosen details to balance the ethereal simplicity of each scene: delicate fern fronds decorate the forest's undergrowth; a boy's red mittens counterpoint the muted grays of a winter scene; the iron filigree on a rooftop in town adds an elegant touch to the skyline. Author and artist unite in a tribute to the natural world humanity, and their abiding interconnectedness. Ages 4-8. (Sept.) <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 3 This engaging book tells about a young boy's coming-of-age in an isolated rural community around the turn of the last century, and about the special baskets made by the people who live in the hills above the Hudson River. For years, the child has been eager to join his father on his monthly walk to the nearby town to sell the baskets. Pa always goes at the time of the "basket moon" (the full moon) because he needs its light to find his way home. Finally, after the boy's ninth birthday, he accompanies his father to town. He is excited by all the new things he sees there, but when a townie taunts them with "A tisket, a tasket, hillbilly basket! That's all a bushwhacker knows," he is devastated. He wants nothing further to do with basket making and wants his family to stop, too. One of his father's helpers, seeing the boy's distress, helps him to understand the artistic nature of their craft, and to value such work. The story is told by the boy in lyrical prose, and is graced by Cooney's soft-hued oil-and-acrylic paintings. The artist makes the mountains and forests glow with a suffused light that enhances their beauty and softens the family's hard life, and she artistically incorporates the various steps of basket making described in the text. An afterword explains a little of the history of these baskets and the people who made them. A luminous and deeply satisfying look back in time.

Lancaster was born in Virginia. One of her aunts became Lady Astor, another the wife of artist Charles Dana Gibson (and a prototype of the Gibson Girl). After a brief marriage to a Marshall Field heir, she married Ronald Tree, a future Conservative member of Parliament, settled in England and turned her hand to interior decoration.

From East to West, to South and back again, a classic journey. Signet pb (�1957) published by the New American Library.</p><p><i>On The Road</i>, the most famous of Jack Kerouac's works, is not only the soul of the Beat movement and literature, but one of the most important novels of the century. Like nearly all of Kerouac's writing, <i>On The Road</i> is thinly fictionalized autobiography, filled with a cast made of Kerouac's real life friends, lovers, and fellow travelers. Narrated by Sal Paradise, one of Kerouac's alter-egos, <i>On the Road</i> is a cross-country bohemian odyssey that not only influenced writing in the years since its 1957 publication but penetrated into the deepest levels of American thought and culture.<p><strong>Jack Kerouac </strong>(1922-1969), father of the beat generation, was one of the most inventive writers of the twentieth century.

This new cloth edition of The Hero&#39;s Journey, published to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Campbell&#39;s birth, recounts his own quest and conveys the excitement of his lifelong exploration of our mythic traditions, what he called &#34;the one great story of mankind.&#34;</p><p>The man behind the myth is lovingly revealed in this collection of interviews with the late Joseph Campbell. Using Campbell's format for the "hero's journey," editor Phil Cousineau organized these interviews so that they reflect Campbell's own chronological life quest. He begins with "The Call to Adventure," in which Campbell speaks to his fascination with Native American myth as a child, and moves through "The Road of Trials" (his years in college and as a young professor at Sarah Lawrence) and the "Meeting with the Goddess" (referring to meeting his wife of 50 years, the modern dancer Jean Erdman). Since most of the book is written in a question and answer format (with a few excerpts from lectures), much of the text is in Campbell's own words. It is a feast for any fan to hear Campbell speak so personally about his own life while also imparting his usual insight and wisdom on every topic he discusses.<p> A few morsels of this feast can be found in the following tidbits: for example, readers may be surprised to discover that Campbell considered his half-mile track races in college to be the "peak" experiences of his life. (Campbell was an esteemed track star at Columbia University in the mid-1920s.) Or that it was the famous Paris-dweller and bookseller Sylvia Beach who helped Campbell understand the meaning behind <i>Ulysses</i> in 1928 and was influential in steering Campbell into the realm of mythology and heroes. Or that Campbell believed that his uncanny ability to relate myths to contemporary life came from teaching female students at Sarah Lawrence. "They always wanted the material to relate to themselves, to life," he explained to interviewer Stuart Brown. "I attribute the popular aspects of my writing to the training I got from these students." Or that <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> inspired numerous artists, including George Lucas of <i>Star Wars</i> fame and Richard Adams, author of <i>Watership Down</i>.</p><p> This is also a generously illustrated book, with numerous photos of Campbell, many of which are shown in their authentic sepia tones. Numerous full-color images of famous artwork and images speak to each mythological theme in the book, such as the "Death of Socrates" (Jacques Louis David, 1787) and the painting of "Sacred and Profane" (Titan, circa 1514). <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Joseph Campbell (1904-1987) is famous for bringing mythology to a mass audience. His best-known works are Hero with a Thousand Faces, The Masks of God, and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers.

Binding is tight.</p><p></p><h2>My Friend Leonard</h2><p>Perhaps the most unconventional and literally breathtaking father-son story you'll ever read, <b>My Friend Leonard</b> pulls you immediately and deeply into a relationship as unusual as it is inspiring.<br><br>The father figure is Leonard, the high-living, recovering coke addict "West Coast Director of a large Italian-American finance firm" (read: mobster) who helped to keep James Frey clean in <b>A Million Little Pieces</b>. The son is, of course, James, damaged perhaps beyond repair by years of crack and alcohol addiction-and by more than a few cruel tricks of fate.<br><br>James embarks on his post-rehab existence in Chicago emotionally devastated, broke, and afraid to get close to other people. But then Leonard comes back into his life, and everything changes. Leonard offers his "son" lucrative&#x2014;if illegal and slightly dangerous&#x2014;employment. He teaches James to enjoy life, sober, for the first time. He instructs him in the art of "living boldly," pushes him to pursue his passion for writing, and provides a watchful and supportive veil of protection under which James can get his life together. Both Leonard's and James's careers flourish...but then Leonard vanishes. When the reasons behind his mysterious absence are revealed, the book opens up in unexpected emotional ways.<br><br><b>My Friend Leonard</b> showcases a brilliant and energetic young writer rising to important new challenges&#x2014;displaying surprising warmth, humor, and maturity&#x2014;without losing his intensity. This book proves that one of the most provocative literary voices of his generation is also one of the most emphatically human.</p><p>In the bold and heartbreaking <i>My Friend Leonard</i>, James Frey picks up the story of his extraordinary life pretty much where things left off in his breakout bestseller and Amazon.com Best Book of 2003, <i>A Million Little Pieces</i>, the fierce, in-your-face memoir about Frey's kamikaze run of self-destruction and his days in rehab. Fresh from a stint in jail from pre-rehab-related charges ("On my first day in jail, a three hundred pound man named Porterhouse hit me in the back of the head with a metal tray."), clean-living Frey returns to Chicago and gets sucker-punched with a cruel blow that will leave readers ducking for cover in anticipation of the blinding bender that's sure to come. But then the titular Leonard, the larger-than-life Vegas mobster ("West Coast Director of a large Italian finance firm") whom James befriended in rehab, steps into the story and serves equal parts unlikely life coach, guardian angel, and father figure for the grief-stricken author, adopting him as his "son" and schooling him in the fine art of "living boldly": <p> </p><p> </p><blockquote>Be not bold, be f-cking BOLD. Every time you meet someone, make a f-cking impression. Make them think you're the hottest shit in the world. Make them think they're gonna lose their job if they don't give you one. Look 'em in the eye, and never look away. Be confident and calm, be f-cking bold.</blockquote><p> Hurricane Leonard storms into James's life, showering his young charge with multi-course feasts at steakhouses and Italian restaurants, courtside seats at Bulls' games, Cuban cigars, and an elaborate Super Bowl party in Los Angeles, all the while doling out wisdom on life and love and motivating James to stick to his burgeoning writing career. James even has a brief stint as an employee of Leonard's, though occupational hazards--like having a nine millimeter shoved in his face--prove too much for the novice bag man (though he does make enough to invest his earnings in a Picasso drawing). When Leonard drops out of sight for an extended period, his absence leaves readers aching to hear the familiar refrain of "My Son!" just one more time.</p><p> Frey sticks to the taut, staccato style that shot through <i>A Million Little Pieces</i> with such raw electricity. Surprisingly, the tone feels equally at home with this book's focus on friendship and extreme loyalty, and works to intensify the always-looming, adrenaline-rush threat of violence and the lure of the Fury that courses like a riptide throughout the book. Ultimately, it's a sense of hope, and humor even, that prevails and makes <i>My Friend Leonard</i> a stand-alone success. Despite his shady pedigree, you'll long to have a friend like Leonard just a phone call away. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i><br><br> </p> <p> <strong>James Frey's List of Books You Should Read</strong> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><table><tbody><tr> <td> <br><i>Paris Spleen</i></td><td> <br><i>Tropic of Cancer</i></td><td> <br><i>The Great Santini</i></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br> See more recommendations from James Frey<br> <p> <br><b>Amazon.com's Significant Seven</b><br><i>James Frey graciously agreed to answer the questions we like to ask every author: the Amazon.com Significant Seven.</i><br> </p><p><b>Q:</b> What book has had the most significant impact on your life?<br><b>A:</b> <i>Tao te Ching</i> by Lao Tsu.

Johannes Verne was soon to be rescued by outlaws, but no one could save him from the lasting memory of his grandfather&#39;s eyes, full of impenetrable hatred. Raised in part by Indians, then befriended by a mysterious woman, Johannes grew up to become a rugged adventurer and an educated man. But even now, strengthened by the love of a golden-haired girl and well on his way to making a fortune in bustling early-day Los Angeles, the past may rise up to threaten his future once more. And this time only the ancient gods of the desert can save him.</p><p><i>The Lonesome Gods</i> is Louis L'Amour's biggest and most important historical novel to date, a sweeping adventure of the California frontier. Here is the fascinating story of Johannes Verne, a young man left to die by his vengeful grandfather, rescued by outlaws and raised in part by the Indians of the desert. Strengthened by the love of two women -- Miss Nesselrode, whose mysterious past fires her ambitions for the future and Meghan, a willful young beauty -- Verne grows to become a rugged adventurer, a man strong enough to embrace the awesome power of the Palm Springs desert, and bold enough to stake a claim in the bustling world of opportunity that was early-day Los Angeles. <p>"Riveting reading." -- <i>The New Yorker</i>. </p><p>"This is L'Amour's finest book." -- <i>California Magazine</i></p>"Riveting reading." -- <i>The New Yorker</i>. <p>"This is L'Amour's finest book." -- <i>California Magazine</i></p></p><h2>Leaving Cold Sassy: The Unfinished Sequel to Cold Sassy Tree</h2><p>Fifteen chapters of an unfinished sequel to the best-selling novel Cold Sassy Tree are drawn to a conclusion by Burns&#39;s editor who also reflects on the inspiring life of Olive Ann Burns. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>"<i>Cold Sassy Tree</i>, Olive Ann Burns unforgettable story of a Georgia town at the turn of the century, has captivated millions of readers with its tale of Grandpa Blakeslee, his young bride Miss Love, and the irrepressible fiteen-year-old Will Tweedy. Throughout her long battle with cancer, Olive Ann Burns worked passionately on a sequel to this magical book. Only during her final days did she realize she wouldn't complete it, dictating from her hospital bed her wishes that the finished chapters be published.<p> The result is <i>Leaving Cold Sassy</i> - a portait of the grown-up Will Tweedy; of the feisty young schoolteacher who captures his heart; of the town that has claimed a place in the American imagination; and, in a fascinating reminiscence by her editor, of Olive Ann Burns, a writer who didn't get a chance to finish her extraordinary tale.</p><p> Complete with Olive Ann Burn's notes for later scenes and chapters exactly as she wrote them, <i>Leaving Cold Sassy</i> is a final, loving goodbye to Cold Sassy, Georgia.</p>In 1984, the late Burns (d. 1990) published Cold Sassy Tree--a spirited, southern small-town rural tale with robust characters and a regional period (1906) diction that was as tangy and real as grits. Now comes this partial sequel--which continues the story of Will Tweedy and the courting of his future wife--that Burns, with extraordinary courage, worked on through her final illness. Burns's editor, Katrina Kenison, who was left with notes and letters by the author to indicate plotlines beyond the 15 finished chapters here, has contributed a tribute and personal reminiscence. The previous novel concerned the adventures of narrator Will Tweedy, then 14, of Cold Sassy Tree, Georgia, who among others wondered at the shocking marriage of newly widowed Grandpa Blakeslee and the stylish Miss Love. Now, in 1917, Grandpa is gone, and boarding with Miss Love is that ``pure-T beauty,'' new schoolteacher Sanna Maria Klein, who's infatuated with a Harvard boy--until her disastrous visit to his fancy home when bath water floods a festive board. Will's courting moves on--even through a Thanksgiving when Sanna's usually genial foster-father, snookered on moonshine, saws a half moon out of the dining-room table to accommodate his massive stomach--but there are seeds of trouble even before the wedding: Will, a county agent for the state's Department of Agriculture, speaks of farming's gamble as ``excitin','' Sanna says, ``I hate excitement...just another word for worry.'' Meanwhile, most of the Cold Sassy Tree cast is here again: abrasive Aunt Loma, who can whistle ``Whispering Hope'' so thrillingly at church but who has crazy marriage plans, as well as a mean deal for her son; Will's parents, yoked but apart; and townsfolk who have the stubborn endurance of hardscrabble lives beyond their salty talk. For fans of Cold Sassy Tree, an essential; for newcomers, a spur to read the earlier novel. Kenison's tribute to Burns, a gentle, gallant woman, comprises half of the book.

She went to North London Collegiate School and studied journalism at University College, London. She then worked for ten years on various papers, including the Evening Standard. Her first publication was a book of poems, The Mountain Beast (1930), and her first novel, Cold Comfort Farm (1932), won the Femina Vie Heureuse Prize. Amongst her other novels are Miss Linsey and Pa (1936), Nightingale Wood (1938), Westwood (1946), Conference at Cold Comfort Farm (1949) and Beside the Pearly Water (1954). Stella Gibbons died in 1989.Narrator Anna Massey has her work cut out for her as she takes on the eccentric Starr family of Cold Comfort Farm. Massey conveys humor and even a touch of suspense. The sights, sounds, even the smells of the farm are evoked amid the minutia of Gibbons&#39;s details. The very sounds of the words have as much effect as the tale they tell. Gibbons&#39;s use of melodrama popular in the early 1900&#39;s, to tell a romantic tale while simultaneously satirizing the genre, makes Massey&#39;s job more challenging. She manages quite well. The resurrection of the farm from brooding ineffectuality to normal human activity is worth listening to over and over. D.P.D.

In another, your creators are a species of dim-witted creatures who built us to figure out what they could not. In a different version of the afterlife you work as a background character in other people&#x2019;s dreams. Or you may find that God is a married couple struggling with discontent, or that the afterlife contains only those people whom you remember, or that the hereafter includes the thousands of previous gods who no longer attract followers. In some afterlives you are split into your different ages; in some you are forced to live with annoying versions of yourself that represent what you could have been; in others you are re-created from your credit card records and Internet history. David Eagleman proposes many versions of our purpose here; we are mobile robots for cosmic mapmakers, we are reunions for a scattered confederacy of atoms, we are experimental subjects for gods trying to understand what makes couples stick together.<br><br>These wonderfully imagined tale&#x2013;at once funny, wistful, and unsettling&#x2013;are rooted in science and romance and awe at our mysterious existence: a mixture of death, hope, computers, immortality, love, biology, and desire that exposes radiant new facets of our humanity.</p><p><b>DAVID EAGLEMAN</b> grew up in New Mexico. As an undergraduate he majored in British and American Literature before earning his PhD in Neuroscience. He heads the Laboratory for Perception and Action at Baylor College of Medicine, and is founder and director of the Initiative on Neuroscience and Law. At night he writes fiction.<i>Sum </i><br><br>In the afterlife you relive all your experiences, but this time with the events reshuffled into a new order: all the moments that share a quality are grouped together.<br><br>You spend two months driving the street in front of your house, seven months having sex. You sleep for thirty years without opening your eyes. For five months straight you flip through magazines while sitting on a toilet.<br><br>You take all your pain at once, all twenty-seven intense hours of it. Bones break, cars crash, skin is cut, babies are born. Once you make it through, it&#x2019;s agony-free for the rest of your afterlife.<br><br>But that doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s always pleasant. You spend six days clipping your nails. Fifteen months looking for lost items. Eighteen months waiting in<br>line. Two years of boredom: staring out a bus window, sitting in an airport terminal. One year reading books. Your eyes hurt, and you itch, because you can&#x2019;t take a shower until it&#x2019;s your time to take your marathon two-hundred-day shower. Two weeks wondering what happens when you die. One minute realizing your body is falling. Seventy-seven hours of confusion. One hour realizing you&#x2019;ve forgotten someone&#x2019;s name. Three weeks realizing you are wrong. Two days lying. Six weeks waiting for a green light. Seven hours vomiting. Fourteen minutes experiencing pure joy. Three months doing laundry. Fifteen hours writing your signature. Two days tying shoelaces. Sixty-seven days of heartbreak. Five weeks driving lost. Three days calculating restaurant tips. Fifty-one days deciding what to wear. Nine days pretending you know what is being talked about. Two weeks counting money. Eighteen days staring into the refrigerator. Thirty-four days longing. Six months watching commercials. Four weeks sitting in thought, wondering if there is something better you could be doing with your time. Three years swallowing food. Five days working buttons and zippers. Four minutes wondering what your life would be like if you reshuffled the order of events. In this part of the afterlife, you imagine something analogous to your Earthly life, and the thought is blissful: a life where episodes are split into tiny swallowable pieces, where moments do not endure, where one experiences the joy of jumping from one event to the next like a child hopping from spot to spot on the burning sand.<br><i>Egalitaire</i><br><br>In the afterlife you discover that God understands the complexities of life. She had originally submitted to peer pressure when She structured Her universe like all the other gods had, with a binary categorization of people into good and evil. But it didn&#x2019;t take long for Her to realize that humans could be good in many ways and simultaneously corrupt and meanspirited in other ways. How was She to arbitrate who goes to Heaven and who to Hell? Might not it be possible, She considered, that a man could be an embezzler and still give to charitable causes? Might not a woman be an adulteress but bring pleasure and security to two men&#x2019;s lives? Might not a child unwittingly divulge secrets that splinter a family? Dividing the population into two categories&#x2014;good and bad&#x2014;seemed like a more reasonable task when She was younger, but with experience these decisions became more difficult. She composed complex formulas to weigh hundreds of factors, and ran computer programs that rolled out long strips of paper with eternal decisions. But Her sensitivities revolted at this automation&#x2014;and when the computer generated a decision She disagreed with, She took the opportunity to kick out the plug in rage. That afternoon She listened to the grievances of the dead from two warring nations. Both sides had suffered, both sides had legitimate grievances, both pled their cases earnestly. She covered Her ears and moaned in misery. She knew Her humans were multidimensional, and She could no longer live under the rigid architecture of Her youthful choices.<br><br>Not all gods suffer over this; we can consider ourselves lucky that in death we answer to a God with deep sensitivity to the byzantine hearts of Her creations. For months She moped around Her living room in Heaven, head drooped like a bulrush, while the lines piled up. Her advisors advised Her to delegate the decision making, but She loved Her humans too much to leave them to the care of anyone else.<br><br>In a moment of desperation the thought crossed Her mind to let everyone wait on line indefinitely, letting them work it out on their own. But then a better idea struck Her generous spirit. She could afford it: She would grant everyone, every last human, a place in Heaven. After all, everyone had something good inside; it was part of the design specifications. Her new plan brought back the bounce to Her gait, returned the color to Her cheeks. She shut down the operations in Hell, fired the Devil, and brought every last human to be by Her side in Heaven. Newcomers or old-timers, nefarious or righteous: under the new system, everyone gets equal time to speak with Her. Most people find Her a little garrulous and oversolicitous, but She cannot be accused of not caring.<br><br>The most important aspect of Her new system is that everyone is treated equally. There is no longer fire for some and harp music for others. The afterlife is no longer defined by cots versus waterbeds, raw potatoes versus sushi, hot water versus champagne. Everyone is a brother to all, and for the first time an idea has been realized that never came to fruition on Earth: true equality.<br><br>The Communists are baffled and irritated, because they have finally achieved their perfect society, but only by the help of a God in whom they don&#x2019;t want to believe. The meritocrats are abashed that they&#x2019;re stuck for eternity in an incentiveless system with a bunch of pinkos. The conservatives have no penniless to disparage; the liberals have no downtrodden to promote.<br><br>So God sits on the edge of Her bed and weeps at night, because the only thing everyone can agree upon is that they&#x2019;re all in Hell.<br><i>Circle of Friends</i><br><br>When you die, you feel as though there were some subtle change, but everything looks approximately the same. You get up and brush your teeth. You kiss your spouse and kids and leave for the office. There is less traffic than normal. The rest of your building seems less full, as though it&#x2019;s a holiday. But everyone in your office is here, and they greet you kindly. You feel strangely popular. Everyone you run into is someone you know. At some point, it dawns on you that this is the afterlife: the world is only made up of people you&#x2019;ve met before.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a small fraction of the world population&#x2014;about 0.00002 percent&#x2014;but it seems like plenty to you.<br><br>It turns out that only the people you remember are here. So the woman with whom you shared a glance in the elevator may or may not be included. Your second-grade teacher is here, with most of the class. Your parents, your cousins, and your spectrum of friends through the years. All your old lovers. Your boss, your grandmothers, and the waitress who served your food each day at lunch. Those you dated, those you almost dated, those you longed for. It is a blissful opportunity to spend quality time with your one thousand connections, to renew fading ties, to catch up with those you let slip away.<br><br>It is only after several weeks of this that you begin to feel forlorn. You wonder what&#x2019;s different as you saunter through the vast quiet parks with a friend or two. No strangers grace the empty park benches. No family unknown to you throws bread crumbs for the ducks and makes you smile because of their laughter.<br><br>As you step into the street, you note there are no crowds, no buildings teeming with workers, no distant cities bustling, no hospitals running 24/7 with patients dying and staff rushing, no trains howling into the night with sardined passengers on their way home. Very few foreigners. You begin to consider all the things unfamiliar to you. You&#x2019;ve never known, you realize, how to vulcanize rubber to make a tire. And now those factories stand empty. You&#x2019;ve never known how to fashion a silicon chip from beach sand, how to launch rockets out of the atmosphere, how to pit olives or lay railroad tracks. And now those industries are shut down.<br><br>The missing crowds make you lonely.You begin to complain about all the people you could be meeting. But no one listens or sympathizes with you, because this is precisely what you chose when you were alive.<br><i>Descent of Specie</i>s<br><br>In the afterlife, you are treated to a generous opportunity: you can choose whatever you would like to be in the next life. Would you like to be a member of the opposite sex? Born into royalty? A philosopher with bottomless profundity? A soldier facing triumphant battles?<br><br>But perhaps you&#x2019;ve just returned here from a hard life. Perhaps you were tortured by the enormity of the decisions and responsibilities that surrounded you, and now there&#x2019;s only one thing you yearn for: simplicity. That&#x2019;s permissible. So for the next round, you choose to be a horse. You covet the bliss of that simple life: afternoons of grazing in grassy fields, the handsome angles of your skeleton and the prominence of your muscles, the peace of the slow-flicking tail or the steam rifling through your nostrils as you lope across snow-blanketed plains.<br><br>You announce your decision. Incantations are muttered, a wand is waved, and your body begins to metamorphose into a horse. Your muscles start to bulge; a mat of strong hair erupts to cover you like a comfortable blanket in winter. The thickening and lengthening of your neck immediately feels normal as it comes about. Your carotid arteries grow in diameter, your fingers blend hoofward, your knees stiffen, your hips strengthen, and meanwhile, as your skull lengthens into its new shape, your brain races in its changes: your cortex retreats as your cerebellum grows, the homunculus melts man to horse, neurons redirect, synapses unplu...</p><h2>The Expositor&#39;s New Testament, Counselor&#39;s Edition</h2><p>King James Version of the New Testament, modified by Jimmy Swaggart for easier reading.

He lives in Oakland, California.<br>[Here is a whole section from Chapter Two. In the book, it is accompanied by seven line drawings.] <p>Installations </p><p>In American homes, multiscreen shoji installations are usually located in areas otherwise occupied by curtains, drapes, and blinds (that is, in front of windows and patio doors), in pass-throughs connecting rooms within the home, or in front of closets and other storage areas. A screen less than 24" wide looks cramped and is too narrow to be practical as a doorway; in a multiscreen installation it would require you to move more than one screen each time you wanted to pass through. Beyond 40", a screen can become too heavy to support its own weight without some kind of structural reinforcement like enlarged rails at top and bottom. Three parallel tracks for sliding the shoji is plenty for most installations, although you can use more if the opening is deep enough. You need 1/8" to 1/4" clearance between screens in their tracks. </p><p>Types of Shoji Installations </p><p>There are many different ways to install shoji in your home. When designing your shoji, think carefully about traffic patterns and who will be opening and closing the screens. Remember that being able to move the shoji gives you control over light and view. Design your screens to maximize both. </p><p>1. Sliding. This is the traditional Japanese method. The rails of the shoji are rabeted to form ridges that fit into tracks (dados) at top and bottom. Rabeting enables the screens to have a minimum of passing clearance without reducing the amount of wood between the dados. The lower track groove is shallower (1/8" is enough) than the top and supports the entire weight of the screen as it moves. The upper track groove, at least twice the depth of the lower to allow easy removal, serves only to keep the screen vertical. Because the entire screen is supported from below, and not from the side as with a Western-style hinged door, the frame needs only a minimum of structural reinforcement. <br>A modern alternative to this sliding mode calls for a wheel in a housing to be mortised into the bottom rail of the shoji. The groove in the wheel runs on a metal track that is mounted on the floor or threshold. An omnidirectional caster can also be used in an inlaid hardwood track. The rolling action of the wheel or caster eliminates the friction of wood-to-wood contact in the bottom track. Such an installation is suited to very large panels and to panels that contain glass, thick plastic sheeting, or other heavy materials. It also works well in high-traffic areas where the screens have to operate quickly. The top is a simple tenon/rabet and dado. <br> 2. Hanging. With most sliding screens, the tops of the bottom tracks are made level with the flooring so that people don't trip as they pass through the opening. If the screens are added later or are installed in a carpeted area, it may not be possible to inlay the tracks. Instead, the screens can be fitted with a roller device at the top and suspended from an upper track. </p><p>Most hardware stores stock a variety of tracking devices and guides that help prevent the screens from swinging as they move. Many systems use adjusting screws to make the screens plumb. Unfortunately, these devices are often unattractive. Hide them from sight by a valance or other device (see part 4). Rollers and other mechanical devices can also be quite noisy, and this might destroy the tranquil mood you have labored to create with the shoji in the first place. </p><p>3. Bifold (hinged). Although hinges are rarely used with shoji in Japan, they make sense in many American homes. Used with a swivel roller at the top of the screen, hinges allow several screens to operate in a single track, making installation possible in long but shallow openings. Because the screens are stored perpendicular to the track, edge-on to the viewer, the opening is obscured much less than with conventional sliding panels. Unlike sliding screens, hinged screens have a tendency to sag and may need to be stabilized along the diagonal with hipboards or thickened rails. <br> 4. Freestanding. Single screens are often used as partial, stationary partitions without tracking systems. They can rest in a stand that can be moved about the room, or they can be attached to a wall, floor, or ceiling. Two or more screens can also be attached at their sides and arranged in a zigzag to make them stand on their own. Since the weight of each screen rests on the bottom, lateral shear here is not a structural concern as it is with hinged screens. Freestanding screens have a decorative, sculptural value and make versatile room dividers that give privacy without cutting off light or closing you in. See part 4 for examples.</p></p><h2>The Harm Done By Religion Free Inquiry</h2><p>The third in a series, this new anthology collects outstanding articles from the prior decade of Free Inquiry.

Thousands of birders visit the country each year to enjoy Belize's amazing abundance and variety of both temperate and tropical birds in natural habitats that remain largely unspoiled. But until now, despite the growing need for an authoritative identification guide, birders have had to rely on regional field guides that offer only limited information on Belizean birds.</p><p>Birds of Belize provides the first complete guide to the identification of all currently known species&#x2014;574 in all. The birds are grouped by families, with an introduction to each family that highlights its uniquely identifying characteristics and behaviors. The species accounts include all the details necessary for field identification: scientific and common names, size, plumage features, thorough voice descriptions, habitat, distribution, and status in Belize. Full color, expertly drawn illustrations by noted bird artist Dana Gardner present male and female, juvenile and adult, and basic and alternate plumages to aid visual identification throughout the year, while 234 range maps show the birds' distribution and seasonality in Belize.

Now he presents a whole new perspective on life as he leads us into the brave new world of the assisted-living facility. Charming, sarcastic, despairing, flip, taciturn, erudite, and altogether wonderful--with a razor sharp wit and a knack for turning a phrase--Mr. Gould is an American original and a perfect tour guide. Whether he&#39;s complaining to management about his apartment windows that don&#39;t open or socializing with the other &#34;inmates&#34; at happy hour; whether wondering why they put a napkin over the stone-cold bread at dinner or taking comfort in the memories (&#34;making do with the reruns&#34;) of his loving and eccentric collection of old friends and colleagues from Maine, Mr. Gould proves that you can write a funny book about a serious subject, namely, how we treat our elderly.</p><p>ONCE UPON a long-ago time, I was a fine-looking young man with fire in my eye, zeal in my heart, and a haircut that cost twenty-five cents." So begins Tales from Rhapsody Home, ninety-two-years-old John Gould's entertaining look at how he arrived, quite suddenly, at old age and found himself living in a retirement community. With razor-sharp wit and comic sensibility, Mr. Gould offers advice and guidance to those of us ready or not quite ready for the "comforts" of assisted living.<p> Rhapsody Home is a mythical name, but the place is real-John Gould and his wife, Dorothy, have been living there for the past four and a half years. Mr. Gould, the author of dozens of books about life in small-town Maine, turns his critical eye toward a different kind of small town. And he captures perfectly the absurd rules and quaint idiosyncrasies of this brave new world. Whether he's complaining to management about his windows that don't open or swapping tales at happy hour with Mr. Reynolds about his gas and her hernia, whether he's wondering why they put a napkin over the stone-cold bread at dinner or taking comfort from memories of his loving and eccentric collection of old friends and colleagues, Mr. Gould is by turns sarcastic, charming, taciturn, erudite, hilarious, and wicked-but he is always altogether wonderful. John Gould is an American original. The rest of us can only hope that when it's our turn to check into a Rhapsody Home, we're lucky enough to have a neighbor like him.</p><p></p>FEISTY AS EVER.<p> Dear Reader, <i>Tales From Rhapsody Home</i> is this defiant old geezer's effort to help young and not so young folks prepare to become residents in a retirement home. My wife, Dorothy, and I are living in just such a place, and I'm happy to pass along some of what we have learned: How to order a jelly omelet after five meals of beef; how to distribute color photos of your spleen operation without making the others jealous; and more. Rhapsody Home is a mythical name, but everything I write is true. Because of the nature of this book, I feel it's best we keep our exact whereabouts unknown. -John Gould</p><p> A while ago, John wrote me a note from his residence, aka Rhapsody Home. The note said that the cook had quit because he couldn't stand the food.Now everyone can share John's wisdom and humor as he settles into an assisted living community. Feisty as ever, he's no more adjusted to the place that when he first arrived. This book gives us all something to ponder as we approach our Golden Years and wonder what we're going to do with them." -Leon Gorman President, L.L. BEAN </p><p></p></p><h2>Oil! (California Fiction)</h2><p>In <i>Oil!</i> Upton Sinclair fashioned a novel out of the oil scandals of the Harding administration, providing in the process a detailed picture of the development of the oil industry in Southern California. Bribery of public officials, class warfare, and international rivalry over oil production are the context for Sinclair's story of a genial independent oil developer and his son, whose sympathy with the oilfield workers and socialist organizers fuels a running debate with his father. Senators, small investors, oil magnates, a Hollywood film star, and a crusading evangelist people the pages of this lively novel.</p><p><b>Upton Sinclair</b> (1878-1968), novelist and journalist, is best known for his novel about the Chicago meatpacking industry, <i>The Jungle</i>.

He is Professor of History at San Francisco State University.Author Upton Sinclair&#39;s remarkable early-twentieth-century epic tells the story of Southern California&#39;s cut-throat oil industry, and the lengths that some folks would go to enjoy success. Hard-pressed to outperform actor Daniel Day Lewis&#39;s Oscar-winning performance in the feature film adaptation, narrator Grover Gardner plays it straight in a solid and believable performance that will engage listeners with its simplicity and earnestness. Though there aren&#39;t many dramatic shifts in tone or accent, the sea of characters that floods this story is realistic from first to last. This is perhaps an even more remarkable feat considering the length of the production. Through thick and thin, Gardner never fails to deliver with passion and vigor.

Admitting you have a problem is the first stop on the high-functioning express: If you don&#x2019;t own it, you can&#x2019;t fix it. So before you do anything else, make this declaration, be it on paper, in front of the mirror, or as a mantra you repeat to yourself.<br>2. IDENTIFY YOUR PROBLEM.<br><br>Before you can begin to change your behavior, you must know what it is you&#x2019;re changing. We&#x2019;ve isolated many common problems in this chapter; one or several may be yours.<br>3. HOW IS YOUR BEHAVIOR AFFECTING YOUR LIFE?<br><br>How do we know when our maladaptive behaviors have crossed the line? We often don&#x2019;t. And we usually have a well-worn list of excuses for how they haven&#x2019;t. We&#x2019;ve included a questionnaire in this chapter that will tell you if your &#x201c;issues&#x201d; have grown to unacceptable proportions. If you&#x2019;re reading this, we&#x2019;re guessing they have.<br>4. ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE TIME FOR CHANGE IS NOW. The time has come to commit to a better way of living. &#x201c;Soon&#x201d; is not a time. &#x201c;After Thanksgiving&#x201d; is not a time. &#x201c;After I&#x2019;ve finished my exams&#x201d; is not a time. Now is a time. Look at your watch. Write down what time it is. Write down the date. This is the moment your new life has begun.<br>We are all human, thus we all make mistakes. Many of us make the same mistakes over and over and over again. In fact, we seldom make new ones because bad habits are just the repetition of mistakes, be they conscious or unconscious. Addiction enters our lives when we let the momentary pleasure or pain avoidance of those habits hijack our critical thinking and affect our behavior in ways that are either life threatening or life limiting. &#x201c;Addiction,&#x201d; &#x201c;bad habits,&#x201d; &#x201c;poor life choices&#x201d;&#x2014;call them what you will: They all fall under the heading of &#x201c;Lack of Impulse Control.&#x201d;</p><p>Do you talk about something you never get around to doing? Do you make grandiose, life-changing plans you never end up realizing? Do you find yourself saying, &#x201c;This is my last [fill in the blank]&#x201d;: My last cheeseburger. My last affair with a married man. My last charge on my already overused credit cards. My last lie to Mom, Dad, myself. The last time I do not do what I promise myself I will.&nbsp; &#x201c;Tomorrow I start over.&#x201d; &#x201c;New leaf.&#x201d; &#x201c;Never again.&#x201d; &#x201c;One more time and that&#x2019;s it.&#x201d; Are you a member of the &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll start tomorrow&#x201d; club but tomorrow never comes? Are you easily derailed by the opinion of others? Does your own fear-based thinking hold you back? Does the idea of staying where you are, no matter how uncomfortable, make you feel safer than moving toward something that might actually make you happy? Are you ignoring any signs of danger ahead?</p><p>The advantage (if you can call it that) that addicts have is that they have their identifiable addictions. Whether you are an alcoholic, a drug addict, a compulsive gambler, or an uncontrollable overeater, you know what you are fighting. But if you are a woman who makes poor love choices, a serial philanderer, someone who sabotages friendships in the workplace by gossiping, someone whose go-to emotion is fear, or someone whose neediness drives people away, there is a good chance you have remained blissfully unaware of your addiction until significant damage has been done. The saddest wake-up call of all is the news that your actions have brought damaging turbulence into your daily life and more often than not the lives of others. Most likely, none of you are lacking for concerned friends or family members who are more than willing to act as human billboards reminding you of where you fall short. You screw up, the wife points out why, you turn to her with a look of intense gratitude and say, &#x201c;Thank God you were there, Cindy. I never noticed. THAT won&#x2019;t happen again!&#x201d; Meanwhile, back in real life, we know that seldom happens. More often than not, the repeated complaints of partners, lovers, and friends only drive us deeper into our cave of &#x201c;Honor thy cravings; screw the rest of the world.&#x201d; Addiction is a powerful foe.</p><p><br>� � �</p><p><br><br>So it may be an unwelcome revelation, but awakening to the fact that the fly in the ointment is&nbsp;you&nbsp;is the beginning of change. The truth is at your door, and with it, the possibility of a new beginning.</p><p><br>PAUL<br><br>In the world of recovery, &#x201c;First things first&#x201d; has become something of a holy commandment. There&#x2019;s a reason such statements become bumper stickers. They&#x2019;re necessary elements to a proper beginning.</p><p>Addiction is in fact a primary disease, meaning it is not a symptom of another disorder. It must be dealt with before any of life&#x2019;s other challenges can be met. Whatever your personal disorder or dysfunction may be, if you are beginning your own path of recovery, the same sense of priorities will serve you best. Deal with your problem. There&#x2019;s no time like the present.<br><br></p><p><br>So what does it take to get us to walk away from stagnant, chronic, destructive behavior? A &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t work now; never really did&#x201d; pattern that has become a habit?<br>If you&#x2019;re not doing a single thing but reading this chapter, then you&#x2019;re already taking a positive step. That&#x2019;s because change begins with the will to change, and finding the will to change is a major triumph. Drug addicts become sick and tired of being sick and tired. Sometimes that&#x2019;s enough: the reality of change or die. For the non&#x2013;life-threatening but life-limiting conditions, the stakes may be smaller but the rewards of change are large. Just the commitment to change, followed by those first attempts at a more constructive behavior, can be comforting. You&#x2019;ll be energized by the thought of a new and better life, one that is free of the daily &#x201c;Oh, no! Not again!&#x201d; moments after vowing to fix things &#x201c;this time.&#x201d; So that said, let&#x2019;s get started.</p><p><br>TRACEY<br><br>In society, we are encouraged to hide our problems and cover up our shame. In the world of recovery, people are applauded for owning their failures.</p><p><br><br><b>Identify Your Problem</b><br>If one gathered together twenty-five random people and made them all stand up and talk about the problems in their lives, every one of them would have made a bad love choice, sabotaged an opportunity, hurt someone while defending their own position, or worried about not being able to control their weight, their temper, their lust for the girl or boy next door. We all have a laundry list of things we have done or continue to do that we are ashamed of and would like to change.</p><p>But before you can change anything, especially something that is most likely harbored in your subconscious, you have to be able to identify it.

An angry farmer ran up to the car, looked in the backseat, and upon seeing two frightened children screamed, &#x201c;What the hell is wrong with you? You&#x2019;re drunk! You&#x2019;re going to kill yourself and those kids someday!&#x201d; He was absolutely right, and I suspect my father knew it. Four months later he was dead. He died alone when he drove that car directly into the abutment of a bridge.</p><p>Thirty-five years later I was doing the same thing: driving loaded with my two beautiful children in the backseat of my car. Why do bright, well-educated, and civilized men and women ignore such dark truths and continue on paths of self-destruction?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this point you may be saying, &#x201c;Hey, wait a minute, I&#x2019;m not a drug addict. I keep my booze to a minimum. I would never drive drunk. I make everyone wear a seat belt. I pay the rent on time. Keep gas in the car. Walk through the mall looking and acting like everyone else. I&#x2019;m a version of fine.&#x201d; Then one might ask why you picked up this book. Something must be gnawing on the wires of your psyche. Something must feel out of place in your world.</p><p>There is a lot of information in the promise of this book:&nbsp;Recovery is not just for addicts.&nbsp;You might not have a drug habit, but addiction comes in many forms. It&#x2019;s what takes your mind off of the real issues. It&#x2019;s what keeps you focused on something else instead of the underlying problems. The guy you are stuck on who never follows through&#x2014;it&#x2019;s easy to get mad at him, be on and off with him, rage at him or cry over him. But if you look at your life, was there anyone else who behaved in the same way? Maybe Dad? Are you addicted to the patterns of push-me/pull-you? Is your understanding of interaction with the opposite sex all about confrontation and disappointment? Is the controlling dynamic of your relationships anger, rejection, and conflict? Do things not feel right unless they present wrong?</p><p>Addiction doesn&#x2019;t necessarily imply there are substances involved. Addiction to feelings is a powerful force. Addiction to feeling inadequate, addiction to feeling superior, addiction to feeling like you are always letting people down, addiction to feeling like you will never be the person you want to be, addiction to your excuses for why things don&#x2019;t work out. &#x201c;If I lost twenty pounds, my life would be better. I would have a better job, a better love life, a better apartment. People might like me more.&#x201d; &#x201c;So,&#x201d; one could ask, &#x201c;if you really feel that way, what is keeping you from just cutting back on what you consume and getting out there and moving around? Or are you so addicted to the temporary comfort that food provides that it becomes more important than the guilt and remorse about overconsumption it leaves behind?&#x201d;</p><p>Also, never underestimate the power of habit. Habits keep us tethered to something even if that something is not good for us&#x2014;even if that something is in fact keeping us from what we really want. The reliability of a connection so powerful and long-standing somehow feels safe in a twisted way.</p><p>One of the big barriers to repairing our problems is that we are terrified of what our life will look and feel like without this &#x201c;thing&#x201d; we have become so used to. The thing can be booze, it can be heroin, it can be sugar and fried food, it can be constantly having something to complain about, it can be anything we glom on to that...</p></p><h2>A New Beginning II : A Personal Handbook to Enhance Your Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness</h2><p>This is an uplifting book that strikes a chord with the very core of your being. Written by Abraham-Hicks to assist you in understanding the absolute connection between your physical self and your inner self, Abraham puts this physical life experience into perspective as they explain and define who we really are and why we have come forth as physical beings. This book is filled with processes and examples to assist you in making a deliberate conscious connection with your own Inner Being, that you might find the awesome satisfaction with this physical life experience that can only come once this connection is made. <p>A New Beginning II contains uplifting new material from Abraham including Law of Attraction, Law of Allowing, and the effective use of your Guidance System. Includes questions and answers from live workshops, affirmations, and powerful processes for increasing your ability to intentionally create whatever you want. </p><p>Like the book before it, A NEW BEGINNING II is clear, practical, inspiring and empowering with more focus on how to realign with your Inner Being. The bottom line for Abraham-Hicks is to choose to feel good in every moment. From that base of joy you will naturally and easily create what you want for yourself and the world.</p></p><p>Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from abraham, Jerry and Esther Hicks began, in 1986, disclosing their Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates. Then, recognizing the practical results being received by those persons who began plying Abraham with meaningful personal questions regarding their finances, bodily conditions, and relationships...the Hickses made a conscious decision to allow Abrahams teachings to become available to an ever widening circle of seekers. And that circle continues to expand even as you read this page. <p>Jerry and Esther have now published more than 380 Abraham-Hicks books, cassettes and videos, and have been presenting open group interactive workshops in as many as 59 cities a year to those who gather to participate in this progressive stream of thought. </p><p>Although worldwide attention has been given by leading edge thinkers to this "Science of Deliberate Creation" who, in turn, incorporate many of Abrahams concepts into their books, lectures, sermons, screenplays and scripts, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person as individuals begin to discover the value of these materials in their practical, personal experience. </p><p>Abraham, a group of obviously evolved teachers, speak their broader Nonphysical perspective through the physical apparatus of Esther. Speaking to our level of comprehension, from their present moment to our now, through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant yet comprehensively simple, recordings in print and in sound they guide us to a clear connection with our Inner Being they guide us to self-upliftment from our Total Self.</p></p><h2>The All New Fannie Farmer Boston Cooking School Cookbook Tenth Edition, Gift Edition, Complete and Unabridged</h2><p>Stated Gift Edition on Spine of this Bantam Book.

The passing to a new generation of the literary flame--albeit, in this instance, a blowtorch." In a firestorm of controversy, <i>l'affaire Houellebecq</i> has spread throughout Europe and beyond, with translations of the book undertaken in nearly thirty countries around the world.<br><br>The central characters, Bruno and Michel, were born to a bohemian mother (but they had different fathers, of course) at the height of the sixties. Following her inevitable divorce, they endured separate childhoods and developed distinct identities. Bruno--a failure to his own family and literary calling--is pursued by sexual obsession and madness. Michel--a wholly asexual molecular biologist--expresses his disgust with society by engineering one that frees mankind at last from its uncontrollable, destructive urges.<br><br>An international phenomenon, <b>The Elementary Particles</b> is a furiously important novel.</p><p>Bruno and Michel are half-brothers, born to a hippie mother who believed in following her bliss. As boys they live in ignorance of each other--at one point attending the same school without knowing of their blood connection. As grown men they're not truly close, but they occasionally phone each other late at night. Bruno's a hopeless sexual obsessive, often drunk or on his way there, and Michel's a molecular biologist, distant and inaccessible.<p> Michel Houellebecq's <i>The Elementary Particles</i> follows these brothers through the latter half of the 20th century. Bruno and Michel are buffeted by history, vessels of disappointment and desire rocked by the ocean of time. Shuttled away to a boarding school where he's sexually abused by other boys, Bruno grows up full of twisted sexual longings and a contempt for aging women so palpable that at times it's stomach-churning. At a commune in the country, Bruno takes stock: </p><blockquote> The women were intolerable at breakfast, but by cocktail hour the mystical tarts were hopelessly vying with younger women once again. Death is the great leveler. On Wednesday afternoon he met Catherine, a fifty-year-old who had been a feminist of the old school. She was tanned, with dark curly hair; she must have been very attractive when she was twenty. Her breasts were still in good shape, he thought when he saw her by the pool, but she had a fat ass. </blockquote> Michel doesn't hate women; he doesn't even notice them. Instead of leering at bodies by the pool, he stares at particles in microscopes. He wins prizes for his experiments, but never experiences the rush of life. For both men, the damage has been done by history, by mother, before the story begins. What interests Houellebecq are the permutations and recapitulations of damage--the way the particles of the self can never be completely reconstituted. <i>--Emily White</i>"An original work of art&#x2013;ironic, intelligent and as airtight and elegant as a geometry proof."<br>--<i>The New York Times Magazine<br><br></i>"[A] brilliant novel of ideas...

Its captain, E.M. DeHaan, is recruited by Dutch Naval Intelligence to smuggle arms and spies past the watchful eyes of the German Navy. Like most of Furst's protagonists, DeHaan is at first a reluctant hero, certain that disguising the Noordendam as a Spanish freighter flying the flag of a neutral nation that won't attract the attention of the Nazi authorities will never work. The plot takes DeHaan, his crew and a handful of passengers that include a refugee family, a beautiful woman, and a mysterious Russian through the dangerous waters of the Mediterranean, the North Sea, and the Baltic. Putting DeHaan ashore in the exotic port cities affords Furst an opportunity to evoke the sights, smells and atmosphere of Alexandria's waterfront alleys, Lisbon's intrigue-filled cafes, and Tangier's shadowy souks, which he does with consummate skill. Maintaining a measured but never lagging pace, Furst takes the Noordendam on its final dangerous voyage past the Baltic Fleet in a tour de force by a writer who's inherited the mantle of Eric Ambler and Graham Greene and wears it as if it had been custom tailored for him. <i>--Jane Adams</i>ALAN FURST is widely recognized as the master of the historical spy novel.

Readers new to securities will find it an excellent primer, one that relies on time-honored indicators such as quarterly earnings, market capitalization, and daily indexes. O'Neil's study of winning stocks stretches back to the 1960s, and he shares his insights here, describing what characterizes a growth stock, when to cut your losses (at 7 or 8 percent, no more), and how to spot a market top.<p> The techniques in <i>How to Make Money in Stocks</i> are hardly revolutionary, but therein lies their strength, as O'Neil claims his is "a winning system in good times or bad." Investors interested in Net stocks might be disappointed--the author's first rule is that a company must show a pattern of growing profits, which disqualifies many dot coms.

In 1966, only the merest rumblings of political upheaval disturbed the gracious life of the author, widow of the manager of Shell Petroleum in China. As the rumblings fast became a cataclysm, Cheng found herself a target of the revolution: Red Guards looted her home, literally grinding underfoot her antique porcelain and jade treasures; and she was summarily imprisoned, falsely accused of espionage. Despite harsh privationeven tortureshe refused to confess and was kept in solitary confinement for over six years, suffering deteriorating health and mounting anxiety about the fate of her only child, Meiping. When the political climate softened, and she was released, Cheng learned that her fears were justified: Meiping had been beaten to death when she refused to denounce her mother. The candor and intimacy of this affecting memoir make it addictive reading. Its intelligence, passion and insight assure its place among the distinguished voices of our age proclaiming the ascendancy of the human spirit over tyranny. Cheng is now a U.S. resident. BOMC main selection; author tour. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Cheng's widely acclaimed book recounts in compelling specifics her persecution and imprisonment at the hands of Mao Zedong's "Cultural Revolution" (1966-1976). Inquisitors accused her of being a "spy" and "imperialist," but during the harrowing years of solitary confinement she never gave in, never confessed a lie. We read this, not so much for historical analysis, but, like the literature of the Gulag in Russia, for an example of a humane spirit telling terrible truths honestly, without bitterness or cynicism.

Radio, print and Internet advertising!</p><p>Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

Beaumont Mystery</h2><p><blockquote> <p>An explosive novel of betrayal and blood vengeance from the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <i>Long Time Gone</i>.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are those who don't deserve to live -- and the corpse floating in Elliot Bay may have been one of those people. Not surprisingly, many individuals -- too many, in fact -- are eager to take responsibility for the brutal slaying of the hated biotech executive whose alleged crimes ranged from the illegal trading of industrial secrets to rape. For Seattle Detective J.P. Beaumont -- who's drowning in his own life-shattering problems -- a case of seemingly justifiable homicide has sinister undertones, drawing the haunted policeman into a corporate nightmare of double deals, savage jealousies, and real blood spilled far too easily, as it leads him closer to a killer he's not sure he wants to find.</p></p><p>Long before she started her hot new series about Arizona sheriff Joanna Brady, J. A. Jance was already one of the stalwarts of the police procedural genre because of her books about Seattle homicide detective J. P. Beaumont. Like the Brady novels, the Beaumont books are a perfect balance of the personal and the professional--placing the main characters in human contexts without making them seem cute or trite. The latest Beaumont, just out in paperback, is one of the best in the series: Beau wrestles at home with his own dying ex-wife and the vindictive former spouse of his best friend, while his office time is spent trying to discover who murdered a very nasty biotech executive. Previous Beaumont books in paperback include: <i>Dismissed With Prejudice</i>, <i>Failure to Appear</i>, <i>Improbable Cause</i>, <i>Lying in Wait</i>, <i>Minor in Possession</i>, <i>Until Proven Guilty</i>, <i>Without Due Process</i>.6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>G Is for Gumshoe</h2><p>"One of the sassiest, most appealing of the recent spate of female gunshoes . . .

It's the last that convinces Kinsey even she can't handle whoever's been hired to whack her, and she gets herself a bodyguard: Robert Dietz, a Porsche-driving P.I. who takes guarding Kinsey's body very seriously. With Dietz watching her for the merest sign of her usual recklessness, Kinsey plunges into her case. And before it's over, she'll unearth the gruesome truth about a long-buried betrayal and, in the process, come fact-to-face with her own mortality. . . . <br><br>"Wit is the most versatile weapon in Sue Grafton's well-stocked arsenal, and she uses it with disarming precision. . . .

A tanking economy has prompted Dr. Kay Scarpetta&#x2014;despite her busy schedule and her continuing work as the senior forensic analyst for CNN&#x2014;to offer her services pro bono to New York City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. In no time at all, her increased visibility seems to precipitate a string of unexpected and unsettling events. She is asked live on the air about the sensational case of Hannah Starr, who has vanished and is presumed dead. Moments later during the same telecast she receives a startling call&#x2014;in from a former psychiatrist patient of Benton Wesley's. When she returns after the show to the apartment where she and Benton live, she finds an ominous package&#x2014;possibly a bomb&#x2014;waiting for her at the front desk. Soon the apparent threat on Scarpetta's life finds her embroiled in a surreal plot that includes a famous actor accused of an unthinkable sex crime and the disappearance of a beautiful millionaires with whom Lucy seems to have shared a secret past.<br><br> Scarpetta's CNN producer wants her to launch a TV show called <em>The Scarpetta Factor</em>. Given the bizarre events already in play, she fears that her growing fame will generate the illusion that she has a "special factor," a mythical ability to solve all her cases. She wonders if she will end up like other TV personalities: her own stereotype.<br><br> <em>The Scarpetta Factor</em>, the seventeenth in the series, finds the familiar cast of characters together again in New York. Marino is working for the NYPD; Benton Wesley uses his forensic psychological expertise at Kirby and Bellevue; and Lucy continues to dazzle with her expertise in forensic computer investigations as she works yet another case with NY prosecutor Jaime Berger.<br><br></p><p><p><strong>Patricia Cornwell and James Patterson: Author One-on-One</strong><br> In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together blockbuster authors Patricia Cornwell and James Patterson and asked them to interview each other. Find out what two of the top authors of their genres have to say about their characters, writing process, and more.</p> <p>James Patterson is one of the bestselling writers of all time, with more than 170 million copies of his books sold worldwide. He is the author of two of the most popular detective series of the past decade, featuring Alex Cross and the Women's Murder Club, and he also writes nonfiction and The Maximum Ride series for young readers. Read on to see James Patterson's questions for Patricia Cornwell, or turn the tables to see what Cornwell asked Patterson.</p> <p> <strong>Patterson</strong>: Here's a chance to say all the great things the critics would about <em>The Scarpetta Factor</em>, if there were any newspapers left that still reviewed books. Or, as they say in the TV interviews: Tell us about this one, Patricia. <br></p> <p><strong>Cornwell</strong>: As was true in the last book (<em>Scarpetta</em>), the new one is set in New York City, and it begins with Kay Scarpetta working on the autopsy of a young woman who presumably was murdered the night before in Central Park. While the apparent circumstances of the violent crime say one thing, the body is telling Scarpetta a very different and incredibly disturbing story that causes the prosecutor, the police, other officials, and even Scarpetta's friends and colleagues, to wonder if she's making mistakes or has begun to believe her own legend. While others are questioning and criticizing her, she begins to doubt herself and her decision to be the senior forensic analyst for CNN&#x2014;an exposure that possibly leads to her BlackBerry disappearing and a suspicious package being left for her at her apartment building. As the intrigue unfolds, the past is no longer past, and she is soon faced with an old nemesis who threatens to be her final undoing.</p> <strong>Patterson</strong>: This book is set in New York again&#x2014;what do you like about the Big City? What don't you like? <strong><br><br>Cornwell</strong>: Certainly New York City is the ultimate Big City. By placing Scarpetta in the midst of NYC within its medical examiner's office, I've positioned her on an international stage where anything can and does happen. The machinery is huge (NYPD and the FBI field office, for example), yet the private lives of the characters remain intimate and small. Not only is this a big story about a big-city case that captivates the world, it's also a very close look at the characters and who and what they are to one another in contemporary times. In terms of what I like and don't like about NYC? The only thing I don't like about it is driving there. <br><br><strong>Patterson</strong>: I often get asked what I have in common with Alex Cross. What would you say you have in common with Kay Scarpetta? <br><br><strong>Cornwell</strong>: Scarpetta and I share the same values and sensibilities. We approach cases the same way (which should be rather obvious, since I work the cases by taking on her persona). Beyond that, there are many differences. I'm not Catholic or Italian or married to Benton Wesley. I'm not a forensic pathologist with a law degree. I don't have her emotional discipline or inhibitions, nor do I have her professional dazzle. (I always remind people I was an English major who started working at age eleven, first as a babysitter, then in food service!) I don't have Scarpetta's pedigree. But then, she isn't a writer, unless she's writing professional journal articles or autopsy reports. <strong><br><br>Patterson</strong>: What's your routine like when it comes to writing? Do you do write every day? On the road? Do you need vacations from your writing? <strong><br><br>Cornwell</strong>: I wish I had more of a routine. I begin each book with research that continues up to the very end of the process. But gradually, as I approach the deadline, I sink deeper into seclusion until eventually I don&#x2019;t even answer e-mails or the phone anymore (unless it's my partner, Staci). I just write morning, noon, and night. The pulling together and completion of a novel is so intense, I'm almost living out of body by the time I'm done. It's the most wonderful and miserable experience imaginable. I would love a vacation but never seem to have time, and I doubt I'd know what to do if you made me "do nothing." In fact, Staci and I have a strange habit of going to foreign lands and visiting their police departments and morgues instead of just hanging out at the beach. I don't write every day because I do so much research, and currently, I have many other responsibilities that keep me busier than ever (filming, involvement with forensic institutes&#x2014;just the business of life, for example). <strong><br><br>Patterson</strong>: What's the best feedback you've had from a reader? Or&#x2014;what was the best piece of writing advice you've had? <strong><br><br>Cornwell</strong>: Frankly, the best feedback was when a reader complained some years ago that he wasn&#x2019;t sure I liked my characters anymore. And I thought about this and realized I wasn&#x2019;t sure I did, either. A horrible thing to realize. It was because the series had gone on for so long that it was time to reinvent the characters and their relationships with one another and the world they inhabit. I think this remake is most apparent in the last book, <em>Scarpetta</em>, and I am on a wonderful and invigorating new course that is even more evident in the new one, <em>The Scarpetta Factor</em>. <strong><br><br>Patterson</strong>: Bonus question: How do you feel about the Hollywood adaptations of your work? Don't be afraid&#x2014;let it all hang out. <strong><br><br>Cornwell</strong>: In the past, very disappointed, because the projects went nowhere. Now, so far so good. The first films (<em>Lifetime </em>movies of <em>At Risk</em> and <em>The Front</em>, which are non-Scarpetta novellas) air this spring. I had a magnificent experience from beginning to end with the producers, actors&#x2014;everyone. It's way too early to talk about the 20th Century Fox project with Angelina Jolie, although who wouldn't be excited about her? <br><br><b> Patricia Cornwell</b> is the former Director of Applied Forensic Science at the National Forensic Academy, and a member of the Harvard&#x2014;affiliated McLean Hospital's National Council, where she is an advocate for psychiatric research.

The sub-title on each of his math books is &#34;As Serious As it Needs to Be&#34;. And that is just the point: math doesn&#39;t need to be horrid and dry. This is math-just as serious as it needs to be-and I can tell you from Louisa&#39;s smiles and chuckles, that&#39;s not very serious at all! As a bonus, these books are very low priced compared to any other math books on the market. (Compare to Saxon at $50-70). If you have a creative child who is languishing on traditional math programs, try Life of Fred! Math, As Serious As it Needs to Be! If you know your math facts (addition and multiplication) and you can read well, then the next step is to get to know Fred! Beware: This is not a traditional math book. This is a child-directed course. The student reads the adventure story, does the math problems that occur as a natural part of the story, and checks their answers (the solutions are right there for the looking.) And learns to love math in the process! You will not get the detailed formula explanations that you get in a traditional math book. I am still amazed that kids can read the story and learn the concepts, but they do!</p><p></p><h2>The Pastry Queen Christmas: Big-hearted Holiday Entertaining, Texas Style</h2><p><b>It's Christmastime at the Best Little Bakery in Texas</b><br><br> The annual Fredericksburg Christmas parade marks the beginning of the Texas Hill Country's holiday season, which means the Pastry Queen is kicking into high gear at her Rather Sweet Bakery and Caf�.

Once an architectural student at the Rhode Island School of Design, Macaulay glories in the intricacies and beauty of structure, as evidenced in his masterful pen-and-ink drawings in critically acclaimed children's books such as <i>Castle</i>, <i>Pyramid</i>, and <i>Rome Antics</i>. He begins <i>Cathedral</i> in 1252, when the people of a fictitious French town named Chutreaux decide to build a cathedral after their existing church is struck by lightning. We first meet the craftspeople, then examine the tools, study their cathedral plans, and watch the laying of the foundation. Week by week we witness the construction of this glorious temple to God. Macaulay intuitively hones in on the details about which we are the most curious: How were those enormously high ceilings built and decorated? How were those 60-foot-high windows made and installed in the 13th century? And how did people haul those huge, heavy bells up into the skyscraper-high towers? Thanks to Macaulay's thorough, thoughtful tribute to the Gothic cathedral, not a stone, turret, or pane of stained glass is left unexamined or unexplained. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Gail Hudson</i>David Macaulay is an award-winning author and illustrator whose books have sold millions of copies in the United States alone, and his work has been translated into a dozen languages.

Written by one of the most widely read and respected art critics of our time as an outgrowth and expansion of his major eight-part BBC Time-Life television series, it recounts the origins of modern painting, sculpture, and architecture; discusses the careers of the major artists; shows how their work was shaped by the cataclysmic events of the new century; makes plain why modernism has today very nearly run its course &#x2013; and does all this with verve, command of anecdote and scholarship, and a critical poise that is nothing short of dazzling. In eight fascinating chapters Robert Hughes explores the cultural fruit of nineteenth-century industrialism, the legacy of World War I, art in the lyric mode, the glorious failure of modern architecture, the outbreak of irrationality, the art of extreme emotion, art gripped by the media, why the avant-garde is no more, and where, if anywhere, art goes from here ... Deeply informed, dashingly written, wonderfully illustrated (more than 250 pictures, nearly all in full color, constituting in themselves an extraordinary gallery of great works of modern art), The Shock of the New is history and art criticism at their most appealing and accessible, a book to learn from -- and to delight in.</p><p>A beautifully illustrated hundred-year history of modern art, from cubism to pop and avant-guard. More than 250 color photos.Robert Hughes has been an art critic for Time magazine since 1970. His eight-part BBC/Time-Life television series, on which this book is based, has been broadcast throughout the United States on public television. He has received the Franklin Jewett Mather Award for Distinguished Criticism from the College Art Association of America twice, and he has authored the Art of Australia (1966); Heaven and Hell in Western Art (1969); and Nothing If Not Critical (1990), a collection of essays on art and artists.</p><h2>The Tactical Edge: Surviving High-Risk Patrol</h2><p>For those officers that want to win</p><p></p><h2>Positivity Bias</h2><p>Through a mix of nature, nurture, social conditioning and free will, we each possess a personalized lens that frames, forms, clouds and distorts the way we see ourselves and the world around us. In order to live in the most meaningful and effective way possible, each of us needs to continually assess and adjust the default frames we have developed.<br><br>In Positivity Bias, we learn that life is essentially good; that positive perception is applicable and accessible to all; that it derives from objective, rational insight, not subjective, wishful imagination, and that positive living is a matter of choice, not circumstance. <br><br>An inspiring and life-enriching tapestry woven from hundreds of stories, letter, anecdotes, and vignettes - Positivity Bias highlights how the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M.

All the lines are primary writing lines (a dashed line between two solid lines), and there are far fewer than in the original journal. This Junior Notebooking Journal is perfect for: Younger students that have not yet mastered handwriting Older students that are delayed in handwriting mastery Older students with learning disabilities Students that are new to written narration Each lesson in the junior journal begins with two fun coloring pages for the student to color while he listens to the reading of the text. The coloring pages reinforce the lesson&#39;s content and match the learning exercises with visible body organs on children doing every day activities. These pages are followed by a template designed to encourage creative expression. The children can illustrate what they have learned and write a sentence or two about the topic. Next, the student is given the opportunity to work with and learn the key vocabulary words presented in the text. Included are puzzle piece cut-out and match vocabulary activities, lift the flap vocabulary activities, partially filled-in crosswords (only two crosswords in the junior journal compared with one for each lesson in the other notebooking journals), and many more. These learning activities give the student another opportunity to see and think about the most important vocabulary words found in the lesson, increasing his retention of both the important terms and the subject matter of the text. As well as vocabulary work, the student has a choice between print copywork, cursive, or both. The Scriptures used for copywork are shorter than in the original notebooking journal, and the font is larger. Further, when a notebooking activity requires the student to label a diagram, a template is provided. Pointers to each part of the organ that needs to be labeled are included as well as the correct number of spaces the student needs to write the word correctly. The first letter of each word has been filled in for extra help. Templates to complete all the notebooking assignments, the Personal Person Project with transparencies for the organs, project record keeping, Scientific Speculation Sheets and, of course, the same beautiful, full-colored miniature books found in the original notebooking journals are included in the junior journal. There are some higher level activities missing from the junior journal, but they are replaced with cut and paste activities that bring the subject to life. What&#39;s missing? The lengthy and technical Vocabulary Crosswords The What Do You Remember? written review questions The Final Review These junior journals will be perfect for the beginning writer or the child who is not yet writing well. Every child writes at a different age, so age is not the best factor when determining whether to purchase a regular notebooking journal or the junior journal. The best determining factor is whether or not the child feels comfortable writing paragraphs. If not, the junior journal is a great tool to help the child begin incorporating writing into his learning. Perfect for younger elementary students or those students with limited writing skills.</p><p>Jeannie Fulbright is a mother of four with a love for God s Word, her family, homeschooling, science, and encouraging homeschool parents.

An indignant, outrageous, witty, deeply felt collection of reviews, essays, and speeches, this is a window not only into Vonnegut&#x2019;s mind but also into his heart.</p></p><p>While a young PR man at General Electric, KURT VONNEGUT (1922-2007) sold his first short story to one of the many literary publications that were thriving then. By the time he'd sold his third, Vonnegut quit GE to join the likes of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner to write short stories at fifteen-hundred dollars a piece, before his first novel, <i>Player Piano</i>, launched his remarkable career as a countercultural novelist.<i>Preface<br></i><br><br>Dear Reader:<br><br>The title of this book is composed of three words from my novel Cat's Cradle. A wampeter is an object around which the lives of many otherwise unrelated people may revolve. The Holy Grail would be a case in point. Foma are harmless untruths, intended to comfort simple souls. An example: "Prosperity is just around the corner." A granfalloon is a proud and meaningless association of human beings. Taken together, the words form as good an umbrella as any for this collection of some of the reviews and essays I have written, a few of the speeches I have made. Most of my speeches were never written down.<br><br>. . . <br><br>I used to make speeches all the time. I needed the applause. I needed the easy money. And then, while I was doing my regular routine of Hoosier shit-kicking on the stage of the Library of Congress, a circuit breaker in my head snapped out. I had nothing more to say. That was the end of my speaking career. I spoke a few times after that, but I was no longer the glib Philosopher of the Prairies it had once been so easy for me to be.<br><br>The proximate cause of my mind's shutting off in Washington was a question from the floor. The middle-aged man who asked it appeared to me to be a recent refugee from Middle Europe. "You are a leader of American young people," he said. "What right do you have to teach them to be so cynical and pessimistic?"<br><br>I was not a leader of American young people. I was a writer who should have been home and writing, rather than seeking easy money and applause.<br><br>. . . <br><br>I can name several good American writers who have become wonderful public speakers, who now find it hard to concentrate while they are merely writing. They miss the applause.<br><br>I do think, though, that public speaking is almost the only way a poet or a novelist or a playwright can have any political effectiveness in his creative prime. If he tries to put his politics into a work of the imagination, he will foul up his work beyond all recognition.<br><br>. . . <br><br>Among the many queer things about the American economy is this: A writer can get more money for a bungling speech at a bankrupt college than he can get for a short-story masterpiece. What's more, he can sell the speech over and over again, and no one complains.<br><br>. . . <br><br>People complain so rarely about bad speeches, even speeches costing a thousand dollars and more. That I have wondered if anybody really hears them. And I received an interesting opinion on how people listen to them right before my speech to the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Institute of Arts and Letters, which is in this book.<br><br>I was seasick with dread before I gave the speech. I was seated between a famous old architect, and the president of the Academy. We were three skinny, blank-faced human beings, in full view of the audience. We spoke as convicts in motion pictures to, when planning a break under the eyes of guards.<br><br>I told the architect how frightened I was. I expected him to comfort me. But he replied pitilessly, and in a voice the president could hear, that the president had read my speech and detested it.<br><br>I asked the president if this was so.<br><br>"Yes," he said. "But don't worry about it."<br><br>I reminded him that I still had to deliver the detestable speech.<br><br>"Nobody is going to listen to what you say," he assured me. "People are seldom interested in the actual content of a speech. They simply want to learn from your tone and gestures and expressions whether or not you are an honest man."<br><br>"Thank you," I said.<br><br>"I will bring the meeting to order," he said. And he did. And I spoke.<br><br>. . . <br><br>In this miracle age of organ transplants and other forms of therapeutic vivisection, it would be wrong of me to protest my being dissected while still alive. Two nice young college professors, Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa, and John Somer of Kansas State Teachers College, are doing just that to me. They have published one seemingly posthumous volume, The Vonnegut Statement, a collection of essays about me. And they proposed to do another: a collection of everything I had ever written and which had never been put between hard covers before.<br><br>They presented my publisher with an appallingly complete bibliography. I keep no records of my work, and had been delighted to forget a lot of it. Klinkowitz and Somer refreshed my memory with their rap sheet. Their intentions were friendly. They thought of themselves as archaeologists, unearthing primitive artifacts which might help to explain whatever it is I have become. But some of the ugliest artifacts were actually of very recent origin. When I examined all the crap indubitably associated with my body, I did not feel like the ghost of Tutankhamen. I felt like a person who was creepily alive, still, and justly accused of petty crimes.<br><br>. . . <br><br>From all that crap, I have called this volume. I would not have been able to do it without the help of Klinkowitz and Somer, who knew where almost all the bodies were hidden. There are only three or four works of mine they know nothing about. Not even the ordeal of the veglia, said to be the most excruciating torture ever devised by Earthlings, could compel me to reveal where those three or four were published--and when.<br><br>This is not a book of my laundry lists, so to speak. I am pleased to have most of this stuff preserved. There are several short stories which have never been collected. I am content to leave them that way, except for one, Fortitude, a screenplay for an unproduced short science-fiction film. That is the only fiction in this book.<br><br>Everything else in here shows me trying to tell the truth nakedly, without the ornaments of fiction, about this or that. Which brings us to a discussion of the place of the "New Journalism," as opposed to fiction, in the literature of modern times.<br><br>. . . <br><br>Thucydides is the first New Journalist I know anything about. He was a celebrity who put himself at the center of the truths he was trying to tell, and he guessed when he had to, and he thought it worthwhile to be charming and entertaining. He was a good teacher. He did not wish to put his students to sleep with the truth, and he meant to put the truth into strikingly human terms, so his students would remember.<br><br>He is to be admired for his usefulness and good citizenship, and so is anybody who writes or teaches that way today. I am crazy about Hunter Thompson, for instance, on the account, and I say so in a review I have included in this book.<br><br>Am I a New Journalist? I guess. There's some New Journalism in here--about Biafra, about the Republican Convention of 1972. It's loose and personal.<br><br>But I am not tempted to do much more of that sort of stuff. I have wavered some on this, but I am now persuaded again that acknowledged fiction is a much more truthful way of telling the truth than the New Journalism is. Or, to put it another way, the very finest New Journalism is fiction. In either art form, we have an idiosyncratic reporter. The New Journalist isn't free to tell nearly as much as a fiction writer, to show as much. There are many places he can't take his reader, whereas the fiction writer can take the reader anywhere, including the planet Jupiter, in case there's something worth seeing there.<br><br>In either case, the principal issue, as I learned at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, is whether or not the person who is trying to tell the truth gives the impression of being an honest man.<br><br>. . . <br><br>I am reminded now, as I think about news and fiction, of a demonstration of the difference between noise and melody which I saw and heard in freshman physics lecture at Cornell University so long ago. (Freshman physics is invariably the most satisfying course offered by any American university.) The professor threw a narrow board, which was about the length of a bayonet, at the wall of the room, which was cinder block. "That's noise," he said.<br><br>Then he picked up seven more boards, and he threw them against the wall in rapid succession, as though he were a knife-thrower. The boards in sequence sang the opening notes of "Mary Had a Little Lamb." I was enchanted.<br><br>"That's melody," he said.<br><br>And fiction is melody, and journalism, new or old, is noise.<br><br>. . . <br><br>He gave a lecture on equilibrium, too. He stood behind a twenty-foot row of waist-high cabinets in front of the room. He had a string tied to his finger. And, as he said this and that about equilibrium, he appeared to be playing with a yo-yo, which we couldn't see because of the cabinets.<br><br>He kept that up for the better part of an hour. At last he raised his arm so we could see what was on the other end of the string. It was a piece of wood molding twenty-feet long, with the string tied to its midpoint.<br><br>"That," he said, "is equilibrium."<br><br>I keep losing and regaining my equilibrium, which is the basic plot of all popular fiction. And I myself am a work of fiction. I remember I was with the theatrical producer Hilly Elkins one time. He had just bought the film rights to Cat's Cradle, and I was attempting to become urbane. I made some urbane remarks, and Hilly shook his head, and he said, "No, no, no. No, no. Go for Will Rogers, not for Cary Grant."<br><br>. . . <br><br>I happen to have my equilibrium just now. I received a note from a twelve-year-old this morning. He had read my latest novel, Breakfast of Champions, and he said, "Dear Mr. Vonnegut: Please don't commit suicide." God love him. I have told him I am fine.<br><br>This book is dedicated to a person who helped me to regain my equilibrium. I say she cronkled me. That is another coined word. She came to me with an expressed wish to "chronicle" my wonderful life from day to day on photographic film. What eventuated was much deeper than mere chronicling.<br><br>. . . <br><br>The Playboy Interview with me in this book is almost as fictitious as my fleeting imitation of Cary Grant. It is what I should have said, not what I really said. Playboy showed me a typescript of what I had said into their tape recorder, and it was obvious to me that I had at least one thing in common with Joseph Conrad: English was my second language. Unlike Conrad: English was my second language. Unlike Conrad, I had no first language, so I went to work on the transcript with pen and pencil and scissors and paste, to make it appear that speaking my native tongue and thinking about important matters came very easily to me.<br><br>This is what I find most encouraging about the writing trades: They allow mediocre people who are patient and industrious to revise their stupidity, to edit themselves into something like intelligence, they also allow lunatics to seem saner than sane.<br><br>. . . <br><br>Here is my understanding of the Universe and mankind's place in it at the present time:<br><br>The seeming curvature of the Universe is an illusion. The Universe is really as straight as a string, except for a loop at either end. The loops are microscopic.<br><br>One tip of the string is forever vanishing. Its neighboring loop is forever retreating from extinction. The other end is forever growing. Its neighboring loop is forever pursuing Genesis.<br><br>In the beginning and in the end was Nothingness. Nothingness implied the possibility of Somethingness. It is impossible to make something from nothing. Therefore, Nothingness could only imply Somethingness. That implication is the Universe--as straight as a string, as I've already said, except for a loop at either end.<br><br>We are wisps of that implication.<br><br>The Universe does not teem with life. It is inhabited at only one point by creatures who can examine it and comment on it. That point is the planet Earth, which is forever at the exact center of the implication, midway between tips.<br><br>All the twinkles and glints in the night sky might as well be sparks from a cowboy's campfire, for all the life or wisdom they contain.<br><br>. . . <br><br>As for what happened to some of the people in this book: Not nearly as many Biafrans were butchered by the Nigerians at the end of the war as I had thought would be. The Nigerians were merciful. The brains of many Biafran children are probably damaged permanently by starvation caused by the Nigerians' blockade.<br><br>At the minimum, those damaged children, at the exact middle of the Universe, will be more honorable than Richard M. Nixon and more observant than God.<br><br>Mr. Nixon himself is a minor character in this book. He is the first President to hate the American people and all they stand for. He believes so vibrantly in his own purity, although he has committed crimes which are hideous, that I am bound to conclude that someone told him when he was very young that all serious crime was sexual, that no one could be a criminal who did not commit adultery or masturbate.<br><br>He is a useful man in that he has shown us that our Constitution is a defective document, which makes a childlike assumption that we would never elect a President who disliked us so. So we must amend the Constitution in order that we can more easily eject such a person from office and even put him in jail.<br><br>That is my chief Utopian scheme for the moment. My longer-range schemes have to do with providing all Americans with artificial extended families of a thousand members or more. Only when we have overcome loneliness can we begin to share wealth and work more fairly. I honestly believe that we will have those families by-and-by, and I hope they will become international.<br><br>. . . <br><br>I had hoped to include some poetry in this volume, but discovered that I have in all these years written only one poem which deserves to live another minute. This is it:<br><br>We do,<br>Deedley do, doodley do, doodley do,<br>What we must,<br>Muddily must, muddily must, muddily must;<br>Muddily do,<br>Muddily do, muddily do, muddily do,<br>Until we bust,<br>Bodily bust, bodily bust, bodily bust.<br><br>One of the lost pieces of mine which I hope Professors Klinkowitz and Somer will never find has to do with my debt to a black cook my family had when I was a child. Her name was Ida Young, and I probably spent more time with her than I spent with anybody--until I got married, of course. She knew the Bible by heart, and she found plenty of comfort and wisdom in there. She knew a lot of American history, too--things she and other black people had seen and marveled at, and remembered and still talked about, in Indiana and Illinois and Ohio--and Kentucky and Tennessee. She would read to me, too, from an anthology of sentimental poetry about love which would not die, about faithful dogs and humble cottages where happiness was, about people growing old, about visits to cemeteries, about babies who died. I remember the name of the book, and wish I had a copy, since it has so much to do with what I am.<br><br>The name of the book was More Heart Throbs; and it was an easy jump from that to The Spoon River Anthology, by Edgar Lee Masters, to Main street, by Sinclair Lewis, to U.S.A., by John Dos Passos, to my thinking now. There is an almost intolerable sentimentality beneath everything I write. British critics complain about it. And Robert Scholes, the American critic, once said I put bitter coatings on sugar pills.<br><br>It's too late to change now. At least I am aware of my origins--in a bit, brick dreamhouse designed by my architect father, where nobody was home for long periods of time, except for me and Ida Young.<br><br>. . . <br><br>There is a piece in this book about Tony Costa, a Cape Codder who was a friend of my daughter Edith. He was accused of several murders. It was decided that he was insane, and thus beyond ordinary punishment.

Lilly and her clothing wholeheartedly embrace color -- she made famous the pink and green combination -- and her love of vibrant hues and bold prints led the <em>New York Times</em> to recently call her "a major force in prep resort wear for forty years."</p><p>But Lilly Pulitzer Rousseau is also almost as well-known for her entertaining as she is for her fashions. A tribute to her insouciant lifestyle, <em>Essentially Lilly</em> is lavishly illustrated and peppered with anecdotal memories of a life filled with color. Joined by her family and close friends, Lilly recalls the parties, the decorating, the food, and the fashion that have been part of her life in Palm Beach since she arrived there in the 1950s.</p><p>With sections devoted to each part of the day, <em>Essentially Lilly</em> captures a variety of social events -- from a sunrise sail to a beach supper under the stars -- and imbues each with singular "Lilly style": </p><p>Mellow Yellow Mornings -- start the day off easy with a walk on the beach or a luxuriously lazy breakfast in bed. Take some friends out for an early morning sail or a country club brunch. Round off the morning hunting for a one-of-a-kind treasure at a local flea market.</p><p>Think Pink Afternoons -- rev up the middle of the day with a bridesmaids' lunch, a birthday cookout, or a charity tea. Perhaps you'd rather relax with a fruity pool party or a "just-looking" stroll down Palm Beach's fabled Worth Avenue.True Blue Evenings -- gather your friends together for a festive cocktail party or a romantic beach dinner under a full moon. Maybe it's a deep woods campfire that appeals to you, or watching a movie out under the stars, or just a simple pizza party for your family.</p><p><em>Essentially Lilly</em> presents memories and menus, beautiful photographs and dazzling illustrations as well as dozens of recipes and entertaining suggestions to make your own get-togethers as successful as one of Lilly's famed parties. Best of all, Lilly offers her spirited advice throughout: "Just relax and have fun -- and be an individual," she says. "It's better that you enjoy yourself than it is to get it right." Good rules to live by. </p><p></p><p></p><p>"LILLY PULITZER trademarks and logos are the property of Sugartown Worldwide, Inc. The book, including the design on the cover, are Copyright � 2004 Sugartown Worldwide, Inc." </p></p><p>For more than 40 years, designer Lilly Pulitzer has lead the charge in pretty, preppy chic--a resort look long-worshipped by prim teens and stylish ladies alike. While the signature pink-and-lime-green floral frocks are what she's famous for, Pulitzer has also become known over the decades as the consummate hostess, now celebrated in her book <i>Essentially Lilly: A Guide to Colorful Entertaining</i>. Like most people with great style who aren't shy about showing it, Pulitzer put her personal stamp of informal elegance on all her gatherings, turning her home in Palm Beach back in the sixties (and beyond) into a "famously unstuffy" stomping ground for the resort town's movers and shakers. Unlike other entertaining tomes, Essentially Lilly doesn't go the route of practical party planning. Instead, Pulitzer's book unfolds like a diary of sorts, a scrapbook of her life chronicling inspirations, favorite moments, and events. Chapters are broken down into three sections reflective of the designer's lively aesthetic ("Mellow Yellow Mornings," "Think Pink Afternoons," "True Blue Evenings"), and ideas come by way of Pulitzer's Palm Beach passions--sunrise sails to the Bahamas, golf and tennis, weddings in her jungle slat house, and treasure hunting, among other things. In lieu of countless recipes (though there are a few good ones), Pulitzer extends a broader one--a more personal formula for a fun life, and in this, <i>Essentially Lilly</i> is dynamic and sincere. <i>--Christene Barberich</i><p>Lilly Pulitzer is the queen of pink and green.

The ancient Greeks scorned it as ugly and barbaric, but most Americans and Europeans now cite it as their favorite color. In this fascinating history, the renowned medievalist Michel Pastoureau traces the changing meanings of blue from its rare appearance in prehistoric art to its international ubiquity today. </p><p>Any history of color is, above all, a social history. Pastoureau investigates how the ever-changing role of blue in society has been reflected in manuscripts, stained glass, heraldry, clothing, paintings, and popular culture. Beginning with the almost total absence of blue from ancient Western art and language, the story moves to medieval Europe. As people began to associate blue with the Virgin Mary, the color became a powerful element in church decoration and symbolism. Blue gained new favor as a royal color in the twelfth century and became a formidable political and military force during the French Revolution. As blue triumphed in the modern era, new shades were created and blue became the color of romance and the blues. Finally, Pastoureau follows blue into contemporary times, when military clothing gave way to the everyday uniform of blue jeans and blue became the universal and unifying color of the Earth as seen from space.</p><p>Beautifully illustrated, <i>Blue</i> tells the intriguing story of our favorite color and the cultures that have hated it, loved it, and made it essential to some of our greatest works of art.</p></p><p><p>"Michel Pastoureau paints a massive canvas in which the history of one color becomes the history of culture itself. This is a study not of color as mere matter but as idea--presenting thousands of years of thinking in blue."<b>--Michael Camille, author of <i>The Medieval Art of Love and Glorious Visions</i></b></p><p>"Michel Pastoureau brilliantly uses the shifting meanings of blue to challenge a whole spectrum of assumptions about color and its symbolic value. . . . Thanks to this study, which is certain to become a classic, blue will never look the same again."<b>--Jori Finkel and Jonathon S.

She rolled over, tapped me on the shoulder, and whispered, "Let's go swimming." It was two in the morning under a full moon, and I said, "Okay." The tap on the shoulder usually meant she knew something I didn't, and from the moment I'd met her, Maggie had known a lot that I didn't. <br> <br> We rolled out, grabbed a couple of towels, and held hands down to the river, where Maggie took a swan dive into the South Carolina moonlight. I dropped the towels on the bank and waded in, letting the sandy bottom sift through my toes and the bream shoot between my knees. Leaning backward, I dunked my head, closed my eyes, then let the water roll down my neck as I stood in the waist-deep black river. Summer had run too long, as summers in Digger often do, and the breeze was a welcome comfort. We swam around in the dark water long enough to cool off, and Maggie spread a towel over the bleached white sand. Then she lay down and rested her head on my shoulder, and the moon fell behind the cypress canopy. <br> <br> A while later, as we walked back to the house, her shoulder tucked under mine, Maggie knew that we had just made our son. I didn't know until four weeks later, when she came bouncing off the front porch and tackled me in the cornfield. Grinning, she shoved a little white stick in my face and pointed at the pink line. <br> <br> Soon after, I started noticing the changes. They began in our second bedroom. Previously an office, it quickly became "the nursery." Maggie returned from the hardware store with two gallons of blue paint for the walls and one gallon of white for the trim and molding. <br> <br> "What if she's a girl?" I asked.<br> <br> "He's not," she said and handed me a paintbrush. So we spread some old sheets across the hardwood floors and started goofing off like Tom and Huck. By the end of the night, we were covered in blue paint and the walls were not, but at least we'd made a start. <br> <br> The smell of paint drove us out of the house, so Maggie and I shopped the Saturday morning garage sales. We found a used crib for sixty dollars, the top railing dented with teeth marks. Maggie ran her fingers along the dents like Helen Keller reading Braille. "It's perfect," she said. <br> <br> We set up the crib in the corner of the nursery and made a Sunday afternoon drive to Charleston to the so-called "wholesale" baby outlet. I have never seen more baby stuff in one place in my entire life. And to be honest, before going there, I didn't know half of it existed. When we walked through the sliding glass doors, a recorded voice said, "Welcome to Baby World! If we don't have it, your baby doesn't need it!" The tone of voice gave me my first hint that I was in trouble. <br> <br> Maggie grabbed two pushcarts, shoved one into my stomach, put on her game face, and said, "Come on!" Midway down the first aisle I was in way over my head. We bought diapers, wipes, pacifiers, a tether for the pacifiers, bottles, nipples for the bottles, liners for the bottles, bottles to hold the bottles and keep the bottles warm, cream for diaper rash, ointment for diaper rash, powder for diaper rash, a car seat, blankets, rattles, a changing table, little buckets to organize all the stuff we had just bought, a baby bag, extra ointment, cream, and powder just for the baby bag, booties, a little hat to keep his head warm, and little books. About halfway through the store I quit counting and just said, "Yes, ma'am." <br> <br> To Maggie, every detail, no matter how small, had meaning. She must have said, "Oh, look at this," or "Isn't this cute?" a hundred times. When we reached the checkout counter, we were leaning on two ridiculously overflowing carts. <br> <br> Some marketing genius had stacked the most expensive teddy bears right up in front. Only a blind man was without excuse. Maggie, wearing a baggy pair of denim overalls, batted her big brown eyes and tilted her head. In a deep, whispery, and all-too-seductive voice, she said, "Dylan, this bear's name is Huckleberry." <br> <br> I just laughed. What else could I do? <br> <br> I loaded up the truck and started to breathe easy, thinking the damage was over, but we didn't even make it out of the parking lot. Just next door to Baby World stood a maternity clothing store. Maggie, the possessed power shopper, stalked the racks and piled me high for over an hour. When I could no longer see above the heap of clothes in my arms, she led me to the changing room, where, for the first time in my life, a woman actually told me to come inside with her. Maggie shut the door, slid the latch, and pulled her hair up into a bouncy ponytail. <br> <br> Over the next hour, my wife modeled each item of clothing while I marveled. The only light was a recessed forty-watt bulb above her head, but when she turned, lifted the ponytail off her neck, and whispered, "Unzip me," the light showered her five-eight frame like Tinkerbell's pixie dust. It fluttered off the blond, fuzzy hair on the back of her neck and the sweat on her top lip, over her square tan shoulders and down into the small of her back, along her thin hips and long runner's legs, and then finally swirled around the muscular shape of her calves. <br> <br> <i>God, I love my wife.</i> <br> <br> From shorts to shirts, pants, dresses, skirts, maternity bras, nursing bras, six-month underwear, nine-month underwear, jackets, and sweatshirts, the fashion show continued. As she tried on each item, Maggie stuffed the "eight-pound" pillow inside her waistband, put her hand on her hip, leaned forward on her toes, and looked at herself in the mirror. "Do you think this makes me look fat?"<br> <br> "Maggs, no man in his right mind would ever answer that question."<br> <br> "Dylan," she said, pointing her finger, "answer my question."<br> <br> "You're beautiful." <br> <br> "If you're lying to me," she said, raising her eyebrows and cocking her head, "you're on the couch." <br> <br> "Yes, ma'am."<br> <br> Leaving the dressing room, Maggie shone in full, glorious, pregnant-woman glow. Three hundred and twenty-seven dollars later, she was ready for any occasion. <br> <br> Life had never been more vivid, more colorful, as if God had poured the other end of the rainbow all around us. Rows of cotton, corn, soybean, peanuts, and watermelon rose from the dirt and formed a quilted patchwork, sewing itself with kudzu along the sides of the old South Carolina highway. Ancient gnarled and sprawling oaks covered in moss and crawling with red bugs and history swayed in the breeze and stood like silent sentinels over the plowed rows. Na�ve and unaware, we rumbled along the seams while Maggie placed my hand on her tummy and smiled.<br> <br> At twelve weeks we went for the first ultrasound. Maggie was starting to get what she called a "pooch" and could not have been prouder. When the doctor walked in, Maggie was lying on the table with a fetal monitor Velcroed across her stomach, holding my hand. The doc switched on the ultrasound machine, squeezed some gel on her stomach, and started waving the wand over her tummy. When she heard the heartbeat for the first time, Maggie started crying. "Dylan," she whispered, "that's our son."<br> <br> At sixteen weeks, the nurse confirmed Maggie's intuition. Maggie lay on the same table as the nurse searched her tummy with the ultrasound wand and then stopped when my son gave us a peek at his equipment. "Yep," the nurse said, "it's a boy. Right proud of himself too." <br> <br> I hit my knees. At twenty-nine years old, I had looked inside my wife's tummy and seen our son. As big as life, with his heart beating, and wiggling around for all the world to see. <br> <br> "Hey, Sport." <br> <br> That started my conversations with Maggie's stomach. Every night from that day forward, I'd talk to my small and growing son. The three of us would lie in bed; I'd lift Maggie's shirt just over her tummy, press my lips next to the peach-fuzzy skin near her belly button, and we'd talk. Football, girls, school, farming, tractors, dogs, cornfields, friends, colors, anything I could think of. I just wanted my son to know the sound of my voice. After a few days, he started kicking my lips. Before I told him good night, I'd sing "Johnny Appleseed," "Daddy Loves His Sweet Little Boy," "The Itsy-Bitsy Spider," or "Jesus Loves Me." <br> <br> Sometimes in the middle of the night, when the baby kicked or pushed his foot into the side of her stomach, Maggie would grab my hand and place it on her tummy. She never said a word, but I woke up feeling the warmth of my wife's stomach and the outline of my son's foot. <br> <br> Toward the end of the first trimester, while rummaging through a yard sale, I found a rickety old rocking horse that needed a lot of glue, some elbow grease, and a few coats of white paint. I brought it home, set up my woodworking shop in the barn, and told Maggie to stay out. A week later, I brought it inside and set it next to the crib. Maggie looked at it, and the tears came forth in a flood. I think that was my first realization that new hormones had taken over my wife's body and mind. <br> <br> Pretty soon the cravings hit. "Sweetheart." It was that whispery, seductive voice again. "I want some fresh, natural peanut butter and H�agen Dazs raspberry sorbet." <br> <br> I never knew it would be so difficult to find freshly churned natural peanut butter at ten o'clock at night. When I got back to the house, Maggie was standing on the front porch, tapping her foot and wielding a spoon. As soon as I got the lids off, we...</p></p><h2>Paddle-to-the-Sea</h2><p>A young Indian boy carves a little canoe with a figure inside and names him Paddle-to-the-Sea.

He then worked in a taxidermy department of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and spent time working in anthropology under Dr. Ralph Linton. During this period, he married Lucille Webster and within a year of their marriage accepted a position as art instructor on the first University World Cruise, sponsored by New York University. For many years, Holling C. Holling dedicated much of his time and interest to making books for children. Much of the material he used was known to him first hand, and his wife, Lucille, worked with him on many of the illustrations.An Indian boy carves a wooden canoe and writes an inscription that the canoe is trying to find the quickest route to the sea. He then sets the canoe into Lake Michigan and longingly watches it sail away. The canoe spends four years on the water, being picked up by loggers, fishermen, and families before finally making it to the sea. Its adventures give children a good idea of the wonders and diversity in the world. Terry Bregy reads in a voice befitting a bedtime tale.

You are seated by choice or misfortune in a window seat on an airplane. You look out as the plane takes off, rises up higher and higher, levels off. If you chance to glance down, you see a particular kind of order not realized on earth. You might feel a kind of hopefulness at the sight of houses clustered together in their various neighborhoods, at roads running straight or artfully curved, at what look like toy cars. You see the lakes and rivers, occasionally the wide stretch of ocean meeting horizon. You see natural quilts formed by the lay of fields and farmlands, you see the grouping of trees into parks and forests. Sometimes you see the splendor of autumn leaves or Fourth of July fireworks. Or sunsets. Or sunrises.<br><br>All of this can inspire something unnamable but nearly graspable, a kind of yearning toward a grand possibility.<br><br>And then you land.<br><br>But what if you landed differently?<br><br>Diamonds in a Box<br><br>After she has dried and put away her supper dishes, Lucille Howard sits at her kitchen table and contemplates what to do with another empty evening. A few years back, she might have sat out on the front porch with her former neighbor and then roommate, Arthur Moses, a man too good of heart for this world, in Lucille&#x2019;s opinion, though she and many others profited plenty from his continual kindness.<br><br>She pushes herself up from the table and goes out onto her front porch to stand with her hands on her hips, taking in a better view of the night sky. From the kitchen window the stars are so clear they look like diamonds; out here, it&#x2019;s even more glorious.<br><br>As a child, Lucille thought stars were diamonds, and that if only she prayed in the right way, the cigar box she kept under her bed would be filled with them some morning, and she could make a necklace out of them. Never happened. Well, of course it never happened, stars are not diamonds. They&#x2019;re suns, really, just balls of gas. If there&#x2019;s one thing Lucille hates, it&#x2019;s how science has to rain on whimsy&#x2019;s parade: Rainbows not a gift from leprechauns offering pots of gold, but only a trick of refraction. A blue sky not a miles-wide painting done by a heavenly hand, but molecules scattering light. Still, when Lucille sees the stars strewn across the sky on a night like tonight, they&#x2019;re diamonds, and she thinks they might end up under her bed yet. Maybe she&#x2019;ll put a box back under there. Tradition. Whimsy. Hope. Magical thinking, oh, she knows it&#x2019;s magical thinking; and she knows, too, that she&#x2019;s more prone to it now than she ever was. But what fun to imagine kneeling down to lift the dust ruffle and just check. And there they are at last, diamonds in a box, shining so hard they light up the surprised oval of her face.<br><br>It&#x2019;s cold enough for a jacket, this being the first of October, but Lucille is still in the habit of summer (the roses still blooming!) and so has neglected to put one on. It feels like too much work to go back in and get one, so she settles into a rocking chair, wraps her arms around herself, and moves vigorously back and forth. There. That&#x2019;s fine. It&#x2019;s good for you to be a bit uncomfortable from time to time, especially if you&#x2019;re only a few steps away from relief. People forget about the value of adversity. It was something she always tried to teach her fourth-grade students, how adversity can strengthen character. She also tried to teach them the value of having to work for something instead of it being handed to you the instant you said you wanted it. That&#x2019;s what happens these days, no one waits for anything. But Lucille used to give her class construction-paper coupons with points for good behavior or for scholastic merit; and when they had enough points, she&#x2019;d bake them a little baby pie in a five-inch tin, whatever kind they wanted, and they got to keep the tin. They&#x2019;d loved that. Once, a boy named Danny Matthews had wanted to cut his pie up so that everyone in the twenty-three-pupil class could have some. That had been a good lesson in mathematics. Danny was one of those kids who was never much liked, no matter how hard he tried. He was a very clumsy boy (the kids called him Mr. Magoo for the way he tripped over and bumped into things), and perpetually disheveled. Well, Lucille liked him and his crooked grin, and he loved her&#x2014;he might act up with others, but he always listened to her. She heard he&#x2019;d enlisted and gotten killed in Afghanistan.<br><br>It was true what they told her on the first day of teachers&#x2019; college: you never forget some of your students. For Lucille, it was the cut-ups she could never keep from laughing at, the dreamers she had to keep reeling back into the classroom, and little Danny Matthews, with his ragged heart of gold.<br><br>Lucille gives herself a challenge: she&#x2019;ll stay out here until it feels like her teeth might chatter. Then she&#x2019;ll go inside, draw a bath, and have a soak in Epsom salts. One thing she&#x2019;s grateful for are the grab bars she&#x2019;s had installed, though even with them, getting herself down into the tub is a herculean task that reminds her a bit of elephants lowering themselves onto tiny stools, the way they used to have to do in the circus. She&#x2019;s glad no one can see her, the way she grunts and huffs and puffs. Lord! they would say. Why don&#x2019;t you switch to showers? You&#x2019;re eighty-eight! True, but mostly she feels like she&#x2019;s sixty-eight. When she was sixty-eight, she felt like she was forty-eight. And so, although she knows the logic is off, she tells everyone that she feels forty-eight.<br><br>Lucille will not give up her baths. No. In the tub, she is what she thinks being stoned must be like: she enjoys a feeling of timelessness and wide content. A float-y, perfumed detachment. After her bath, she&#x2019;ll read her Maeve Binchy book, and then she&#x2019;ll go to sleep.<br><br>Maeve Binchy died young. Seventy-two. Lucille bets there are seventy-two-year-olds who can still do the splits. If she could have given Maeve Binchy a year from her own life, you can bet she&#x2019;d have done it. She actually cried when Maeve Binchy died, she sat in a kitchen chair and twisted a Kleenex in her hands and cried, and she felt a little tornado of frustration in her midsection because there was another good one, gone too soon.<br><br>Well, bath and bed and then another day will be done, and she&#x2019;ll be another step closer to the exit grande. She&#x2019;s not morbid, she&#x2019;s not sad, she&#x2019;s just a realist. She is closer to death. Everyone is, from the moment they slide out of the womb. From time to time, Lucille even feels a jazzy jump of joy, thinking about the journey to the place no one knows about, really, never mind the stories of the bright light and the tunnel and whatnot. No one really knows.<br><br>Just as she&#x2019;s ready to get up and go inside, she sees the neighbor who bought her old house, right next door to the smaller house she lives in now, which was Arthur&#x2019;s house. He willed it to Maddy Harris, the girl who used to live here with them, and Lucille now rents it from Maddy, if you call &#x201c;rent&#x201d; simply taking care of the place. The neighbor is coming out to walk his dog. Lucille has nothing against dogs, but that one is the ugliest thing she&#x2019;s ever seen. An ancient, mid-size gray mutt who looks like he needs a shave. Bugged-out eyes like a pug. A bit bowlegged. A tail that looks more like Eeyore&#x2019;s than a dog&#x2019;s. And his name: Henry. Now, why in the world would you give a dog that looks like that a name befitting a king?<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Lucille,&#x201d; the man calls over.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello, Jason,&#x201d; Lucille answers, though she muffles the name a bit. Is it Jason? Or is it Jeremy? Or Jeffrey? It&#x2019;s a little past the point where she can ask; the neighbors have been there for almost a year. The J. person, his wife, Abby, and their ten-year-old son, whose name is . . . well, for heaven&#x2019;s sake. Starts with an L. Liam? Leroy? Lester?<br><br>She closes her eyes to concentrate. Lincoln! That&#x2019;s it. Another strange name, if you ask her. What&#x2019;s become of Spot and Rex and Champ for dogs? What&#x2019;s become of Mary and Sally and Billy for children?<br><br>This is what happens. You live past your time of importance and relevance and the world must be given over to the younger ones. Lucille is all right with that notion. As the old folks yielded to her as a young woman, she will yield to the young folks coming up after her. But there is one thing she&#x2019;s going to get before she is here no more. And that is a very specific miracle, which she feels is owed her. In spades.<br><br>Lucille has kept her eyes closed and is startled now by the sound of footsteps: J. and his dog, coming up onto her porch. She cries out and leaps to her feet.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; the man says. &#x201c;Did I scare you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d; She pulls her hand down from where it had flown up onto her chest.<br><br>&#x201c;I just wanted to ask you if you&#x2019;d be free to come to our house for dinner tomorrow night. Abby&#x2019;s been meaning to ask you forever, but we&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tomorrow night? What time?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seven?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Seven! How can your son wait that long to eat?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Six?&#x201d; the man asks, smiling.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s better.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, good, we&#x2019;ll see you then.&#x201d; J. pulls at the leash, but Henry apparently has no interest in going anywhere. He stares up at Lucille as though he&#x2019;s forgotten something in her house and won&#x2019;t leave without retrieving it.<br><br>&#x201c;Run along now, Henry,&#x201d; Lucille says. &#x201c;Obey your master.&#x201d;<br><br>The dog moves closer to her, sniffs at her toes, then at the hem of her pants. &#x201c;I was just going in . . .&#x201d; she says, and Henry barks: once, twice, excitedly.<br><br>Lucille puts her hands on her knees and bends toward the dog. &#x201c;What is it, girl?&#x201d; she asks. &#x201c;Is Gramps in trouble?&#x201d; She looks up at J., grinning.<br><br>The man stares at her blankly.<br><br>&#x201c;Lassie?&#x201d; Lucille says.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A show that used to be on TV? About a collie dog? And his boy, Timmy?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; J. says. &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; He pulls harder at the leash and the dog finally comes to him. &#x201c;See you tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bring dessert,&#x201d; Lucille says. She has some cake left over from the last class she taught. Her baking classes have been getting so popular that she recently put an ad in the local paper to hire some help.<br><br>The man turns around. &#x201c;Uh, we don&#x2019;t . . . I hope this doesn&#x2019;t offend you, but we don&#x2019;t eat dessert.&#x201d;<br><br>Lucille cannot think of one thing to say, but finally manages a stiff, &#x201c;I see.&#x201d; And here is a bit of a miracle right now, because what she really, really thought she&#x2019;d say is, &#x201c;Never mind, then. I don&#x2019;t want to come.&#x201d;<br><br>They&#x2019;re probably vegans. They&#x2019;ll probably have a square loaf of some brownish mass on an ugly pottery platter and a bunch of vegetables so barely cooked they&#x2019;re next to raw. Lucille will put a potpie in her oven before she goes over, so she can eat when she gets home.<br><br>She goes inside, and the warmth of her house settles around her. Come here, dearie, says the kitchen. Come and have a nice slice of cake.<br><br>She does exactly that. Yellow cake with milk-chocolate frosting, a classic, but if you use Lucille&#x2019;s recipe for yellow cake and buttercream (Southern, of course) it&#x2019;s a bit more than a classic. It&#x2019;s a table-pounder. It&#x2019;s a groaner. &#x201c;Oh, my goodness, this is five stars!&#x201d; said a woman who took the class, after she tasted the cake. &#x201c;Six!&#x201d; said another, her mouth full, and Lucille has to agree. She never expected that the adult response to her desserts would be more enthusiastic than the kids&#x2019;. But then for the young children she teaches (ages five to seven, no older, no younger, no exception), everything is still a wonder. One day, teaching a fancied-up version of Rice Krispies Treats, she had to compete for their attention with a squirrel that came to the kitchen window to look in. The weather&#x2019;s another distraction. Let big fat snowflakes fall, or thunder boom, or a sudden wind whoosh through the trees, and she&#x2019;s lost the entire class.<br><br>After Lucille eats the cake, she weighs herself in an effort not to have a second slice. It does not work, which she might have predicted, and so she does have a second slice. Well, she finishes the cake. Maybe it&#x2019;s two and half slices. Maybe it&#x2019;s three.<br><br>She bathes, and she supposes it&#x2019;s having eaten all that cake that makes it even more difficult than usual to get out of the tub. Worth it.<br><br>She climbs into bed, reads for a while, then turns out the light. She lies flat on her back and stares at the ceiling, aware of a throbbing loneliness that comes over her from time to time. &#x201c;Lucille Pearson,&#x201d; she says into the darkness. And then she says it again, more slowly, &#x201c;Luciiiiillllle Peeeearson.&#x201d; Still not right. &#x201c;Mrs. Frank Pearson,&#x201d; she says, quite briskly, even authoritatively. That&#x2019;s the one. That&#x2019;s how she would have said her name, if she&#x2019;d had the opportunity.<br><br>This is the first time she&#x2019;s ever said out loud what she would have been saying for five years now, had she married him. The words make for a quick mix of emotions: First a zippy thrill, then a big ploppy sense of contentment, and it&#x2019;s like butter in a pan, that feeling of contentment, melting and spreading out inside her. Then a terrible bitterness, because she is not Mrs. Frank Pearson, nor will she ever be.<br><br>She sighs and turns onto her side. Tears slide down her cheeks and she wipes them away. She supposes she&#x2019;ll always cry over Frank: finding the first and only love of her life in high school and losing him, then finding him again&#x2014;at eighty-three!&#x2014;only to lose him again, to a heart attack, just like that. Here, then gone again. So very much here, then so very much gone.<br><br>She closes her eyes and tells herself to dream of him. Oftentimes, it works, telling herself to dream of someone, and her dreams are increasingly very real-seeming. After the death of her friend Arthur, she could summon him up on a regular basis. She dreamed of Arthur sitting on the porch with her, as he so often used to do, eating cookies, taking his tiny bites and brushing crumbs carefully into his hand.</p><h2>The Embattled Vote in America: From the Founding to the Present</h2><p><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Case for Impeachment</i> shows that gerrymandering and voter suppression have a long history.</b></p><p><b>&#x201c;Lichtman&#x2019;s important book...uses history to contextualize the fix we&#x2019;re in today.

Yet the world&#x2019;s oldest continuously operating democracy guarantees no one, not even its citizens, the right to elect its leaders.</p><p>For most of U.S. history, suffrage has been a privilege restricted by wealth, sex, race, residence, literacy, criminal conviction, and citizenship. Economic qualifications were finally eliminated in the nineteenth century, but the ideal of a white man&#x2019;s republic persisted long after that.

Lichtman...marches us through the dark history of voter limitation, from the Founders to now, and the images he paints are not flattering. The Constitution itself is vague about voting rights...and as Lichtman escorts us through the decades, we see an ugly pattern: people in power doing everything they can to remain so... The author examines a wide variety of discrimination: by race, gender, place of origin (immigrants, as he reminds us, have rarely been welcome here). He spends a lot of time exploring the denial and suppression of the African-American vote, and he notes how such efforts have succeeded and how they continue to dampen voter turnout... The author also explores the issue of &#x2018;voter fraud&#x2019; that many (who wish to limit voting rights) have long raised. As Lichtman reveals, repeated studies have found virtually no evidence of it...

The precocious son of a zookeeper, 16-year-old Pi Patel is raised in Pondicherry, India, where he tries on various faiths for size, attracting "religions the way a dog attracts fleas." Planning a move to Canada, his father packs up the family and their menagerie and they hitch a ride on an enormous freighter. After a harrowing shipwreck, Pi finds himself adrift in the Pacific Ocean, trapped on a 26-foot lifeboat with a wounded zebra, a spotted hyena, a seasick orangutan, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger named Richard Parker ("His head was the size and color of the lifebuoy, with teeth"). It sounds like a colorful setup, but these wild beasts don't burst into song as if co-starring in an anthropomorphized Disney feature. After much gore and infighting, Pi and Richard Parker remain the boat's sole passengers, drifting for 227 days through shark-infested waters while fighting hunger, the elements, and an overactive imagination. In rich, hallucinatory passages, Pi recounts the harrowing journey as the days blur together, elegantly cataloging the endless passage of time and his struggles to survive: "It is pointless to say that this or that night was the worst of my life. I have so many bad nights to choose from that I've made none the champion." At one point in his journey, Pi recounts, "My greatest wish--other than salvation--was to have a book. A long book with a never-ending story. One that I could read again and again, with new eyes and fresh understanding each time." It's safe to say that the fabulous, fablelike <i>Life of Pi</i> is such a book. <p> First published in 2002, Martel's breathtaking breakout novel became an international bestseller and went on to win the Man Booker Prize, and was also named Amazon.com's Best Book of 2002. In 2005, after an international competition, Croatian artist Tomislav Torjanac was selected to illustrate a special edition of <i>Life of Pi</i> that features 40 stunning illustrations that present a new perspective on this modern classic. <i>--Brad Thomas Parsons</i> <br> </p> <br> <b>Amazon.com Exclusive: Outtakes from Tomislav Torjanac's Early Illustrations for <i>Life of Pi</i></b> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td><br>Tomislav Torjanac's Artist Statement<br></td></tr></tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br>Island Study</td> <td> <br>Lifeboat Study</td> <td> <br><i>"I quite deliberately dressed wild animals in tame costumes of my imagination."</i></td></tr></tbody></table> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br><i>"Only when they threw me overboard did I begin to have doubts..."</i></td> <td> <br><i>"And what a thump it was."</i></td> <td> <br><i>"I threw the mako towards the stern."</i></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>NATIONAL BESTSELLER <br>A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK of 2002 <br>Pi Patel, a God-loving boy and the son of a zookeeper, has a fervent love of stories and practices not only his native Hinduism, but also Christianity and Islam. When Pi is sixteen, his family and their zoo animals emigrate from India to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship. Alas, the ship sinks -- and Pi finds himself in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi. Can Pi and the tiger find their way to land? Can Pi's fear, knowledge, and cunning keep him alive until they do? <br>"An impassioned defense of zoos, a death-defying trans-Pacific sea adventure a la Kon-Tiki, and hilarious . . .: This audacious novel manages to be all of these." -- "The New Yorker" <br>"Life of Pi could renew your faith in the ability of novelists to invest even the most outrageous scenario with plausible life." -- "The New York Times Book Review" <br>"Life of Pi is a real adventure: brutal, tender, expressive, dramatic, and disarmingly funny. . . .

It informs students of the principles of historical rhetoric, including terms such as ethos, pathos, logos, and kairos, and then applies the concepts to modern issues such as the revolutionary uses of twitter, and climate change. This framework enables students to become critical consumers of the flood of persuasive media that compete for their attention. Moreover, Praxis encourages students to employ this rhetorical framework of concepts to the creation of their own texts. Each chapter features readings, activities, and assignments, some serious and thought provoking, while others are creative and fun. The key to this text is flexibility. It can be used as a stand-alone rhetoric with limited readings, or in conjunction with other readers such as the Fountainhead Press V Series. Praxis moves the student from theory to practical reason to action!</p><p></p><h2>Prentice Hall Literature World Masterpieces</h2><p>Prentice Hall Literature World Masterpieces</p><p></p><h2>Pete the Cat 12-Book Phonics Fun!: Includes 12 Mini-Books Featuring Short and Long Vowel Sounds (My First I Can Read)</h2><p><p><strong><em>New York Times</em><em>&nbsp;</em>bestselling author and artist James Dean&#x2019;s Pete the Cat helps kids learn to read with phonics.

These captivating words of wisdom from Oswald Chambers have challenged and inspired readers for more than 80 years.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oswald Chambers was a teacher and preacher whose messages cut to the heart of the gospel. &nbsp;His wife, Biddy, transcribed his lectures and sermons and compiled them into books, the most popular being <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i>. The title is taken from a thought in one of his sermons: &#x201c;Shut out every consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only&#x2014;My Utmost for His Highest.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chambers was a man completely devoted to Christ, and his life and writings clearly portray that. This daily devotional has inspired countless people to drink deeply from the biblical truths that Chambers so passionately championed.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>Oswald Chambers, a Scotsman who converted to Christianity in his teens under the ministry of Charles Spurgeon, has been affecting Christians with his devotional words since <i>My Utmost for His Highest</i> was first published in 1935. This acknowledged classic contains 365 daily readings that take heady doctrine and make it practical, realistic, and intensely personal. With humor and humility, Chambers speaks plainly to the common man struggling with devotion to Christ in daily living. Worldly cares and self-serving desires begin to lose their appeal as Chambers aides the reader in transforming his mind by viewing life through the instruction of God's Word. Richard Halverson, former chaplain of the United States Senate, attests to this: "no book except the Bible has influenced my walk with Christ at such deep maturing levels." This is Chambers's chief desire, directing the reader to "shut out every other consideration and keep yourself before God for this one thing only--My Utmost for His Highest... determined to be absolutely and entirely for Him and for Him alone." <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>It&#39;s one of the top-selling devotionals of all time...it&#39;s updated into today&#39;s language...and now it&#39;s available in a contemporary new package, with four covers targeting different audiences.

Nicknamed Sweet Abelli for her docile nature, Elena smiles on cue and has a charming response for everything. She&#x2019;s the favored daughter, the perfect mafia principessa . . . or was. Now, all she can see in the mirror&#x2019;s reflection is blood staining her hands like crimson paint. They say first impressions are everything . . . In the murky waters of New York&#x2019;s underworld, Elena&#x2019;s sister is arranged to marry Nicolas Russo. A Made Man, a boss, a cheat&#x2014;even measured against mafia standards. His reputation stretches far and wide and is darker than his black suits and ties. After his and Elena&#x2019;s first encounter ends with an accidental glare on her part, she realizes he&#x2019;s just as rude as he is handsome. She doesn&#x2019;t like the man or anything he stands for, though that doesn&#x2019;t stop her heart from pattering like rain against glass when he&#x2019;s near, nor the shiver that ghosts down her spine at the sound of his voice. And he&#x2019;s always near. Telling her what to do. Making her feel hotter than any future brother-in-law should. Elena may be the Sweet Abelli on the outside, but she&#x2019;s beginning to learn she has a taste for the darkness, for rough hands, cigarettes, and whiskey-colored eyes. Having already escaped one scandal, however, she can hardly afford to be swept up in another. Besides, even if he were hers, everyone knows you don&#x2019;t fall in love with a Made Man . . . right? This is a standalone forbidden romance.</p><p>The chemistry between Nicolas and Elena is sizzling, and no one can doubt their connection.

She is, after all, incredibly pregnant and feeling like she could pop at any moment. But, just her luck, twelve deadly beasts from hell have chosen this time to escape onto our plane, and they've made Charley their target. And so she takes refuge at the only place she thinks they can't get to her: the grounds of an abandoned convent. Of course, if hellhounds aren't enough, Charley also has a new case to hold her attention: the decades-old murder of a newly-vowed nun she keeps seeing in the shadows of the convent. <br>Add to that the still unsolved murder of her father, the strange behavior of her husband, and Charley's tendency to attract the, shall we say, undead, and she has her hands full...but also tied. While the angry hellhounds can't traverse the consecrated soil, they can lurk just beyond its borders like evil sentries, so Charley has been forbidden from leaving the sacred grounds. Luckily, she has her loyal team with her, and they're a scrappy bunch who won't let a few thirsty hellhounds deter them.</p><p>While the team scours the prophesies, searching for clues on the Twelve, for a way to kill them or at least send them back to hell, Charley just wants answers and is powerless to get them. But the mass of friends they've accrued helps. They convince her even more that everyone in her recent life has somehow been drawn to her, as though they were a part of a bigger picture all along. Their presence is comforting. But the good feelings don't last for long because Charley is about to get the surprise of her crazy, mixed-up, supernatural life....</p></p><p><p><i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling author DARYNDA JONES won a Golden Heart and a RITA for her manuscript <i>First Grave on the Right</i>.

Stranger things have happened, but if they have, Campion can&#x2019;t remember them: He&#x2019;s in hospital, the victim of an apparent accident, and with no memory of anything except the fact that the fate of the British Empire is somehow cradled in his bandaged hands. He can&#x2019;t remember his faithful manservant, he can&#x2019;t remember his fiance, and most particularly, he can&#x2019;t remember killing a policeman, a crime for which whispering voices outside his hospital room claim he will shortly hang. Escaping in a stolen car, Campion finds odd shreds of memory returning. His mission, he&#x2019;s certain, has something to do with the number 15 and also with the town of Bridge, which &#x2013; he dimly recalls &#x2013; is run by an ancient, hereditary, and extremely secretive sect. </p></p><p><p>Margaret Allingham was a prolific writer who sold her first story at age eight and published her first novel before turning 20.

Ranging from fundamental existential questions to the most pressing social issues of our time, <i>This Life </i>shows why our commitment to freedom and democracy should lead us beyond both religion and capitalism.</b><br><br>In this groundbreaking book, the philosopher Martin H�gglund challenges our received notions of faith and freedom. The faith we need to cultivate, he argues, is not a religious faith in eternity but a secular faith devoted to our finite life together. He shows that all spiritual questions of freedom are inseparable from economic and material conditions. What ultimately matters is how we treat one another in <i>this life, </i>and what we do with our time together. <br><br>H�gglund develops new existential and political principles while transforming our understanding of spiritual life. His critique of religion takes us to the heart of what it means to mourn our loved ones, be committed, and care about a sustainable world. His critique of capitalism demonstrates that we fail to sustain our democratic values because our lives depend on wage labor. In clear and pathbreaking terms, H�gglund explains why capitalism is inimical to our freedom, and why we should instead pursue a novel form of democratic socialism. <br><br>In developing his vision of an emancipated secular life, H�gglund engages with great philosophers from Aristotle to Hegel and Marx, literary writers from Dante to Proust and Knausgaard, political economists from Mill to Keynes and Hayek, and religious thinkers from Augustine to Kierkegaard and Martin Luther King, Jr.<i> This Life</i> gives us new access to our past&#x2014;for the sake of a different future.</p><p><b>MARTIN H�GGLUND</b>&nbsp;is a professor of comparative literature and humanities at Yale University. A member of the Society of Fellows at Harvard University, he is the author of three highly acclaimed books, and his work has been translated into eight languages. In his native Sweden, he published his first book,<i> Chronophobia, </i>at the age of twenty-five. His first book in English, <i>Radical Atheism, </i>was the subject of a conference at Cornell University and a colloquium at Oxford University.

She had entered his life, transformed his world, opened his body and mind. Yet, throughout it all, he had told himself that his devotion to her did not compromise his devotion to God. &#x201c;I had warned myself,&#x201d; he recalls, &#x201c;not to reckon on worldly happiness.&#x201d; But it turns out that this is precisely what he did. He loved her, and because he loved her he is shattered by her death. For days and nights, he records &#x201c;the mad words, the bitter resentment, the fluttering in the stomach, the nightmare unreality, the wallowed-in-tears.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His pious friends tell him to take solace in God and in the words of Saint Paul: &#x201c;Do not mourn like those who have no hope.&#x201d; He comes to understand, however, that &#x201c;what St. Paul says can comfort only those who love God better than the dead.&#x201d; His faith in God would direct him toward an eternal life. But in loving her and in mourning her death, he is not comforted by his faith in God and eternity. He does not want to repose in eternal peace; he wants her to come back and their life together to go on, in the time and space of their shared existence. &#x201c;The earthly beloved,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;incessantly triumphs over your mere idea of her. And you want her to; you want her with all her resistances, all her faults, all her unexpectedness. That is, in her foursquare and independent reality. And this, not any image or memory, is what we are to love still, after she is dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The words belong to C. S. Lewis in his book <i>A Grief Observed, </i>written after the death of his wife, Joy Davidman. While Lewis was one of the most influential Christian writers of his time, <i>A Grief Observed </i>strikes a different tone. Rather than preach or instruct, Lewis seeks to describe what is happening to him in the experience of mourning, as he explores the pain and desperation of losing his beloved. What emerges through this account is not simply a crisis of faith, in the sense that the death of his wife makes him doubt the existence of God. What emerges is something deeper: an insight that his faith in God cannot offer any consolation for the loss of a loved one. If a mother is mourning the death of her child, Lewis writes, &#x201c;she may still hope to &#x2018;glorify God and enjoy him forever,&#x2019; &#x201d; which may be &#x201c;a comfort to the God-aimed, eternal spirit within her. But not to her motherhood. The specifically maternal happiness must be written off. Never, in any place or time, will she have her son on her knees, or bathe him, or tell him a story, or plan for his future, or see her grandchild.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In contrast to his religious faith in eternity, Lewis describes a passionate commitment to a finite life. The mother who is mourn�ing her child, or the lover who is mourning his beloved, is devoted to a relationship that requires time to be what it is. Love is not something that can take place in an instant. Rather, love expresses a commitment to caring for another person across time. The tem�porality of such love is not merely an unavoidable condition; it is intrinsic to the positive qualities of being with the beloved. In loving another, one cherishes a projected future, the repetition of acts, and the ongoing time of living together. It is the end of such a temporal life that one mourns when the beloved is lost. And as Lewis makes clear, the hope for eternity is not a consolation. Even if the hope for eternity were fulfilled, it would not bring back the life they shared together: <br> Suppose that the earthly lives she and I shared for a few years are in reality only the basis for, or prelude to, or earthly appearance of, two unimaginable, supercosmic, eternal somethings. Those somethings could be pictured as spheres or globes. Where the plane of Nature cuts through them&#x2014;that is, in earthly life&#x2014;they appear as two circles (circles are slices of spheres). Two circles that touched. But those two circles, above all the point at which they touched, are the very thing I am mourning for, homesick for, famished for. You tell me, &#x201c;[S]he goes on.&#x201d; But my heart and body are crying out, come back, come back. Be a circle, touching my circle on the plane of Nature. But I know this is impossible. I know that the thing I want is exactly the thing I can never get. The old life, the jokes, the drinks, the arguments, the lovemaking, the tiny, heartbreaking commonplace. On any view whatever, to say, &#x201c;H. is dead,&#x201d; is to say &#x201c;All that is gone.&#x201d; It is a part of the past. And the past is the past and that is what time means, and time itself is one more name for death, and Heaven itself is a state where &#x201c;the former things have passed away. . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Unless, of course, you can literally believe all that stuff about family reunions &#x201c;on the further shore,&#x201d; pictured in entirely earthly terms. But that is all unscriptural, all out of bad hymns and lithographs. There&#x2019;s not a word of it in the Bible.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis here vividly articulates how the attachment to the beloved is expressed through a commitment to <i>living on </i>with her. He cannot come to terms with the death of his wife because he wants their life together to continue, in the temporal rhythm and physical concrete�ness that gave their relationship its unique quality. Accordingly, he does not want them to be self-sufficient, timeless beings (what he describes as &#x201c;two unimaginable, supercosmic, eternal somethings&#x201d;). Rather, he wants them to be in need of each other, vulnerable and open to being transformed by the touch of the other. For the same reason, the promise of an eternal state of being cannot deliver what he desires. In the consummation of eternity&#x2014;here described as a state of heaven where all &#x201c;former things&#x201d; have passed away in favor of eternity&#x2014;there would be no time for their relationship to live on. Eternity would put an end to their time together and in such a state their love could not survive.<br> &nbsp;<br> The commitment to his beloved that animates <i>A Grief Observed </i>is therefore at odds with Lewis&#x2019;s commitment to God. As a long-standing reader of Christian theology, he is well aware that he is not supposed to love mortal beings as ends in themselves but only as means toward the love of God. As he explains in <i>A Grief Observed: </i>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re approaching Him not as the goal but as a road, not as the end but as a means, you&#x2019;re not really approaching Him at all.&#x201d; This is why Lewis emphasizes that the Bible does not support visions of an afterlife that project reunions with the people you have loved throughout your life. Such visions are not directed toward God as the End, but at most treat God as a means for retrieving the mortal beloved. The vision of an afterlife where Lewis&#x2019;s wife would welcome him is attached to living on with the beloved rather than to dwelling in the eternity of God.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lewis thus illuminates my central distinction between <i>living on </i>(prolonging a temporal life) and being <i>eternal </i>(absorbed in a timeless existence). As he makes agonizingly clear, the former cannot be rec�onciled with the latter. In mourning his wife, Lewis loves her as an end in herself. He does not want anything beyond her; he wants her to return and their life as lovers to go on: &#x201c;the jokes, the drinks, the arguments, the lovemaking, the tiny, heartbreaking commonplace.&#x201d; This desire is committed to sharing a life that requires time to be what it is. In wanting his beloved to come back, an eternal life is not only unattainable but also <i>undesirable. </i>He wants their relationship to live on, rather than to be absorbed in an eternal life.<br> &nbsp;<br> One may ask here why the choice between living on and eter�nity has to be an either/or. Many popular conceptions of the after�life assume that living on and being in eternity can be combined, allowing one to keep the positive qualities of life without the threat of losing them. Thus, in response to my argument, the prominent theologian Miroslav Volf has emphasized that Christian visions of eternity are better understood as visions of an <i>endless </i>rather than a <i>timeless </i>existence.8 Volf concedes that a timeless life would be mean�ingless, since there can be no experiences and no events without time. Nevertheless, he maintains that it would be desirable to live forever. In such an eternity, there would still be time, but none of the changes in time would be experienced as a negative loss. Rather, all forms of change would be experienced as an ongoing part of the divine good. The afterlife would thus enable one to live on with the beloved, in an experience of eternity that is untouched by the prospect of tragic loss.<br> &nbsp;<br> My argument, however, is that an endless life is just as mean�ingless as a timeless one. The risk of tragic loss&#x2014;the loss of your own life and the loss of what you love&#x2014;is not a prospect that can be eliminated but an intrinsic part of why it matters what you do with your life. If you and your beloved did not believe that your lives were finite, neither one of you could take your lives to be at stake and there would be no urgency to do anything with your time. You could never care for yourselves, for one another, or for the commit�ment that you share, since you would have no sense of fragility. By the same token, you could feel no need to make an effort on behalf of the relationship, since you would have no apprehension that the other person could leave you or that your relationship could break down. The moments of profound intimacy would not be experienced as precious, but as the given state of things. You would expect every�thing to be settled, rather than dependent on your engagement and attention, as well as on the unforeseeable responses of your beloved. This is why living on with your beloved is incompatible with being in eternity, even on the level of the imagination. As soon as you remove the sense of finitude and vulnerability, you remove the vitality of any possible love relationship.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sense of finitude reverberates in every aspect of your life. In living on, you always remain vulnerable by virtue of leading a temporal life. Living on does not protect you against the regret of having done something irreversible, the pain of not being able to fulfill a given ambition, or the heartbreak of being left by the one you love. Indeed, your world can break down precisely because you live on after the death of everything you love. This &#x201c;death&#x201d; can be much more painful and fearful than the prospect of your own death, not least because it is a death that you have to survive.<br> &nbsp;<br> Hence, as long as you are attached to someone or something that you can lose, you are susceptible to suffering. To attain a peaceful state of eternity you must be liberated from the risk of losing what you love. Were such liberation possible, however, nothing would mat�ter to you. You literally <i>would not care. </i>There would be no urgency to do anything or maintain love for anyone, since nothing of value could be lost. You could not even be motivated to sustain a single activity, since it would not count as a loss for you if you did not engage in the activity.<br> &nbsp;<br> The passion and pathos of living with your beloved are therefore incompatible with the security of an eternal life. The sense of some�thing being unique and irreplaceable is inseparable from the sense that it <i>can </i>be lost. This relation to loss is inscribed in the very form of living on. To live on is never to repose in a timeless or endless presence. Rather, to live on is to remain after a past that has ceased to be and before an unpredictable future that may not come to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> The precarious experience of time is not only a negative peril but also the positive possibility of coming into being, living on, and being motivated to act. The motivation to undertake any form of project&#x2014;to sustain a commitment, to pursue a course of action&#x2014;requires that the project be precarious: that it not be given as a fact but must be upheld by conviction and fidelity. You have to believe in the value of the project, but you also have to believe that the proj�ect may cease to be and needs to be sustained. Thus, when you love someone, that love exists only insofar as you sustain it. Your love is not given as a fact but is something that has to be achieved and&#x2014;once achieved&#x2014;has to be maintained and developed. This project requires that you believe in the value of the love, but it also requires that you believe that the love can be lost and solicits you to care.</p><h2>Ezra And Nehemiah: An Introduction And Commentary (Tyndale Old Testament Commentary Series)</h2><p>&#34;The chequered story of the Kings, a matter of nearly five centuries, had ended disastrously in 587 B.C. with the sack of Jerusalem, the fall of the monarchy and the removal to Babylonia of all that made Judah politically viable. It was a death to make way for a rebirth.&#34; So begins Derek Kidner in this introduction and commentary to the books of Ezra and Nehemiah which chart the Jews&#39; return from exile to Jerusalem and the beginnings of that rebirth.As the drama unfolds, we see how international politics, nationalist pride, wise leadership, political intrigue and opportunism, internal dissension and compromise all shape events. But above all and through all we see the good hand of God at work.</p><p>The works of Derek Kidner (MA, Christ's College, Cambridge) are full of the marks of both professor and pastor with his even�handed scholarship as well as his devotional insight. These qualities have made his commentaries in the Tyndale Old Testament Commentary series and The Bible Speaks Today series some of the most beloved and popular of recent decades. Kidner had a long career in both the church and the academy in England. He studied at Cambridge University and then served in the ministry for several years before becoming a senior tutor at Oak Hill Theological College. Kidner began his writing career while serving as warden of Tyndale House in Cambridge from 1964 to 1978, publishing his ninth and final book, <em>The Message of Jeremiah,</em> in 1987."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A.

She has written for <i>Ms., Essence</i>, and the <i>Village Voice</i>, among other publications.This biography of Audre Lorde, the self-described "black, lesbian, feminist, mother, poet warrior" who died of metastasized breast cancer in 1992, at age 58, captures the complexities of a charismatic figure whose every personal move was indeed political. De Veaux, chair of the women's studies department at SUNY-Buffalo, draws from over 60 of Lorde's unpublished journals as well as testimony from friends and family, though she points out with academic caution in her introduction that this is only a "subjective" story. De Veaux divides her book between Lorde's "two lives," her emergence from a difficult Harlem childhood to a celebrated literary career and, later, her struggle with cancer. Born in 1934 to Caribbean immigrants, Lorde had a persistent, haunting feeling of being an outsider. An early interracial marriage to Ed Rollins brought two children, but Lorde came to find deeper satisfaction in lesbian love, embarking on a decades-long relationship with Frances Clayton and maintaining erotic friendships with activists and poets who informed and shaped her work. By the 1980s, Lorde's writings were internationally recognized, and she continued to articulate her ideas on race, sexuality and gender in groundbreaking ways, eventually bravely documenting her personal experience with breast cancer. This account does not include Lorde's final days, focusing instead on her working years. While De Veaux occasionally slips into academic-speak, she is a skilled biographer, pulling together the contradictory facts of Lorde's public and private personae with ease. Subjective it may be, but Warrior Poet is also a satisfying portrait of a brave life. 16 pages of photos not seen by PW.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Renowned artist Ross's rich, lush, nearly photorealistic style (he painted all the major characters from photographs of models) made his reputation&#x2014;and the book&#x2014;a landmark. The story, too, suggests a sort of grandeur that had largely slipped away from superhero comics by the early '90s, even as it describes the helplessness that normal people might feel in the presence of angel-winged mutants and rapacious gods from outer space. There are plenty of Easter eggs in <i>Marvels</i> for longtime comics buffs, although the book is structured so that new readers won't be lost, either. The level of detail goes much deeper than what's visible on the page, but its creators' command of that unseen background gives the story itself force and resilience. This new edition augments the original with over 200 pages of extras: four drafts of Busiek's original proposal for the series, all of his scripts, a short bonus story, dozens of Ross's sketches and related artwork, and a guide to the many celebrity cameo appearances Ross drew into the original. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Like other forms of massage, you employ a flowing sequence of stretches, but instead of using only your fingers, pressure is applied with thumbs, palms, elbows, knees, and feet. It has been called "yoga in action," with its emphasis on relaxing your mind, restoring your energy, and conditioning your body. A detailed program for complete body massage covers ten lessons, each concentrating on a particular part of your body. Full-color photographs of every move match still shots with superimposed artwork that indicates the directions of the movements you make. Each technique is clearly explained and its benefits detailed. Many have names as calming and as invigorating as the actions: Spiraling Arms, Opening the Energy Gates, Rainbow Dance, Flying Wild Goose, and The Longest Yawn and Stretch in the Universe. More than most massage techniques, Thai massage enhances the bond between partners, with its unity of mind and body, and its harmony of body and body. As you become familiar with the sequences, you'll experience the coming-together of the precise positions and postures to create a cumulative impact. Besides the principal program, there's a section on ways to devise your own approach for addressing specific healing needs such as stress, chronic pain, postural problems, and insomnia.

None of it reached his mind. <p></p> <p></p>Slowly he sat down. Again he clutched his feeder, a spoon-like affair, with sharp edges and little tines projecting from the front curve of the bowl, which could therefore with equal clumsiness cut, scoop and impale. It was enough for a mill-worker. He turned it over and stared without seeing at his number on the back of the handle. He didn&#x2019;t have to see it. He knew it by heart. All the others had registration numbers, just as he had, but the others had names also. He didn&#x2019;t. They called him Rik because it meant something like "moron"in the slang of the kyrt mills. And often enough they called him "Crazy Rik." <p></p> <p></p>But perhaps he would be remembering more and more now. This was the first time since he had come to the mill that he had remembered anything at all from before the beginning. If he thought hard! If he thought with all his mind! <p></p> <p></p>All at once he wasn&#x2019;t hungry; he wasn&#x2019;t the least hungry. With a sudden gesture, he thrust his feeder into the jellied briquet of meat and vegetables before him, pushed the food away, and buried his eyes in the heels of his palms. His fingers thrust and clutched at his hair and painstakingly he tried to follow his mind into the pitch from which it had extracted a single item&#x2014;one muddy, undecipherable item. <p></p> <p></p>Then he burst into tears, just as the clanging bell announced the end of his lunch shift. <p></p> <p></p>Valona March fell in beside him when he left the mill that evening. He was scarcely conscious of her at first, at least as an individual. It was only that he heard his footsteps matched. He stopped and looked at her. Her hair was something between blonde and brown. She wore it in two thick plaits that she clamped together with little magnetized green- stoned pins. They were very cheap pins and had a faded look about them. She wore the simple cotton dress which was all that was needed in that mild climate, just as Rik himself needed only an open, sleeveless shirt and cotton slacks. <p></p> <p></p>She said, "I heard something went wrong lunchtime." <p></p> <p></p>She spoke in the sharp, peasant accents one would expect. Rik&#x2019;s own language was full of flat vowels and had a nasal touch. They laughed at him because of it and imitated his way of speaking, but Valona would tell him that that was only their own ignorance. <p></p> <p></p>Rik mumbled, "Nothing&#x2019;s wrong, Lona." <p></p> <p></p>She persisted. "I heard you said you remembered something. Is that right, Rik?" <p></p> <p></p>She called him Rik too. There wasn&#x2019;t anything else to call him. He couldn&#x2019;t remember his real name. He had tried desperately enough. Valona had tried with him. One day she had obtained a torn city directory somehow and had read all the first names to him. None had seemed more familiar than any other. <p></p> <p></p>He looked her full in the face and said, "I&#x2019;ll have to quit the mill." <p></p> <p></p>Valona frowned. Her round, broad face with its flat, high cheekbones was troubled. "I don&#x2019;t think you can. It wouldn&#x2019;t be right." <p></p> <p></p>"I&#x2019;ve got to find out more about myself." <p></p> <p></p>Valona licked her lips. "I don&#x2019;t think you should." <p></p> <p></p>Rik turned away. He knew her concern to be sincere. She had obtained the mill job for him in the first place. He had had no experience with mill machinery. Or perhaps he had, but just didn&#x2019;t remember. In any case, Lona had insisted that he was too small for manual labor and they had agreed to give him technical training without charge. Before that, in the nightmarish days when he could scarcely make sounds and when he didn&#x2019;t know what food was for, she had watched him and fed him. She had kept him alive. <p></p> <p></p>He said, "I&#x2019;ve got to." <p></p> <p></p>"Is it the headaches again, Rik?" <p></p> <p></p>"No. I really remember something. I remember what my job was before&#x2014;&#x2014;Before!" <p></p> <p></p>He wasn&#x2019;t sure he wanted to tell her. He looked away. The warm, pleasant sun was at least two hours above the horizon. The monotonous rows of workers&#x2019; cubicles that stretched out and round the mills were tiresome to look at, but Rik knew that as soon as they topped the rise the field would lie before them in all the beauty of crimson and gold. <p></p> <p></p>He liked to look at the fields. From the very first the sight had soothed and pleased him. Even before he knew that the colors were crimson and gold, before he knew that there were such things as colors, before he could express his plea sure in anything more than a soft gurgle, the headaches would flicker away faster in the fields. In those days Valona would borrow a diamagnetic scooter and take him out of the village every idle-day. They would skim along, a foot above the road, gliding on the cushioned smoothness of the counter- gravity field, until they were miles and miles away from any human habitation and there would be left only the wind against his face, fragrant with the kyrt blossoms. <p></p> <p></p>They would sit beside the road then, surrounded by color and scent, and between them share a food briquet, while the sun glowed down upon them until it was time to return again. <p></p> <p></p>Rik was stirred by the memory. He said, "Let&#x2019;s go to the fields, Lona." <p></p> <p></p>"It&#x2019;s late." <p></p> <p></p>"Please. Just outside town." <p></p> <p></p>She fumbled at the thin money pouch she kept between herself and the soft blue leather belt she wore, the only luxury of dress she allowed herself. <p></p> <p></p>Rik caught her arm. "Let&#x2019;s walk." <p></p> <p></p>They left the highway for the winding, dustless, packed- sand roads half an hour later. There was a heavy silence between them and Valona felt a familiar fear clutching at her. She had no words to express her feelings for him, so she had never tried. <p></p> <p></p>What if he should leave her? He was a little fellow, no taller than herself and weighing somewhat less, in fact. He was still like a helpless child in many ways. But before they had turned his mind off he must have been an educated man. A very important educated man. <p></p> <p></p>Valona had never had any education besides reading and writing and enough trade- school technology to be able to handle mill machinery, but she knew enough to know that all people were not so limited. There was the Townman, of course, whose great knowledge was so helpful to all of them. Occasionally Squires came on inspection tours. She had never seen them close up but once, on a holiday, she had visited the City and seen a group of incredibly gorgeous creatures at a distance. Occasionally the mill-workers were allowed to listen to what educated people sounded like. They spoke differently, more fluently, with longer words and softer tones. Rik talked like that more and more as his memory improved. <p></p> <p></p>She had been frightened at his first words. They came so suddenly after long whimpering over a headache. They were pronounced queerly. When she tried to correct him he wouldn&#x2019;t change. <p></p> <p></p>Even then she had been afraid that he might remember too much and then leave her. She was only Valona March. They called her Big Lona. She had never married. She never would. A large, big- footed girl with work- reddened hands like herself could never marry. She had never been able to do more than look at the boys with dumb resentment when they ignored her at the idle- day dinner festivals. She was too big to giggle and smirk at them. <p></p> <p></p>She would never have a baby to cuddle and hold. The other girls did, one after the other, and she could only crowd about for a quick glimpse of something red and hairless with screwed-up eyes, fists impotently clenched, gummy mouth&#x2014;&#x2014; <p></p> <p></p>"It&#x2019;s your turn next, Lona." <p></p> <p></p>"When will you have a baby, Lona?" <p></p> <p></p>She could only turn away. <p></p> <p></p>But when Rik had come, he was like a baby. He had to be fed and taken care of, brought out into the sun, soothed to sleep when the headaches racked him. <p></p> <p></p>The children would run after her, laughing. They would yell, "Lona&#x2019;s got a boy friend. Big Lona&#x2019;s got a crazy boy...</p><h2>A Fatal Thaw (A Kate Shugak Mystery)</h2><p>When a man goes berserk on the first day of spring and kills nine people, Kate Shugak, once the star of the Anchorage D.A.&#39;s office, begins an investigation</p><p>Dana Stabenow is the Edgar Award-winning author of <b>Fire and Ice, So Sure of Death</b>, and several other acclaimed mysteries. She lives in Anchorage, Alaska.Stabenow's ( A Cold Day for Murder ) writing has matured in her second effort featuring native Alaskan sleuth Kate Shugak. The Alaskan terrain and native culture add texture--the narrative includes both a potlatch celebration and an avalanche. Spring brings not only a thaw to the Alaskan wilderness, but a mass murderer. Roger McAniff cracks along with the ice on the first day of spring and goes on a killing spree, murdering nine and wounding two others. Or so it seems until ballistics tests prove that one of the victims, Lisa Getty, was killed by a different rifle. Shugak's investigation reconstructs Getty's life, uncovering her promiscuity, drug-dealing and endangered species-poaching, but all those leads prove false. The investigation reintroduces readers to some of the most intriguing characters from Shugak's previous mystery, including wheelchair-bound black veteran Bobby Clark and Shugak's manipulative grandmother, Ekaterina. Meanwhile, the tension level rises when a park ranger is killed and Shugak herself is wounded by a sniper's rifle, and Stabenow succuessfully sustains the tension until the killer is found. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Paved With Good Intentions: The Failure of Race Relations in Contemporary America</h2><p>Examines the reasons for the ongoing tension in America and criticizes government programs for isolating and alienating Blacks</p><p>Jared Taylor born in Japan, where he lived until age sixteen. He received a BA in Philosophy from Yale University in 1973 and an MA in international economics from the Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris in 1978.

Ranging through studies and press accounts, Taylor effectively catalogues numerous black excesses in the name of solidarity (such as jurors' defenses of former D.C. mayor Marion Barry, ultimately convicted of one charge--possession of cocaine--of 14 brought against him); he notes that blacks commit far more interracial violent crimes than whites do; he criticizes "race-norming" in employment tests; and he dissects studies concluding that police are more likely to shoot blacks (instances of shootings, he argues, are in fact proportionate to arrests for violent crime). But Taylor, who is white, too easily dismisses the notion of institutional racism; he simplistically argues that Asian achievements prove that American racism is not so great an obstacle to success; and he can't understand the role of black-only organizations. Arguing that the problem of the underclass is mainly a moral one, Taylor disregards economics. Instead, he calls for get-tough police practices, favors mandatory, no-appeal death sentences for drug dealers and suggests that to combat "reckless procreation" the government should require female welfare recipients to use the contraceptive Norplant. His blurred distinctions between the "underclass" and blacks reveal his biases. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Herb Garden Design</h2><p>Discusses the fundamental concerns in the design of an herb garden and suggests designs for herb gardens in a variety of styles</p><p>8 1/2 x 11 trim. 51 two-color plans. 11 illus. 44 figs.

Her cropped yellow-blonde hair stuck out like demented sunrays, and her pink-and-blue Oilily sweater and jeans clashed with her bright red clogs. Worst of all was her expression, easy to read on a face as flat as an artist&#x2019;s palette, with troubled blue eyes set wide over a small nose and thin lips pressed unhappily together.</p> <p>Judy tried to shake off her bad mood when the elevator halted and the doors slid open with a <i>ping</i>. ROSATO &amp; DINUNZIO, LLC, read the shiny brass plaque, and she crossed the reception area, empty of clients on a Saturday morning. The office was quiet, but Judy knew she wouldn&#x2019;t be the only one in, because lawyers regarded weekends as a chance to work uninterrupted, which was their version of relaxing.</p> <p>She heard her cell phone ringing and slid it from her pocket because she&#x2019;d been playing phone tag with a client, Linda Adler. She checked the screen, but it read &#x201c;Mom calling,&#x201d; with a faceless blue shadow. Judy had never bothered to put in a profile picture for her mother because the shadow seemed oddly perfect. Judy had grown up a Navy brat, but her family never developed the us-against-the-world closeness of a typical military family. The Carriers moved, skied, and hiked together, but their activities were a sort of parallel play for adults, and now they scattered all over the globe and emailed each other photos of themselves moving, skiing, and hiking. Judy clicked IGNORE and returned the phone to her pocket.</p> <p>She rounded the corner to the hallway and brightened at the sight of her best friend, Mary DiNunzio, who turned when she spotted Judy and came hustling down the hall toward her, grinning from ear to ear. Mary had recently made partner, becoming Judy&#x2019;s boss, but neither of them knew how that would play out over time. Judy avoided thinking about it, and in any event, Mary made the most adorable boss ever in her tortoiseshell glasses, navy sweater, jeans, and loafers, with her little legs churning and her light brown ponytail bouncing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Judy, I was waiting for you! I have great news!&#x201d; Mary reached her, light brown eyes warm with anticipation.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hi, cutie, tell me.&#x201d; Judy entered her office, and Mary followed her excitedly inside.</p> <p>&#x201c;Actually, I have great news and even greater news. Which do you want first?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The great news. We&#x2019;ll start slow.&#x201d; Judy slid her woven purse from her shoulder, tossed it onto the credenza, and went around to her chair. She sat down behind a desk cluttered with a laptop, case correspondence, a Magic 8 ball, ripped Splenda packets, and an empty can of Diet Coke. Law books, case reporters, notes, and files stuffed her bookshelves. She was going for creative clutter, but lately worried she was entering hoarder territory.</p> <p>&#x201c;First, I have breaking wedding news.&#x201d; Mary leaned back against the credenza, flushed with happiness. &#x201c;You remember I told you about that high-end salon, J&#x2019;taime?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Judy was going to be maid of honor at Mary&#x2019;s wedding, though she&#x2019;d never been in a bridal party before. She was studying by watching bride shows on cable, but none of them told her that being maid of honor was like being executor of a vast and complicated estate, without the fee.</p> <p>&#x201c;They had a cancellation, so I got an appointment next Friday night! How great is that? Can you come?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Judy had already been to two bridal shops and seen Mary try on a zillion wedding dresses, but they all looked the same to her, like vanilla soft-serve without the cone.</p> <p>&#x201c;They have Vera Wang and all the big names.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Cool!&#x201d; Judy kept her smile in place, but wondered why she felt so negative, the Debbie Downer of bridesmaids. She wasn&#x2019;t jealous that Mary was getting married, but she wished she had what Mary had, which wasn&#x2019;t the same thing. It was more that Mary was moving forward, already a partner and soon a wife, while Judy got left behind, stuck. Judy didn&#x2019;t know how to get herself to the next level or what she was doing wrong. She&#x2019;d always been on top, earned the best grades at school and succeeded at work. But now she sensed she was blowing her lead, at life.</p> <p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mind going to a third shop, do you? My mother will be there.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Great!&#x201d; Judy answered, meaning it, since she was closer to Mary&#x2019;s mother than her own. The DiNunzios were warm and loving South Philly Italians, so they&#x2019;d practically adopted her, whereupon she&#x2019;d permanently gained ten pounds.</p> <p>&#x201c;The only problem is that I put a deposit on the veil at David&#x2019;s Bridal, and I can&#x2019;t know if it will go with the dresses at J&#x2019;taime. But if I lose the money, so what?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Right, it wasn&#x2019;t that expensive,&#x201d; Judy said, though she&#x2019;d forgotten how much the veil cost. The answer was, probably, a fortune. She&#x2019;d learned that everything associated with weddings cost the same&#x2014;a fortune.</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay, now to the even greater news.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;More wedding updates?&#x201d; Judy braced herself to hear the latest drama with the DJ, the menu, the reception hall, the church, the invitations, or Mary&#x2019;s future mother-in-law, Elvira Rotunno, whom they called El Virus.</p> <p>&#x201c;No, this is about work.&#x201d; Mary cleared her throat, brimming with renewed enthusiasm. &#x201c;Bennie told me to tell you, since she&#x2019;s in trial prep, that she just got a major piece of business and she&#x2019;s assigning it to you! Girl, you&#x2019;ll be a partner in no time!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Judy said, but she felt caught up short. She and Mary never referred to the fact that Judy was still an associate, tacitly saving her face, as if she didn&#x2019;t know her own employment status. &#x201c;Great, what kind of case is it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not one case, it&#x2019;s <i>seventy-five.</i>&#x201d; Mary beamed. &#x201c;Bennie got them in as referral business from Singer Crenheim in Manhattan. The big league!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why are there so many cases?&#x201d; Judy didn&#x2019;t get it. &#x201c;What are they about?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the only bummer.&#x201d; Mary paused. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re asbestos cases, defense side, representing a company called Bendaflex.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh no.&#x201d; Judy groaned in dismay. &#x201c;Nobody likes asbestos cases, even asbestos firms.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Judy, these cases will generate <i>millions</i> in fees.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;ll take two or three years to try.&#x201d; Judy was trying to process the information, which struck her as lawyer hell.</p> <p>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t take that long because you don&#x2019;t have to try the whole case, just the damages phase. The liability was already decided.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Even worse,&#x201d; Judy said, aghast. Mass tort trials like asbestos were often bifurcated, which meant that the question of liability was separated from the question of damages. Evidently, their new client Bendaflex had lost on liability, so there were a slew of individual damage cases that had to be tried. Literally the cases were damage control. &#x201c;How did Bennie get these, anyway?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The cases were consolidated in the Southern District of New York, then remanded back to the various states for damages trials. She got all of the Pennsylvania cases, and most of them came out of the Navy Yard.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;For real?&#x201d; Judy didn&#x2019;t think it could get worse. &#x201c;My father was a lieutenant commander in the Navy, remember? He used to tell me about how there was asbestos all over those ships, in every shipyard in the country. Anything hot was insulated with asbestos, mainly pipes. Grinders would grind the old asbestos off, and pipe fitters blew the new asbestos on.&#x201d; Judy remembered her father&#x2019;s anger, and guilt, when he&#x2019;d told her the stories, even though nobody knew that asbestos was deadly back then. &#x201c;These poor guys, they&#x2019;d be standing in the hull of a ship, sweating their butts off in a <i>snowglobe</i> of asbestos. No masks, no ventilation, no nothing. They&#x2019;re all dead now of mesothelioma. Johns Manville declared bankruptcy, and other companies, like Bendaflex, are fighting not to pay what they owe, decades later. And I&#x2019;m supposed to help? Is this why I became a lawyer?&#x201d;</p> <p>Mary&#x2019;s smile faded. &#x201c;I hear you, but we&#x2019;re lucky to get that much business in this economy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not worth it. The cases don&#x2019;t even present a legal question, only how much damages each plaintiff is owed, and since we represent Bendaflex, the answer has to be, as little as possible.&#x201d; Judy flashed-forward, disgusted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to argue down the value of a man&#x2019;s life, probably in front of his widow and his children.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mary sighed.</p> <p>&#x201c;My argument will have to be that the plaintiff, who&#x2019;s dead, wasn&#x2019;t going to earn that much, because, after all, he wasn&#x2019;t good enough to earn a promotion. And as far as pain and suffering, don&#x2019;t pay him for that because he died within a year, so he didn&#x2019;t suffer that long. Too bad he was only forty-three.&#x201d;</p> <p>Mary frowned, sympathetic. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to try the cases yourself, just supervise them. With the money that comes in, you can hire whoever you need.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Still.&#x201d; Judy fought a rising tension in her chest. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t want to do it, would you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t even if I wanted to.&#x201d; Mary shook her head, her tone turning defensive. &#x201c;The cases came to Bennie, and she assigned them to you. I can&#x2019;t countermand her, as her partner.&#x201d;</p> <p>Judy felt a twinge that Mary was taking Bennie&#x2019;s side, but she should have known it would happen, someday. Mary and Bennie were the sole partners of this all-woman firm, and nobody in her right mind opposed Bennie Rosato. Bennie was a world-class trial lawyer who&#x2019;d grown the firm to national prominence and she hadn&#x2019;t reached the top by being a creampuff. On the contrary, the woman owned a coffee mug that read I CAN SMELL FEAR.</p> <p>Suddenly, there was a commotion outside Judy&#x2019;s office, and they turned their attention to the door. Judy&#x2019;s boyfriend, Frank Lucia, materialized in the threshold, flashing the easy, confident grin that was one of the reasons she&#x2019;d fallen in love with him. He&#x2019;d been out of town last night, and she still got a thrill out of seeing him, especially looking so handsome in his puffy black jacket, tie-and-work-shirt combo, and jeans.</p> <p>&#x201c;Frank, what a surprise!&#x201d; Judy said, brightening.</p> <p>&#x201c;I had to stay over in Baltimore and I missed my girl, so I thought I&#x2019;d take her out to breakfast!&#x201d; Frank burst into the office, threw open his big arms, and bounded around the desk, gathering Judy up and hugging her. &#x201c;How you doing, babe?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Judy felt a warm rush of love, breathing in his familiar smells of aftershave and mortar dust. Frank was a smart, straight-up Italian hunk who owned a successful specialty masonry company, and they&#x2019;d lived together for the past few years.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go eat, I&#x2019;m starved.&#x201d; Frank raked big fingers through his thick, wavy hair, the same espresso-brown as his large, bright eyes.</p> <p>Mary beamed. &#x201c;What a guy! Frank, you have to teach Anthony to surprise me sometimes. He&#x2019;s not exactly spontaneous.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ha! Ditch him at the altar, Mare. I&#x2019;ll hook you up with one of my boys!&#x201d;</p> <p>Mary grinned. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s your hand? Did you get the cast off?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all good, I only have this thing now.&#x201d; Frank showed his left hand, and a black cloth brace peeked from his sleeve. He grabbed Judy&#x2019;s arm. &#x201c;Babe, let&#x2019;s get out of here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Judy let Frank pull her up, but her gaze fell on her desk clock, which read 10:15, and she remembered something. &#x201c;Wait, how are you in town this early? Did you drop off the dog at the vet&#x2019;s? You said you would.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ruh-roh.&#x201d; Frank&#x2019;s grin turned sheepish. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What do you mean?&#x201d; Judy stopped. &#x201c;She had to get flea-dipped. Did you take her or not?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I forgot.&#x201d; Frank shrugged. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, honestly.&#x201d; Judy felt disappointed, but not completely surprised. She had been trying to figure out whether Frank was marriage material, and she was starting to worry she had an answer. &#x201c;I just washed the sheets, the comforter, and the towels I put on top of the couch and chairs.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the end of the world.&#x201d; Frank glanced at Mary, and Judy knew that he hated to fight, especially in front of anyone. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get her dipped tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re closed on Sunday.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No worries, we&#x2019;ll do it on Monday.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s too late.&#x201d; Judy had explained this to him ten times, but she couldn&#x2019;t seem to make him hear her. &#x201c;Remember, we have to treat the house and the dog simultaneously? There can&#x2019;t be any delay.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay, we&#x2019;ll treat them both, then. What&#x2019;s the big deal?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But you didn&#x2019;t drop her off, so that means that I have to wash everything all over again on Sunday night, if we want to drop her off on Monday.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Would you rather me go home and try to take the dog in now, instead of taking you to breakfast?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Honestly, yes. The dog has to get dipped, and I have to work. I would really appreciate that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay, fine.&#x201d; Frank rolled his eyes and waved a cranky good-bye. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll do it your way. See you later. Bye, Mary.&#x201d;</p> <p>Judy and Mary held each other&#x2019;s gaze for a moment then Judy shrugged. &#x201c;What am I supposed to do? That was the right decision, wasn&#x2019;t it? Things have to get done but he wants to play all the time.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I think he was trying to do a nice thing, but I totally get where you are coming from.&#x201d;</p> <p>Suddenly Judy&#x2019;s phone started ringing, and she slipped it from her pocket in case it was Linda Adler. But it was her aunt Barb calling, and the phone screen came to life with a candid photo of her adored aunt, her mother&#x2019;s younger sister. &#x201c;Excuse me, let me get this, it&#x2019;s Aunt Barb.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Tell her I said hi,&#x201d; Mary said, because everybody loved Aunt Barb. She lived about an hour away, in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, and they&#x2019;d all been out to her house for beer and barbecue. Last year, Judy&#x2019;s uncle Steve, Barb&#x2019;s husband, had passed, and the whole office had gone to his funeral.</p> <p>&#x201c;Aunt Barb, hi, how are you?&#x201d; Judy answered the call, realizing that she hadn&#x2019;t seen her aunt in a few months, though they talked on the phone all the time.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hello, honey,&#x201d; her aunt said, and Judy knew immediately that something was wrong. Her aunt sounded grave, when she was usually so warm and happy.</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Am I catching you at a bad time?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, why? What&#x2019;s the matter, Aunt Barb?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t your mom call you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, but I was busy.&#x201d; Judy&#x2019;s mind raced. She regretted ignoring that call from her mother. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on? Is Mom okay?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, your mom&#x2019;s fine. In fact, she&#x2019;s here at the house with me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Judy asked, surprised. Her parents lived in Santa Barbara, and her mother rarely visited her or Aunt Barb, and never unannounced.</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d love it if you could come out today, too, if you&#x2019;re not busy.&#x201d;</p> <p>Judy&#x2019;s mouth went dry. Something was up. &#x201c;Sure, okay, but why? What&#x2019;s the matter?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll talk about it when you come, sweetie.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Tell me.&#x201d; Judy swallowed hard. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;</p> <p>Aunt Barb hesitated. &#x201c;Are you sitting down?&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Smart Blonde, LLC</p></p><h2>The Complete Book Of Woodworking</h2><p>This is the ultimate step-by-step guide to essential woodworking skills, techniques, tools, and tips.

With high hopes he and three colleagues start a new detective agency, the first of its kind. But as the months pass, and he is the only detective who cannot find work, Lenox begins to question whether he can still play the game as he once did.</p><p>Then comes a chance to redeem himself, though at a terrible price: a friend, a member of Scotland Yard, is shot near Regent's Park. As Lenox begins to parse the peculiar details of the death &#x2013; an unlaced boot, a days-old wound, an untraceable luggage ticket &#x2013; he realizes that the incident may lead him into grave personal danger, beyond which lies a terrible truth.</p><p>With all the humanity, glamor, and mystery that readers have come to love, the latest Lenox novel is a shining new confirmation of the enduring popularity of Charles Finch's Victorian series.</p></p><p><p><b>Charles Finch</b> is a graduate of Yale and Oxford. He is the author of the Charles Lenox mysteries. His first novel, <i>A Beautiful Blue Death</i>, was nominated for an Agatha Award and was named one of Library Journal's Best Books of 2007, one of only five mystery novels on the list. He lives in Chicago.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A late winter&#x2019;s night in London: the city hushed; the last revelers half an hour in their beds; a new snow softening every dull shade of gray and brown into angelic whiteness. For a quarter of an hour nobody passed down the narrow street. Such emptiness in this great capital seemed impossible, uncanny, and after a few moments of deep stillness the regular row of houses, covered so evenly by the snowfall, began to lose their shape and identity, to look as if they had nothing at all to do with mankind, but instead belonged to the outer edge of some low, lightless canyon upon a plain, in a distant and lonely and less civilized time.</p><p>Watching from the window of his unlit second-story perch across the way, Charles Lenox began to feel like an intruder upon the scene. In his experience there was a ten-minute period like this lying beyond every London midnight, though its actual time was unpredictable&#x2014;after the last day had ended, before the next day had begun.</p><p>Just as his pocket watch softly chimed for five o&#x2019;clock, however, the human stir returned to Chiltern Street. Abruptly a hunched figure in a dark coat strode past, heading south, and not long afterward the first fire of the day appeared in a low window, a small stubborn orange glow in the darkness. Soon another followed it, three houses down. Lenox wondered who the man had been, whether he was out especially late or especially early, whether his errand was one of mischief or mercy. He had been dressed respectably. A doctor, perhaps. Then again, perhaps not, for he hadn&#x2019;t been carrying the handled leather bag of that breed. A priest? A burglar? Few other professions called for a man to be awake at such an hour.</p><p>Of course, Lenox&#x2019;s was one of them. He was a private detective&#x2014;lying in wait, at this moment, for a murderer.</p><p>Across the street, the light of another fire in its hearth. Now the day was very near beginning. Lenox thought of all the maids of London&#x2014;his own included&#x2014;who woke during the brutal chill of this hour to begin their chores, to light the fires. Then he thought of his wife, Lady Jane Lenox, and their young daughter, Sophia, asleep six streets away, and with a shiver pulled his coat tighter around him. The room where he had waited all night didn&#x2019;t have a fire, since of course he didn&#x2019;t want the light of one to draw attention to his presence here. What a queer way to make a living it was, detection. He smiled. It did make him happy. Even in moments of discomfort.</p><p>Not long before, his life had been very different. It was early January of the year 1876 now; only in October had he finally, after seven years of toil, given up his seat in Parliament. During the last ten months of that period he had been a Junior Lord of the Treasury, drawing a salary of nearly two thousand pounds a year (to some men a very great fortune indeed, in a city where one could live opulently on a tenth of that sum), and it had even been dangled before him that he might, with continued industry and luck, hope one day to compete for a very high office&#x2014;indeed so high an office that one could scarcely utter its name without a feeling of awe. Even on a humbler level he might have remained useful in Parliament indefinitely, he knew. He had both an interest in and a talent for politics, and the discipline that success in that House required.</p><p>But during every hour of those seven years he had missed&#x2014;well, had missed this, the previous work of his life, his vocation, detection, and while the evenings in Parliament had been comfortable, with their beer and chops and amicable companions, they had given him nothing like the thrill of this cold, wearying night. He was where he belonged again: doing what he was most suited to do. It might puzzle the members of his caste (for Lenox was a gentleman, and nearing the age of fifty more rapidly than he would have preferred), but this disreputable line of work gave him greater pleasure than all the authorities and appanages of Parliament ever could. He did not regret going into politics, having long wished to try his hand at the game of it; still less though did he regret leaving the game behind.</p><p>The first carriage of the morning passed down Chiltern Street. Nearly every house had a fire lit below stairs now, in the servants&#x2019; quarters, and in one there was a second bright flicker of heat a story up, where Lenox could see that the head of the family had risen and was taking his early breakfast. A stockbroker, perhaps. They often had to be in the City by seven.</p><p>Another fire, and another.</p><p>Only one house remained dark. It was directly across the street from Lenox&#x2019;s window, and his gaze was focused steadily upon it. Surely the time was coming, he thought. When another carriage rolled down the street he followed its progress intently, before observing that there was a coat of arms on its door. That lost the vehicle his interest. He doubted that his quarry would arrive in such a conspicuous conveyance.</p><p>Another fire. Another carriage. The sky was growing faintly lighter, the absolute darkness of the sky lessening into a black lavender. Soon enough it would be daytime. Perhaps he had been wrong, he felt with a first hint of unease. He was out of practice, after all.</p><p>But then it came: an anonymous gig, a pair of thick-glassed oil lamps swinging from its hood, pulled steadily through the snow by a youthful gray horse.</p><p>It stopped a few houses shy of the one Lenox was observing, and a man stepped down from it, passing a few coins to its driver, who received them with a hand to the brim of his cap and then whipped the horse hard, in haste to be on his way to another fare. Or home, perhaps, who knew. Lenox&#x2019;s eyes were fixed on the person who had dismounted. Certainly it was he. Hughes: Hughes the blackmailer, Hughes the thief, above all Hughes the murderer.</p><p>He was a very small fellow, not more than an inch or two higher than five foot. He was well made, however, with a handsome face and brilliantly shining dark hair. He carried a cloth case with a hard handle.</p><p>Lenox reached up above his right shoulder and gave the taut white string there one hard, decisive pull. He let it quiver for a moment and then stilled it with his hand. His heart was in his throat as he watched the criminal, to see if the man would fly&#x2014;but Hughes continued without any hesitation toward the last dim house in Chiltern Street, the one Lenox had been watching. When he was at the door he peered at the handle for a moment, then opened his case and chose two or three items from it. He set to work on the lock. In what seemed a breathtakingly short time, not more than four or five seconds, he had the door open. It was the skill of a great criminal. He put his tools away quickly and walked inside with quiet steps, closing the door behind him. The house remained dark.</p><p>Lenox stood and smiled. He counted fifteen seconds and then walked toward the door of the room in which he had been sitting most of the night, careful to avoid moving past the windows, where his silhouette might be seen. His joints ached. His eyes felt at once tired and alive with alertness. It wouldn&#x2019;t be more than a moment now.</p><p>It was frigidly cold down on the street, and he was thankful, as he stepped into the snow on the pavement, for his rather odd-looking brown cork-soled boots, which he had ordered specially because they kept out the damp. The rest of his dress was more formal, his daytime attire: a dark suit, pale shirt, dark tie, dark hat, the only gleam of brightness on his person coming from the silver of the watch chain that extended across his slender midsection. He lit a small cigar, put a hand in his pocket, and stood to watch, his curious hazel eyes trained across the street.</p><p>&#x201c;Come along, quickly,&#x201d; he said to himself under his breath. Chiltern Street was growing busier. Two carriages passed in quick succession.</p><p>Then suddenly the brick house opposite&#x2014;the one into which Hughes had slipped so quietly&#x2014;burst from stillness into commotion. A dozen lamps blazed to life, and a dozen voices to match them. When Lenox heard an aggrieved shout, he smiled. It was done. Hughes was captured. He dropped his cigar into the snow, stamped it out with his foot, and then, looking up and down the street to make sure no more carriages were coming, stepped briskly across to witness his victory at firsthand.</p><p>Thirty minutes later Hughes was secured in the back of one of the two wagons from Scotland Yard that stood on Chiltern Street. Enough people were awake and about that a small crowd had gathered nearby, their curiosity triumphing over the cold. Lenox was outside the house with Inspector Nicholson, a tall, bony, hook-nosed young man with a winning grin, which he wore now.</p><p>&#x201c;He took the money in addition to the letters. Couldn&#x2019;t resist it, I suppose. Greedy chap.&#x201d; The dozen pound notes sitting alongside the letters in the desk had been Lenox&#x2019;s idea&#x2014;their theft would make Hughes&#x2019;s crime easier to prosecute. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need them for evidence, but you&#x2019;ll have them back in a month or two. Along with the rope and the bell.&#x201d;</p><p>Lenox looked up at the thin string toward which Nicholson gestured as he said this, hard to discern unless you were looking for it. It ran tightly overhead from one side of the street to the other; Lenox had used its bell to warn the constables waiting in the Dwyer house, the one that Hughes had entered, in case the thief was armed. Certainly he had shown time and again that he was not above violence. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no rush at all about the money,&#x201d; said Lenox, returning Nicholson&#x2019;s smile. &#x201c;Though I&#x2019;m afraid I must be off now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course. The agency?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Our official opening.&#x201d;</p><p>When Lenox had left Parliament, he had agreed to a proposal from his prot�g�, Lord John Dallington, to begin a detective agency&#x2014;a venture that he had contemplated at first with reservations, but that filled him increasingly now with excitement. It would be the best in London. The founders were determined of that.</p><p>The young inspector extended a hand. He was one of the few men at the Yard who didn&#x2019;t look upon the new agency with territorial suspicion, or indeed outright disdain. &#x201c;I wish you only the very best of luck. Though we&#x2019;ll miss the help you&#x2019;ve given us over the last months, of course. Six of the seven names.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Some scores to settle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And not bad publicity, I imagine.&#x201d;</p><p>Lenox smiled. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;</p><p>It was true. Lenox had devoted the months of November and December to tracking down some of the old criminals whose freedom had rankled in his bosom, when Parliament had deprived him of the time to try to take it from them. Now the press that would gather in Chancery Lane an hour hence to take photographs and write articles about the agency&#x2019;s opening would have a ready-made angle: Lenox&#x2019;s return to detection prosecuted with single-minded determination over the past months, and resulting already in a safer London. It would bring in business, they hoped.</p><p>What a day of promise! Hughes in a cell, his partners waiting for him, the brass plate upon their door&#x2014;which read LENOX, DALLINGTON, STRICKLAND, AND LEMAIRE&#x2014;ready to be uncovered. Hopefully the broken window of yesterday had been mended; hopefully the office was tidied, ready for the eyes of the press. How right it had been to leave Parliament, he saw now! A new year. The energy one drew from embarking upon a new challenge, a new adventure. He walked briskly down the street, too happy with life to worry about the cold.</p><p>Had he known how miserable he would be in three months&#x2019; time, he would have shaken his head bitterly at that misplaced enthusiasm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Copyright � 2014 by Charles Finch</p></p><h2>Kit Story Collection (American Girl)</h2><p>Girls can enjoy all six beloved Kit stories in one keepsake volume.

Reprint.</p><p>Joan Lowery Nixon was the author of more than 130 books for young readers and was the only four-time winner of the Edgar Allan Poe Best Young Adult Mystery Award. She received the award for&nbsp;<i>The Kidnapping of Christina Lattimore</i>,&nbsp;<i>The S�ance</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Name of the Game Was Murder</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Other Side of the Dark</i>, which also won the California Young Reader Medal. Her historical fiction included the award-winning series The Orphan Train Adventures, Orphan Train Children, and Colonial Williamsburg: Young Americans.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Grade 4-8-The Civil War is raging and Mike Kelly, 12, who came to the Midwest on an orphan train, runs away from home with his friend Todd to join the Union Army. As musicians in the Second Kansas Infantry, they make a long and difficult march into Missouri, where they encounter General McCulloch's Missouri Guard at the arduous Battle of Wilson's Creek. Mike is wounded and left for dead; Todd is brutally killed. Mike looks on in agony while a man takes an heirloom pocket watch from his friend's body-he'd promised Todd he'd return it to his sister if anything ever happened to him. He is rescued by a Confederate soldier-someone he'd known on the orphan train-and eventually rejoins his regiment and has several adventures and close calls with Confederate sympathizers along the way. His overriding mission, however, is to retrieve Todd's watch. Nixon writes energetically and maintains an aura of adventure and danger. She clearly portrays the horrors of war, and the particular agony of this war. Her characters are finely drawn and multifaceted, the plot is lively, and the details are well chosen.

However, THE ROAD OF THE PATRIARCH is a bit more adult than the usual fare from this author. This is a gritty and bloody book, with a bit of sex as well, and is third in a series that follows the human Artemis Entreri and the elf Jaraxle Baenre, who are fresh from a previous adventure and on their way to a future one. From the hearty belly laugh of a dwarf to the dangerous elegance of a dark elf, Colacci keeps this fast-paced fantasy interesting.

Each generation has reimagined Charlotte, Emily, and Anne in ways that reflect changing visions&#x2014;of the role of the woman writer or of sexuality or of the very concept of personality. Charlotte Bront� has been seen as domestic saint, as sex-starved hysteric, as ambitious literary careerist. Her sister Emily has been furnished with apocryphal lovers of both sexes; has even been denied the authorship of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> by conspiracy theorists who attribute it to her brother, Branwell.<br><br>Now Lucasta Miller, in <i>The Bront� Myth,</i> shows us how the Bront�s became cultural symbols almost as soon as their novels were published; how they became notorious even before the veil dropped from their carefully chosen pseudonyms, as Charlotte&#x2019;s <i>Jane Eyre</i> and Emily&#x2019;s <i>Wuthering Heights,</i> appearing out of nowhere, instantly fascinated, inspired, and scandalized English readers.<br><br>The subsequent discovery that Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell were three youngish spinsters&#x2014; parson&#x2019;s daughters&#x2014;living rural lives of utmost propriety made interest in the sisters obsessive. Add a supposedly ferocious father and untimely death, to say nothing of the Victorian penchant for seeing noble sacrifice in every possible situation, and the production of legends multiplied. <br><br>Lucasta Miller provides fascinating insight into the manufacture of cultural myth and how it can distort our memory of the artist even as it obscures the art. She traces the reinterpretations, indeed re-creations, of the Bront�s, from Charlotte&#x2019;s own efforts to soften her dead sisters&#x2019; reputations and Mrs. Gaskell&#x2019;s classic portrait of the artists as exemplary Christian ladies to the fashionably Freudian psychobiographies of the 1920s and &#x2019;30s, from counterfeit memorabilia and the promotion of literary tourism to Hollywood representations of gloomy heroines on savage windswept moors. She rescues the Bront�s from their admirers and attackers, giving us back three vivid women who, with little formal education, were writing in the days when few women dared to try: geniuses and sisters who, in the words of a household witness in the late 1850s, were &#x201c;as cheerful and full of spirits as possible.... full of fun and merriment.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>&#x201c;A brilliant and riveting examination of the Bront� phenomenon.&#x201d; &#x2013; <i>Daily Mail</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;A sharp-witted study in literary reputation...

Contemporary readers can still appreciate the powerful effects of its melodramatic characterizations and its unapologetic sentimentality. They can also recognize in its treatment of racial violence some of the brooding imagination and realism that anticipates Faulkner&#x2019;s rendering of the same theme. Stowe was charged with exaggerating the evils of slavery, but her stay in Cincinnati, Ohio, where her father (the formidable Lyman Beecher, head of the Lane Theological Seminary) gave her a close look at the miseries of the slave communities across the Ohio River. People in her circle of friends were continually harboring slaves who escaped across the river from Kentucky on the way, they hoped, to Canada.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two other novels, along with&nbsp;<i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i>, show the range and variety of her literary accomplishment.&nbsp;<i>The Minister&#x2019;s Wooing</i>&nbsp;(1859) is set in Newport, Rhode Island, after the Revolution. It is a romance based in part on the life of Stowe&#x2019;s sister, and it traces to a happy ending the conflicts in a young woman between adherence to Calvinistic rigor and her expression of preference in the choice of a marital partner. The third novel,&nbsp;<i>Oldtown Folks</i>&nbsp;(1869), confirms Stowe&#x2019;s genius for the realistic rendering of ordinary experience, her talent for social portraiture with a keen satiric edge, and her subtlety in exploring a wide group of themes, from child-rearing practices and religious controversy to romantic seduction and betrayal. But finally, it is the old town and a way of life that no longer exists that is the true subject of this elegiac novel.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

In 1832, the family moved to Cincinnati, where Harriet married Calvin Ellis Stowe, a professor at the seminary, in 1836. The border town of Cincinnati was alive with abolitionist conflict and there Mrs. Stowe took an active part in community life. She came into contact with fugitive slaves, and learned from friends and from personal visits what life was like for the Negro in the South. In 1850, the Fugitive Slave Law was passed, and that same year Harriet&#x2019;s sister-in-law urged the author to put her feelings about the evils of slavery into words. <b>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</b> was first published serially during 1851-52 in The National Era, and in book form in 1852. In one year more than 300,000 copies of the novel were sold. Mrs. Stowe continued to write, publishing eleven other novels and numerous articles before her death at the age of eighty-five in Hartford, Connecticut.<p></p></p><h2>King Edward VIII: A Biography</h2><p>Drawing on Edward VIII&#39;s diaries and love letters and on the private papers of Chamberlain, Churchill, and Baldwin, this biography reveals the man who gave up a throne for love</p><p>Philip Ziegler was born in 1929 and educated at Eton and Oxford. He was a diplomat before becoming an editorial director at the publishers William Collins. His many books include acclaimed biographies of William IV, Lady Diana Cooper, Lord Mountbatten and Harold Wilson, as well as the classic history of the Black Death. His authorised biography of Edward Heath won the Elizabeth Longford Prize in 2011.This is quite certainly the best and now the definitive biography of the beleaguered Duke of Windsor. Ziegler is sympathetic, but does not mince words in reporting misdeeds. None yet can entirely supplant Frances Donaldson's standard King Edward VIII ( LJ 3/15/75), but Ziegler has the advantage of access to much recent research, and pulls it all together in an account that is judicious, informed, and above all highly readable. There have been so many Windsor books that librarians will look for reasons not to purchase another. This is not the one to reject. However, don't discard your biographies of the Duchess--she is, surprisingly, a secondary figure in this masterful study of the King and ex-King who gave up a throne for the woman he loved.

It describes a basic gravity-flow septic system including the tank and the drainfield. It will tell you a bit about soil and the ability of microorganisms to purify water-borne pathogens. <p>You will learn what you can do daily (dishes, toilet, washing machine) to promote healthy functioning of a septic system. We will describe common-sense maintenance, periodic tank inspections, and tank pumping when necessary. </p><p>There is a chapter on what to do if things go wrong, and information on simple graywater systems and on composting toilets. </p><p>Alternatives to the typical gravity-fed septic system are described, including mounds, sand-filters, pressure-dosed drainfields, and wetlands. </p><p>And for the small town facing the likelihood of a town-wide septic system upgrade,we provide advice on basic organization, dealing with engineers, and selecting the best option for wastewater disposal.</p></p><p>What Its About <p>An Unheralded Wonder </p><p>The gravity-powered septic system is a wonder of technology past and present. Its operation is so quiet, natural, and energy-free that we tend to forget the vital function it serves. </p><p>Sewage is carried from the house to the tank via gravity no motors, no fossil-fuel energy consumption, no noise. Wastewater goes from the tank to the drainfield also via gravity where microorganisms in the soil digest and purify bacteria and viruses. When the soil is suitable and the system healthy, it is an example of efficient design and natural forces, returning clean water to the water table (or to plants or the air) all functioning silently under the surface of the earth </p><p>What Is This Book? </p><p>There are currently more than 25 million septic systems in the United States. Moreover, each year, some 400,000 new systems are built. Yet in spite of such widespread usage, the average homeowner seems to know little about the basic operation and appropriate maintenance of a septic system. </p><p>This book describes the conventional gravity-fed septic system, how it works, how it should be treated (what should and should not go down the drain), how it should be maintained, and what to do if things go wrong. There is also basic information on the recent evolution in composting toilet systems, designs for simple graywater systems, and some of the typical alternatives to the standard, gravity-fed septic system. </p><p>There is a chapter with advice to any community faced with town-wide septic upgrades, and last, an illustrated chapter on the history of waterborne waste disposal. </p><p>As you will see, this is not an engineering treatise. Nor do we cover any of the many non-conventional systems in use in various parts of the country by a variety of wastewater engineers and soil scientists. This is a basic manual for the average homeowner, based on conventional systems, providing practical advice on how to keep these systems up (or should we say down?) and running. </p><p>Who Is This Book For? </p><p>Primarily homeowners (or home dwellers), but also for builders, architects, plumbers, septic contractors, pumpers, and realtors, as well as health departments, wastewater districts, and small towns anyone who wants to understand these very important, but often misunderstood, working principles. </p><p>If you are buying a house with a septic system, it is very important that you understand septic basics, so that you know what you are getting. </p><p>Why the Need for This Book? </p><p>Homeowners will find this book useful in terms of: </p><p>Working systems: By understanding septic system principles, you will know how to treat your system intelligently and maximize its useful life. </p><p>Partially failing systems: By changing daily household practices, and perhaps making minor repairs, you may be able to nurse along an ailing system or even bring it back to life. </p><p>Failing systems: You will be given a discovery process to search for the problem in a given order. You will discover if the problem is relatively easy to fix (as with pipe blockage), or major (drainfield failure). You will understand what went wrong and be given a variety of options for repair. </p><p>Alternative systems: By this we mean alternatives to the gravity-powered system typically, mounds, pressure-dosed drainfields, sand filters, etc. often required by health officials these days. You will be given the basics of these designs so you will understand how they work and what purpose they serve. </p><p>Some Caveats </p><p>The local angle: Although the principles described here are more or less the same all over the world, there are local factors of soil and climate, as well as practical experience, that will differ from region to region. Once you understand the basics, we suggest you talk to local builders, septic tank pumpers, and homeowners. There is no substitute for local experience. The comprehensive angle: We do not cover everything on the subject. We do not describe all possible systems in all parts of the world. Our intent here is to give you the basics, so you can make informed judgments on maintenance, repairs, and upgrades. </p><p>The appropriate technology angle: Unfortunately, regulatory agencies have tended to require higher-tech, more expensive systems in recent years. In some cases, this approach is necessary, but many times its overkill. Granted that there will be situations where soil and/or climate require other options, yet the gravity-fed system remains the simplest and most ecological design; it is the stick shift of septic systems, and therefore, the heart of this book. </p><p>The varying opinions angle: Experts in the field all have different opinions. We have consulted a number of professionals and have attempted to strike a balance as to sensible and useful information for homeowners. </p><p>Ongoing Septic Info </p><p>We will update, supplement, and correct this book in future editions and on the web.

He is the author of 15 previous books, including the bestselling novel &#34;Snow in August&#34; and the bestselling memoir &#34;A Drinking Life.&#34; He writes a daily column for the &#34;New York Daily News&#34; and lives in New York City.From the first plaintive, languorous sounds of a wind instrument, the canvas opens wide on a cultural struggle--on the intertwined history of a nation and a city--and on a robust adventure tale enveloped in myth. Hamill's saga covers a writer-artist's life well lived over four centuries, from the great good Irish house of his infancy to the canyons and towers of his adulthood in present-day New York City. It's a sprawling epic of ven-geance, whose various strands and themes are carefully balanced in this abridgment. Giving a gentle Irish lilt to the dialogue and effortlessly assuming the vocal patterns of other languages and genders, Stevie Ray Dallimore entices the listener as the drama shifts from swashbuckling tale to urban chronicle and as reality and fantasy blend. Hamill's personal insights into his work and his life, intoned on the final disc, offer a meaningful coda to his story.

And as Billy Bob's grandfather once told him, you do well in life by keeping the roots in a clear stream and not letting anyone taint the water for you. But in Holland's dusty little hometown of Deaf Smith, in the hill country north of Austin, local kingpin Earl Deitrich has made a fortune running roughshod and tainting anyone who stands in his way. Billy Bob has problems with Deitrich and his shamelessly callous demeanor, but can't shake the legacy of his passion for Deitrich's "heartbreak-beautiful" wife, Peggy Jean.<br><br>When Holland takes on the defense of Wilbur Pickett--a man accused of stealing an heirloom and three hundred thousand dollars in bonds from Deitrich's office--he finds himself up against not only Earl's power and influence, but also a past Billy Bob can't will away.&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderfully realized novel, rich in Texas atmosphere and lore, and a dazzling portrait of the deadly consequences of self-delusion, <b>Heartwood</b> could only have been written by James Lee Burke, a writer in expert command of his craft.</p><p>Whether he's writing about the Louisiana Bayou Country (in his Dave Robicheaux books) or the Texas hill towns around Austin (in his series about former Texas ranger Billy Bob Holland), James Lee Burke has deep roots in the American soil that link him to some of the great adventure writers of the past such as Jack London and Mark Twain. Like them, Burke writes novels illustrating how failure shapes a man much more than success does. <p>Central to Burke's second Billy Bob novel (<i>Cimarron Rose</i> was his first) is Wilbur Pickett. Wilbur had a brief moment of glory as a rodeo cowboy before sliding into a downward cycle of luckless enterprises. He ends up laboring for a wealthy family, the Dietrichs, in the Texas town of Deaf Smith. The Dietrichs accuse Wilbur of stealing some bearer bonds, and Billy Bob--now a defense attorney--reluctantly take his case. He is hesitant (because he idolizes Peggy Jean Dietrich), and for good reason: Billy Bob discovers that her husband Earl may be involved in shady, even violent, business practices.</p><p> Other ghosts from the past also haunt Billy Bob: he accidentally killed his former partner on a drug raid in Mexico and still hears his voice. And then there's Holland's illegitimate son Lucas, who is growing up with problems of his own. The weight of all this back-story might overwhelm a lesser writer, but Burke manages to make it seem as natural as the soft wind that stirs the tumbleweed in the town of Deaf Smith. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p><b>Critical acclaim for James Lee Burke and the Billy Bob Holland Series:</b><br><br>"Burke is a master at setting mood, laying in atmosphere, all with quirky, raunchy dialogue that's a delight."<br>--Elmore Leonard<br><br>"Billy Bob Holland is as angst-ridden and morally shell-shocked as Dave Robicheaux ever was, but like Robicheaux, Holland's moral compass always points to true north...Don't miss out."<br>--<i>Rocky Mountain News</i><br><br>"Burke [is] one of the best writers of our time. His plots build tension to such a pitch that it tempts one to rush through his books. But his writing demands that his works be savored."<br>--<i>Denver Post</i><br><br>"Burke is known for the lush bayou cadences that give solid flesh to his longtime series hero, deputy sheriff Dave Robicheaux, and this prose style moves easily to the steamy precincts of southeast Texas."<br>--<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i></p><h2>Trigun Maximum, Vol. 2: Death Blue (Trigun Maximum Graphic Novels)</h2><p>In the first volume of Trigun Maximum, we caught up with Vash and watched him jump back into service for Peace and Love!

Tour.</p><p>"Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood." The quote is from Frank McCourt's memoir of growing up impoverished in Limerick, circa World War II. But the sentiment might just as easily have come from the fictional lips of Henry Smart, the hero of Roddy Doyle's remarkable novel of Dublin in the teens, <i>A Star Called Henry</i>. The son of a one-legged hit man, young Henry is the third child born but the first to live through infancy. He is also the second Henry--the first having died, and become a star in the mind of his mother. <blockquote> She held me but she looked up at her twinkling boy. Poor me beside her, pale and red-eyed, held together by rashes and sores. A stomach crying to be filled, bare feet aching like an old, old man's. Me, a shocking substitute for the little Henry who'd been too good for this world, the Henry God had wanted for himself. Poor me. </blockquote> Soon, his father has all but abandoned the growing family, and at 9 Henry is on his own, running wild in the streets, thieving to stay alive. Depressing as all this sounds, Doyle has invested his narrator with such an appetite for life, and rendered him so resolutely unsorry for himself, that it seems almost insulting to pity him. <p> By the time he is 14, Henry has become a soldier in the new Irish Republican Army and in one long and harrowing chapter, we view the events of the Easter Rising of 1916 from his position in the thick of it. It's not a pretty sight by any means, as the populace is divided in its support and various factions within the Republican Army threaten to splinter and annihilate one another before the British even get there. When the shooting starts, Henry aims not at the British but at the store windows across the street. "I shot and killed all that I had been denied, all the commerce and snobbery that had been mocking me and other hundreds of thousands behind glass and locks, all the injustice, unfairness and shoes--while the lads took chunks out of the military." Though the uprising is eventually crushed and the leaders executed, Henry escapes to live--and fight--another day. </p><p> In previous books such as The Barrytown Trilogy, <i>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha</i>, and <i>The Woman Who Walked into Doors</i>, Doyle has established himself as one of the premiere chroniclers of modern Irish life. With <i>A Star Called Henry</i>, he works his singular magic on the past. What's more, this is only volume one of the Last Roundup, so it looks like we haven't seen the last of Henry Smart. And that's a very good thing, indeed. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p>"Like all great comic writers, Roddy Doyle has become an explorer of the deepest places of the heart, of love and pain and loss." - Irish Times</p> <p>"Doyle's brilliant use of dialogue--ranks him as one of the best Irish writers of his time." -- London Free Press</p> <p>"Doyle [is] a master of voice and place."-- The Toronto Star</p> <p>"Doyle has a magnificent gift for taking the ordinary and giving it life." -- Calgary Herald</p> <p>"Doyle's stories of difficult, messy working-class life--have struck a chord with readers around the world.-- Wretched things happen, people make foolish mistakes again and again, but the stories close at the point where characters have achieved some level of dignity."-The Globe and Mail</p> <p>The Commitments:</p> <p>"An imaginative and hilarious comedy that makes sense of the absurd behaviour of a collection of youth trying to form a rock band." -- London Free Press</p> <p>The Snapper:</p> <p>"An uproarious dissertation on teenage</p> <p>pregnancy." -- The Edmonton Journal</p> <p>The Van:</p> <p>"A novel which is often hilarious, always enthralling and -- this is really the case -- unputdownable." -- Sunday Times</p> <p>Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha: </p> <p>1993 Booker Prize Winner </p> <p>"[Doyle's] triumph in this novel is to replenish our sense of how children think and speak and explain the adult world to themselves." -- London Review of Books</p> <p>The Woman Who Walked into Doors:</p> <p>"Paula Spencer, scars and all, ranks as one of his finest creations." -- The Toronto Star</p></p><h2>Twilight at Mac&#39;s Place</h2><p>Actor/detective Granville Haynes and his friends from the notorious bar Mac&#39;s Place move through a Washington labyrinth of deceit and murder when the memoirs of Granville&#39;s CIA father threaten to come to light</p><p>Ross Thomas is ranked as one of the very top thriller writers by his fellow authors, and his readers loudly agree. Two Edgar Awards, and other prizes, only complement the abundant praise that Thomas has received. <br><br>Thomas died in 1995, and since then all but one of his twenty-five novels had gone out of print. This should never have happened to the man of whom <i>The New Yorker</i> has said "Very few...are as consistently entertaining...even fewer can match him for style and power." Minotaur is proud to remedy this situation by reissuing Thomas's novels. So start reading, and prepare to join Ross Thomas's legions of admiring fans. <br>Thomas ( The Fourth Durango , etc.) is at his best here with an intricate, riveting plot and a fine dry humor. Steadfast Haynes, for many years an unofficial CIA "fixer," dies of a heart attack in Washington. His funeral brings together his 30-ish son Granville, Granny's childhood chum (and Steady's lover) Isabelle, CIA retiree Gilbert Undean and minor arms dealer Tinker Burns. Steady has written his memoirs and left the rights to Granny. In quick succession: Granny discovers Steady's "book" is mainly blank pages; Isabelle is murdered; an unknown woman steals the manuscript at gunpoint; and Undean is shot to death. Granny, ex-L.A. homicide dick, aspiring actor and inheritor of Steady's fabled charm and good looks, begins his own investigation, helped by Erika, daughter of a D.C. restaurateur. The complicated plot--two shadowy bidders vie for rights to a real manuscript, Granny and Erika fall in love, there's another murder, with a couple of twists at the end--is helped enormously by a wonderful cast of characters, including a stiff German headwaiter who quotes Proust aptly and effortlessly. A sophisticated, winning performance. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Reef Creature Identification: Florida Caribbean Bahamas</h2><p>The book that has been relied on for a decade to identify the weird and wonderful crabs, lobsters, shrimps, jellies, sponges, tunicates and mollusks that inhabit the reefs is now 30 percent larger!

Since its publication in France in 1942, Camus&#x2019;s novel has been translated into sixty languages and sold more than six million copies. It&#x2019;s the rare novel that&#x2019;s as at likely to be found in a teen&#x2019;s backpack as in a graduate philosophy seminar. If the twentieth century produced a novel that could be called ubiquitous, <i>The Stranger</i> is it.<br> &nbsp;<br> How did a young man in his twenties who had never written a novel turn out a masterpiece that still grips readers more than seventy years later? With <i>Looking for &#x201c;The Stranger&#x201d;</i>, Alice Kaplan tells that story. In the process, she reveals Camus&#x2019;s achievement to have been even more impressive&#x2014;and more unlikely&#x2014;than even his most devoted readers knew.<br> &nbsp;<br> Born in poverty in colonial Algeria, Camus started out as a journalist covering the criminal courts. The murder trials he attended, Kaplan shows, would be a major influence on the development and themes of <i>The Stranger</i>. She follows Camus to France, and, making deft use of his diaries and letters, re-creates his lonely struggle with the novel in Montmartre, where he finally hit upon the unforgettable first-person voice that enabled him to break through and complete <i>The Stranger</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even then, the book&#x2019;s publication was far from certain. France was straining under German occupation, Camus&#x2019;s closest mentor was unsure of the book&#x2019;s merit, and Camus himself was suffering from near-fatal tuberculosis. Yet the book did appear, thanks in part to a resourceful publisher, Gaston Gallimard, who was undeterred by paper shortages and Nazi censorship. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The initial critical reception of <i>The Stranger </i>was mixed, and it wasn&#x2019;t until after liberation that <i>The Stranger</i> began its meteoric rise. As France and the rest of the world began to move out of the shadow of war, Kaplan shows, Camus&#x2019;s book&#x2014; with the help of an aggressive marketing campaign by Knopf for their 1946 publication of the first English translation&#x2014;became a critical and commercial success, and Camus found himself one of the most famous writers in the world. Suddenly, his seemingly modest tale of alienation was being seen for what it really was: a powerful parable of the absurd, an existentialist masterpiece.<br> &nbsp;<br> Few books inspire devotion and excitement the way <i>The Stranger</i> does. And it couldn&#x2019;t have a better biographer than Alice Kaplan, whose books about twentieth-century French culture and history have won her legions of fans. No reader of Camus will want to miss this brilliant exploration.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Alice Kaplan</b> is the author of numerous books, including <i>Dreaming in French</i>, <i>The Interpreter, French Lessons</i>, and <i>The Collaborator</i>, the last of which was a finalist for the National Book Award.<br> &nbsp;"To this new project, Kaplan brings equally honed skills as a historian, literary critic, and biographer. . . . In an epilogue, Ms. Kaplan goes a step further and looks for the identity of the Arab involved in the real-life altercation that inspired the novel's pivotal scene. What she learns about him is fascinating, and how she writes about parallels between him and Camus is a lovely example of her own imaginative powers and stylish prose. . . . Reading <i>The Stranger</i> is a bracing but somewhat bloodless experience. Ms. Kaplan has hung warm flesh on its steely bones." (John Williams <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"Fascinating. . . . Engrossing." (<i>Library Journal, starred review</i>)<br><br>"A first-rate acount, rich in intriguing details." (<i>Weekly Standard</i>)<br><br>"An absorbing account of the making of <i>The Stranger</i>. For American readers, few French novels are better known, and few scholars are better qualified than Kaplan to reintroduce us to it. The author of several fine biographies of French and American writers, as well as the ravishing memoir <i>French Lessons</i>, Kaplan here sets herself the task of writing a biography of a book. . . . Kaplan tells this story with great verve and insight, all the while preserving the mystery of its creation and elusiveness of its meaning. . . . While some might question Kaplan&#x2019;s claim that the novel 'changed the course of modern literature' few will ever question either the work's perennial appeal or the brilliance with which Kaplan has told its story." (Robert Zaretsky <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>)<br><br>"Kaplan's research is exhaustive (she includes an extensive bibliography), her tone is conversational, and her analyses convincing and often surprising. . . . Kaplan is a superb storyteller. One of the best chapters of the book, 'Gallimard's War', reads like a philosophical thriller with its Nazi censors, misunderstandings, and moral conundrums. Yet, through all this she never loses focus on the novel to which her book is dedicated. . . .&nbsp; Equally engaging are her chapters documenting the initial reception of the book in both the French- and English-speaking world. . . . Surely destined to become the quintessential companion to Camus's most enduring novel." (<i>PopMatters</i>)<br><br>"The fascinating story behind Albert Camus' coldblooded masterpiece. . . . A swiftly told, deeply researched literary investigation. . . . While she doesn't offer any final interpretation, her detective work deepens the understanding of a work whose power resides as much in what it doesn't say as what it does. A compelling companion to a novel that has stayed strange." (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"Splendid." (<i>Jane Ciabattari, BBC Culture</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Kaplan&#x2019;s history charts the success of Camus&#x2019;s debut novel, which is an astonishing tale. It was published in the most unpropitious circumstances, during the Nazi Occupation. Kaplan is particularly brilliant at showing the ways in which the novel was refracted in reading. <i>L&#x2019;�tranger</i> has been called a &#x2018;colonial allegory, an existential prayer book, an indictment of conventional morality, a study in alienation, or a Hemingway rewrite of Kafka&#x2019;"<br> &nbsp; (<i>Spectator</i>)<br><br>"Stellar. . . . A fascinating mix of straight fact--she names the bells that inspired the one that rings in the novel's verdict scene--and astute psychological inference.&nbsp;. . . &nbsp;Though it's left unsaid,&nbsp;<i>Looking for The Stranger</i> is also a wistful reminder of the vital role novels and criticism played in our culture not so very long ago (<i>The Stranger</i>&nbsp;went on to sell millions after Sartre endorsed it in a review)--a role that's sadly almost unimaginable today."

As the search closes in, the killer becomes increasingly desperate, and Harry&#x2019;s chase takes him to the most forbidden corners of the former Yugoslavia. <br><br> Yet it&#x2019;s when he returns to Oslo that he encounters true darkness: among the homeless junkies and Salvationists, eagerly awaiting a savior to deliver them from misery&#x2014;whether he brings new life or immediate death. <br><br> With its shrewdly vertiginous narrative, acid-etched characters, and white-hot pace,<i> The Redeemer</i> is resounding proof of Jo Nesb�&#x2019;s standing as one of the best crime writers of our time.</p></p><p>Jo Nesb�&#x2019;s books, translated into forty-seven languages, have sold more than seventeen million copies worldwide. His other Harry Hole novels include <i>The Redbreast, Nemesis, The Devil&#x2019;s Star, The Snowman </i>(soon to be made into a major motion picture),<i> The Leopard,</i> and <i>Phantom, </i>and he is the author of <i>Headhunters </i>and several children&#x2019;s books. Among the many international awards he has received is the Glass Key Award for best Nordic crime novel, and he has been recognized by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and the Norwegian book clubs with an award for the best Norwegian crime novel of all time. In addition, Nesb� has been short-listed for an Edgar Award and three times for the CWA International Dagger. He is also a musician, songwriter, and economist and lives in Oslo.part one<br>Advent<br><br> 1<br> august 1991<br> &nbsp;<br> The Stars<br> &nbsp;<br> She was fourteen years old and sure that if she shut her eyes tight and concentrated she could see the stars through the roof.<br> &nbsp;<br> All around her, women were breathing. Regular, heavy, nighttime breathing. One was snoring, and that was Auntie Sara, who had been given a mattress beneath the open window.<br> &nbsp;<br> She closed her eyes and tried to breathe like the others. It was difficult to sleep, especially because everything around her was so new and different. The sounds of the night and the forest beyond the window in �stg�rd were different. The people she knew from the meetings in the citadel and the summer camps were somehow not the same. She was not the same, either. The face and body she saw in the mirror this summer were new. And her emotions, these strange hot and cold currents that flowed through her when the boys looked at her. Or when one of them in particular looked at her. Robert. He was different this year, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> She opened her eyes again and stared. She knew God had the power to do great things, even allow her to see the stars through the roof. If it was His wish.<br> &nbsp;<br> It had been a long and eventful day. The dry summer wind had whispered through the corn, and the leaves on the trees danced as if in a fever, causing the light to filter through to the visitors on the field. They had been listening to one of the Salvation Army cadets from the -officer--training school talking about his work as a preacher on the Faeroe Islands. He was -good--looking and spoke with great sensitivity and passion. But she was preoccupied with shooing away a bumblebee that kept buzzing around her head, and by the time it moved off, the heat had made her drowsy. When the cadet finished, all faces were turned to the territorial commander, David Eckhoff, who had been observing them with his smiling, young eyes, which were actually over fifty years old. He saluted in the Salvation Army manner, with his right hand raised above his shoulder and pointing to the kingdom of heaven, amid a resounding shout of &#x201c;Hallelujah!&#x201d; Then he prayed for the cadets&#x2019; work with the poor and the pariahs to be blessed, and reminded them of the Gospel of Matthew, where it said that Jesus the Redeemer was among them, a stranger on the street, maybe a criminal, without food and without clothing. And that on Judgment Day the righteous, those who had helped the weakest, would have eternal life. It had all the makings of a long speech, but then someone whispered something and he said, with a smile, that Youth Hour was next on the program and today it was Rikard Nilsen&#x2019;s turn.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had heard Rikard make his voice deeper than it was to thank the commander. As usual, he had prepared what he was going to say in writing and memorized it. He stood up and recited how he was going to devote his life to the fight, to Jesus&#x2019;s fight for the kingdom of God. His voice was nervous, yet monotonous and soporific. His introverted glower rested on her. Her eyes were heavy. His sweaty top lip was moving to form the familiar, secure, tedious phrases. So she -didn&#x2019;t react when the hand touched her back. Not until it became fingertips and they wandered down to the small of her back, and lower, and made her freeze beneath her thin summer dress.<br> &nbsp;<br> She turned and looked into Robert&#x2019;s smiling brown eyes. And she wished her skin were as dark as his so that he would not be able to see her blush.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Shh,&#x201d; Jon had said.<br> &nbsp;<br> Robert and Jon were brothers. Although Jon was one year older, many people had taken them for twins when they were younger. But Robert was seventeen now and while they had retained some facial similarities, the differences were clearer. Robert was happy and carefree, liked to tease and was good at playing the guitar, but was not always punctual for services in the citadel, and sometimes the teasing had a tendency to go too far, especially if he noticed others were laughing. Then Jon would often step in. Jon was an honest, conscientious boy who most thought would go to -officer--training school and -would&#x2014;-though this was never formulated out -loud&#x2014;-find himself a girl in the Army. The latter could not be taken for granted in Robert&#x2019;s case. Jon was three-quarters of an inch taller than Robert, but in some strange way Robert seemed taller. From the age of twelve Jon had begun to stoop, as though he were carrying the woes of the world on his back. Both were -dark--skinned, -good--looking, with regular features, but Robert had something Jon did not have. There was something in his eyes, something black and playful, which she wanted and yet did not want to investigate further.<br> &nbsp;<br> While Rikard was talking, her eyes were wandering across the sea of assembled familiar faces. One day she would marry a boy from the Salvation Army and perhaps they would both be posted to another town or another part of the country. But they would always return to �stg�rd, which the Army had just bought and was to be their summer site from now on.<br> &nbsp;<br> On the margins of the crowd, sitting on the steps leading to the house, was a boy with blond hair stroking a cat that had settled in his lap. She could tell that he had been watching her, but he had looked away just as she noticed. He was the one person here she -didn&#x2019;t know, but she did know that his name was Mads Gilstrup, that he was the grandchild of the people who had owned �stg�rd before, that he was a couple of years older than her and that the Gilstrup family was wealthy. He was attractive, in fact, but there was something solitary about him. And what was he doing here, anyway? He had been there the previous night, walking around with an angry frown on his face, not talking to anyone. She had felt his eyes on her a few times. Everyone looked at her this year. That was new, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was jerked out of these thoughts by Robert taking her hand, putting something in it and saying: &#x201c;Come to the barn when the -general--in--waiting has finished. I&#x2019;ve got something to show you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he stood up and walked off, and she looked down into her hand and almost screamed. With one hand over her mouth, she dropped the object into the grass. It was a bumblebee. It could still move, despite not having legs or wings.<br> &nbsp;<br> At last Rikard finished, and she sat watching her parents and Robert and Jon&#x2019;s parents moving -toward the tables where the coffee was. They were both what Army people in their respective Oslo congregations called &#x201c;strong families,&#x201d; and she knew watchful eyes were on her.<br> &nbsp;<br> She walked -toward the outhouse. Once she was around the corner, where no one could see her, she scurried in the direction of the barn.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you know what this is?&#x201d; said Robert with the smile in his eyes and the deep voice he had not had the summer before.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was lying on his back in the hay whittling a tree root with the penknife he always carried in his belt.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he held it up and she saw what it was. She had seen drawings. She hoped it was too dark for him to see her blush again.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she lied, sitting beside him in the hay.<br> &nbsp;<br> And he gave her that teasing look of his, as if he knew something about her she -didn&#x2019;t even know herself. She returned his gaze and fell back on her elbows.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is where it goes,&#x201d; he said, and in an instant his hand was up her dress. She could feel the hard tree root against the inside of her thigh and, before she could close her legs, it was touching her underpants. His breath was hot on her neck.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, Robert,&#x201d; she whispered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I made it for you,&#x201d; he wheezed in return.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Stop. I don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you saying no? To me?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She caught her breath and was unable either to answer or to scream because at that moment they heard Jon&#x2019;s voice from the barn door: &#x201c;Robert! No, Robert!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She felt him relax and let go, and the tree root was left between her clenched thighs as he withdrew his hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come here!&#x201d; Jon said, as though talking to a disobedient dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a chuckle Robert got up, winked at her and ran out into the sun to his brother.<br> &nbsp;<br> She sat up and brushed the hay off her, feeling both relieved and ashamed at the same time. Relieved because Jon had spoiled their crazy game. Ashamed because he seemed to think it was more than that: a game.<br> &nbsp;<br> Later, during grace before their evening meal, she had looked up straight into Robert&#x2019;s brown eyes and seen his lips form one word. She -didn&#x2019;t know what it was, but she had started to giggle. He was crazy! And she was . . . well, what was she? Crazy, too. Crazy. And in love? Yes, in love, precisely that. And not in the way she had been when she was twelve or thirteen. Now she was fourteen and this was bigger. More important. And more exciting.<br> &nbsp;<br> She could feel the laughter bubbling up inside her now, as she lay there trying to stare through the roof.<br> &nbsp;<br> Auntie Sara grunted and stopped snoring beneath the window. Something screeched. An owl?<br> &nbsp;<br> She needed to pee.<br> &nbsp;<br> She didn&#x2019;t feel like going out, but she had to. Had to walk through the dewy grass past the barn, which was dark and quite a different proposition in the middle of the night. She closed her eyes, but it didn&#x2019;t help. She crept out of her sleeping bag, slipped on some sandals and tiptoed over to the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few stars had appeared in the sky, but they would disappear when day broke in the east in an -hour&#x2019;s time. The cool air caressed her skin as she scampered along, listening to the unidentifiable sounds of the night. Insects that stayed quiet during the day. Animals hunting. Rikard said he had seen foxes in the distant copse. Or perhaps the animals were the same ones that were out during the day, but just made different sounds. They changed. Shed their skins, so to speak.<br> &nbsp;<br> The outhouse stood alone on a small mound behind the barn. She watched it grow in size as she came closer. The strange, crooked hut had been made with untreated wooden boards that had warped, split and turned gray. No windows, a heart on the door. The worst thing about it was that you never knew if anyone was already in there.<br> &nbsp;<br> And she had an instinct that someone was already in there.<br> &nbsp;<br> She coughed so that whoever was there might signal his presence. A magpie took off from a branch on the edge of the wood. Otherwise all was still.<br> &nbsp;<br> She stepped up onto the flagstone. Grabbed the lump of wood that passed for a door handle. Pulled it. The black room gaped open.<br> &nbsp;<br> She breathed out. There was a flashlight beside the toilet seat, but she -didn&#x2019;t need to switch it on. She raised the seat lid before closing the door and fastening the door hook. Then she pulled up her nightgown, pulled down her underwear and sat down. In the ensuing silence she thought she heard something. Something that was neither animal nor magpie nor insects shedding skin. Something that moved fast through the tall grass behind the toilet. Then the trickle started and the noise was obscured. But her heart had already started pounding.<br> &nbsp;<br> When she had finished, she quickly pulled up her underpants and sat in the dark listening. But all she could hear was a faint ripple in the tops of the trees and her blood throbbing in her ears. She waited for her pulse to slow down, then she unhooked the catch and opened the door. The dark figure filled almost the entire doorway. He must have been standing and waiting silently outside on the stone step. The next minute she was splayed over the toilet seat and he stood above her. He closed the door behind him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You?&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me,&#x201d; he said in an alien, tremulous, husky voice.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then he was on top of her. His eyes glittered in the dark as he bit her lower lip until he drew blood and one hand found the way under her nightgown and tore off her underwear. She lay there crippled with fear beneath the knife blade that stung the skin on her neck while he kept thrusting his groin into her before he had even got his trousers off, like some crazed, copulating dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One word from you and I&#x2019;ll cut you into pieces,&#x201d; he whispered. And not one word issued from her mouth. Because she was fourteen years old and sure that if she shut her eyes tightly and concentrated she would be able to see the stars through the roof. God had the power to do things like that. If it was His wish.</p><h2>How to Grow Vegetables and Fruits by the Organic Method</h2><p>Rodale, J.I., How To Grow Vegetables And Fruits By The Organic Method</p><p>Another impressive tome from Rodale Press, this practical text of nearly 1,000 pages covers organic gardening from the first soil preparation to the final harvesting and preserving. <i>How to Grow Vegetable and Fruits by the Organic Method</i> may be a bit daunting for the novice gardener, simply because of the size, but rest assured that all information is presented with a clear and simple vocabulary that first-timers can relate to easily. There's lots of handy lists and tables outlining the chemical composition of common items (feathers, fur, leaves) as well as charts for planting seasons and depths. <p> Unusual in a book of this size, there's also lots of letters from amateur gardeners addressing topics that range from a favorite type of lettuce (oakleaf) to in-house mushroom cultivation (under the sink is excellent). Illustrations tend to be line drawings, as well as small black-and-white photos--while helpful, they're just not as eye-pleasing as the big, color photos found in other books. For the committed organic gardener, the completeness of the text should more than make up for the lack of prettiness, as this book outlines numerous successful methods in use for decades. A great textbook for a crash course in organics or a handy reference manual for unfamiliar challenges, this is sure to provide fresh ideas for even the most experienced green thumbs out there. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>J.I.

Set in the corrupt and spectral Mexico City of the forties, <b>Queer</b> is the story of William Lee, a man afflicted with both acute heroin withdrawal and romantic and sexual yearnings for an indifferent user named Eugene Allerton. The narrative is punctuated by Lee's outrageous "routines" &#x2014; brilliant comic monologues that foreshadow <b>Naked Lunch</b> &#x2014;yet the atmosphere is heavy with foreboding.<p>In his extraordinary introduction, Burroughs reflects on the shattering events in his life that lay behind this work.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p>William S. Burroughs (1914-1997)&#x2014;guru of the Beat Generation, controversial&nbsp;�minence grise of the international avant-garde, dark prophet, and blackest of black humor satirists&#x2014;had a range of influence rivaled by few post-World War II writers. His many books include <b>Naked Lunch</b>, <b>Queer</b>, <b>Exterminator!</b>, <b>The Cat Inside</b>, <b>The Western Lands</b>, and <b>Interzone</b>.In an introduction, Burroughs observes that he wrote this heretofore unpublished picaresque novel in 1951, well before Naked Lunch established his reputation. He reveals that the book had its genesis in a terrible event: his accidental shooting to death of his wife, Joan, a tragedy that released the black wellsprings of his talent. The narrative recounts the hallucinatory life of William Lee, an American in Mexico City in the 1940s and his journey to Ecuador with his reluctant lover, Eugene Allerton, in search of the drug Yage. Lee is Burroughs after the killing, weighed down by guilt, drugs, lust and despair; seeking lethe. Admirerers will find an early exposition of Burroughs's later themes here, as well as a strain of gallows humor. The work is almost cinematic as it unfolds; the author is not yet experimenting with the meaninglessness of language, and, indeed it is thin in both thought and expression. This is the first of a series of Burroughs's works to be issued by Viking. Foreign rights: Andrew Wylie Agency.

This is especially true if you grew up in the 1980s, because <em>The Impossible Fortress</em> is a coming-of-age story tucked inside a love letter to that strange and wonderful decade. The novel is set in 1987 when computer games had only recently entered our homes, <em>Jolt</em> cola (the predecessor of modern energy drinks) was still a thing, and <em>Playboy</em> magazine had countless 14-year-old boys across the country trying to get their hands on a copy of the Vanna White (of <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> fame) issue.

Author Jason Rekulak&#x2019;s ability to conjure powerful adolescent feelings of friendship, first love, and that difficult place where the two collide, is impressive. Laughter comes from page after page, and some clever surprises too&#x2014;all of it with a 1980s mixed tape running in the background. <em>--Seira Wilson, The Amazon Book Review</em></p>Jason Rekulak was born and raised in New Jersey.

The humility of this title--the "now and then" that refers to the occasional glimpse of glory but does not claim any more for itself than that--beautifully reveals something of the tone and attitude of Buechner himself. It also suggests what it is about him that readers hold so dear. In this volume, picking up where the first book left off, Buechner begins with his education at Union Theological Seminary, where he studied under Tillich and others. He then tells of his years as minister and teacher at Phillips Exeter Academy, concluding with his move to Vermont and his decision to make a living as a full-time writer.<p> As he says very simply in the introduction, "if you tell your own story with sufficient candor and concreteness, it will be an interesting story and in some sense a universal story." It will also, as this book affirms, be a story that says something of the myriad ways in which God speaks to us. This realization lies at the center of this small but lovely book. "Autobiography becomes a way of praying," he concludes, "and a book like this, if it matters at all, matters mostly as a call to prayer." <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p><p>Frederick Buechner, author of more than thirty works of fiction and nonfiction, is an ordained Presbyterian minister. He has been a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and was honored by the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Hemingway&#39;s well-known fascination with big game hunting is magnificently captured in this evocative account-an examination of the lure of the hunt and an impassioned portrait of the glory of the African landscape and of the beauty of a wilderness that was, even then, being threatened by the incursions of man. Writing in a terse, stripped-down style, first as a reporter and then a novelist, Hemingway was an enormously influential author from the 1920s through the 50s, and won both the Pulitzer and Nobel Prizes.

Definitions and descriptions of practical applications of oceanography are imaginatively presented on sepia-toned pages. The entries are brief but packed with information. One page displays the semaphore alphabet and includes a message for readers to translate. The answer is revealed in the &#x201c;Solutions&#x201d; section, which also contains the answers to the other challenges scattered throughout the text. Every page has illustrations; some, such as the maps of the currents and of the Earth's plates, are in color. The chapter entitled &#x201c;A Shifting Surface&#x201d; contains a cleverly inserted &#x201c;Publisher Note&#x201d; that attests to the prescience of the writer when facts not known in 1863, such as the theory of plate tectonics, are presented. The detachable sheet of colored stickers and letter in an envelope on the marbled endpapers could be removed before the book is ready for circulation. Informative and engaging, this attractive title will appeal to browsers and be useful for reports.&#x2013;Frances E. Millhouser, formerly at Chantilly Regional Library, Fairfax County, VA.

They braved the elements in search of the skins of beavers and other wild animals, to sell or barter for goods. The lifestyle of the mountain men could be harsh, existing as they did among animals, and spending most of their days and nights living and camping out in the great unexplored wilds of the Rockies. Life outdoors presented many threats, not least among them Native Americans, who were hostile to the mountain men encroaching on the area for their own purposes. For a certain kind of pioneer, this risk and more were outweighed by the benefits of living free, without the restrictions and boundaries of &#x201c;civilized&#x201d; settlements.<br><br>In <i>The Adventures of the Mountain Men</i>, editor Stephen Brennan has compiled many of the best stories about the mountain men&#x2014;the most daring exploits, the death-defying chances taken to hunt big game, the clashes with the arrows of Native Americans, and also the moments when the men were struck by the incomparable beauty of the unsullied, majestic Rocky Mountains.</p><p>Stephen Brennan is the coauthor of The Adventurous Boy&#39;s Handbook and The Adventurous Girl&#39;s Handbook, and editor of The Best Pirate Stories Ever Told and The Best Sailing Stories Ever Told.

It came so coldly and so fast that the waves of the ocean froze as they rolled. The good ship Lucky Star froze with them, trapped tight in the suddenly solid sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shen, the cabin boy, the youngest member of the crew, stirred in his sleep as the sounds of rippling and splashing faded into frozen silence. He snuggled deeper under the covers, trying to keep warm. Into the silence came other noises. First, the creaking of timber as the ice tightened its grip upon the old ship&#x2019;s sides. Then the voice of Captain Jeggings, bellowing, &#x201c;All hands on deck!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The crew bumbled blinking from their bunks. Able Seaman Bo; Mungbean, the ship&#x2019;s cook; and Shen. They stumbled out on deck and stared at the frozen waves, which reared up all around them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t just stand there!&#x201d; shouted Captain Jeggings, hauling an icy rope. &#x201c;Get us out of here!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The rope snapped in his hands with a sound like breaking glass. The <i>Lucky Star</i> groaned and quivered as the ice clenched tighter.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What will we do?&#x201d; asked Shen.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Captain Jeggings didn&#x2019;t know. Neither did Able Seaman Bo. Neither did Mungbean. They&#x2019;d weathered storms and sat out still waters, but they&#x2019;d never seen a sea like this before.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Creak</i>. <i>Crunch</i>. Big tusks of ice pushed the planks apart and pierced the Lucky Star&#x2019;s sides. Slosh. Gurgle. Cold black water that hadn&#x2019;t frozen yet came swirling in. The ship sagged, and all the icicles that decked her rig- ging tinkled cheerfully. But Captain Jeggings couldn&#x2019;t see anything to be cheerful about.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The cargo!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;We must save the cargo!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> All summer long, the <i>Lucky Star</i> had been cruising from port to port, selling this and buying that. Two thousand chunky-knit sweaters from the Isles of Aran, a second- hand snowmobile . . . and sixty-six pugs. Captain Jeggings had said those tiny dogs would sell like hot pies. Now, down in the leaking hold, they let out a terrible howling as cold sea sloshed round their paws.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The dogs!&#x201d; shouted Shen. &#x201c;We must save the dogs!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mungbean and Bo went running down the steep stairway that led to the cargo holds and came struggling back up with crates of sweaters. Captain Jeggings hauled the snowmobile over the ship&#x2019;s side. Meanwhile, Shen turned over the boxes where more pugs were sleeping. The tiny dogs raced up on deck and jumped off the <i>Lucky</i> <i>Star</i> &#x2019;s sides onto the ice. Shen had heard people talk about rats leaving a sinking ship before, but he&#x2019;d never heard of pugs leaving a freezing one. There&#x2019;s a first time for everything, he thought. He dragged the sack that held their leashes and harnesses up onto the deck and threw it after them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The <i>Lucky</i> <i>Star</i> shuddered again, squeezed in the teeth of the ice. Planks popped out of the deck. The mast trembled like a chopped tree. Captain Jeggings shouted as he jumped over the side.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Shen had thought of something else that needed to be saved. &#x201c;The dog food! It&#x2019;s still on board!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll have to stay there, then!&#x201d; yelled Bo, jumping down onto the ice with Mungbean. Shen passed the smallest of the pugs down to them, then jumped after them.<br> &nbsp;<br> With a final heave, the ice crushed the old ship flat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Shen and the pugs stood and shivered, while Captain Jeggings and the others got the snowmobile ready. Its engine coughed and snarled as they started it up. Into its trailer they piled the crates of cargo&#x2014;but there was no room for the dogs.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t leave them behind!&#x201d; wailed Shen.<br> &#x201c;Well, we can&#x2019;t stay here with them,&#x201d; said Captain Jeggings. &#x201c;This ice might melt as quickly as it came, and then where would we be? Way out at sea without a ship under us.<br> &nbsp;<br> Awkward!&#x201d; (He had told Shen that the sixty- six pugs would sell like hot pies, but he meant that they would sell in hot pies&#x2014;his aunt ran a pie shop at home, and she was always looking for new ingredients. They were by far the least valuable bit of his cargo, so he had decided to leave them behind.)<br> &#x201c;Maybe they&#x2019;ll follow us!&#x201d; said Shen. He climbed aboard the snowmobile with Bo and Mungbean and the captain. &#x201c;Come on, doggies!&#x201d; he called to the pugs.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dogs looked up at him, heads to one side. Their hot breath steamed and smoldered in the cold air like the breath of sixty-six tiny dragons.<br> &nbsp;<br> The snowmobile set off with a roar. The tower of crates in its trailer teetered and swayed as the snowmobile weaved its way be- tween the frozen waves.<br> The pugs sat where they were and watched it go.<br> &#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; shouted Shen. But they didn&#x2019;t seem to understand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wait for me, Captain!&#x201d; he yelled, and jumped down off the snowmobile. The frozen waves were slipperier than hills of glass. He slithered over them, back to where the pugs sat, and when they saw Shen coming, their tails began to wag and they ran to meet him. &#x201c;Come on, doggies!&#x201d; he said, patting sixty-six small round heads and getting licked by sixty-six small rough tongues. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to follow Captain Jeggings. . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But when he turned to look for the snowmobile, it was nowhere to be seen. Either Captain Jeggings hadn&#x2019;t heard when Shen shouted for him to wait . . . or he had decided that Shen and sixty-six pugs weren&#x2019;t worth waiting for.</p><h2>The Tale of Hill Top Farm: The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter</h2><p>After purchasing a farm in the beautiful Lake District of England, the animal lover attempts to make friends among her fellow villagers, while her animal companions find themselves caught up in solving a baffling mystery, in the first volume in a new mystery series inspired by the life of Beatrix Potter.</p><p><b>Susan Wittig Albert</b> grew up on a farm in Illinois and earned her Ph.D. at the University of California at Berkeley. A former professor of English and a university administrator and vice president, she is the author of the China Bayles Mysteries, the Darling Dahlias Mysteries, and the Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter. Some of her recent titles include<i> Widow&#x2019;s Tears</i>,<i> Cat&#x2019;s Claw</i>,<i> </i><i>The Darling Dahlias and the Confederate Rose</i>, and <i>The Tale of Castle Cottage</i>. She and her husband, Bill, coauthor a series of Victorian-Edwardian mysteries under the name Robin Paige, which includes such titles as <i>Death at Glamis Castle </i>and <i>Death at Whitechapel</i>.Adult/High School&#x2013;This novel is the first of a proposed eight-volume mystery series and, as might be expected, a great deal of time is spent introducing the characters who live in Near Sawrey, England, where Beatrix Potter has recently bought the farm of the title. This rather curious story, in which all the animals interact and speak to one another, opens with a death, strictly in the "cozy" category; however, the first eyewitness testimony comes some 60 pages later, and from a cat at that. The book comes "fully loaded" with an author's note, a cast of characters (actual beings distinguished from fictional), historical notes, a map, resources, recipes, and a glossary. Keeping track of all of the villagers plus all of the "talking" animals (never mind trying to keep track of clues&#x2013;this is a mystery after all) can become a chore. All that said, <i>Tale</i> is endearing and worth the work for most readers. The English country village resonates with charm and humor, and sleuth Beatrix positively shines. When the animals or children appear, the story gains an even more vivid voice. Teen fans of Potter or any book in which animals are the protagonists will find this mystery appealing.<i>&#x2013;Jane Halsall, McHenry Public Library District, IL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After losing their parents and having been abandoned by their uncle, they are now living in comfort and safety with her friend Samantha&#39;s family in New York City. Best of all, Samantha&#39;s Uncle Gard and Aunt Cornelia want to adopt all three of the O&#39;Malley girls. This will make Nellie and Samantha sisters as well as best friends, and it will allow Nellie to keep a promise she made to her dying mother--to protect her little sisters. But when Nellie&#39;s no-good uncle, Mike O&#39;Malley, turns up again, he threatens to take Nellie and her sisters back and ruin everything. Nellie is determined not to let that happen, but soon discovers that even her friendship with Samantha has been affected by Uncle Mike&#39;s threat. How can all the good things in her new life unravel so fast? Is there a way to keep her promise and save everything she loves the most?</p><p>Grade 3-5&#x2013;Nellie O'Malley lost both of her parents to influenza and she is charged with caring for her younger sisters, Bridget and Jenny. Forced to live with their vile Uncle Mike, who took their money and abandoned them, the girls ended up in an orphanage, where Nellie's friend Samantha found them and took them to live with her at her Uncle Gard and Aunt Cornelia's house. In this companion to the "Samantha" books (Pleasant Company), the sisters are not only taken care of, but also surrounded by a loving family. When Uncle Mike reappears and threatens to take them away, Nellie fears that she may lose her happy new home. The plot has just the right amount of action and suspense to keep the story moving. Nellie struggles mightily to solve her problems on her own, and is a strongly developed protagonist. Samantha is also a fully realized character, and the girls' interaction is realistic. The ending comes to a fitting conclusion that will leave readers satisfied. An enlightening historical endnote describes "Adoption in 1906" and the plight of orphans. Interspersed throughout the text are charming and vibrant, full-page color paintings as well as tiny scenes of people and places. Another winning entry and a natural progression from the "Samantha" series (Pleasant Company).<i>&#x2013;Kristen Oravec, Cuyahoga County Public Library, Strongsville, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Edited by his son and translator.</p><p>These stories, written between the early 1920s to the mid-1950s, reveal the fascinating progress of Nabokov&#39;s early development as they remind us that we are in the presence of a magnificent original, a genuine master. Edited by his son and translator, Dmitri Nabokov, this volume is a literary event.From Vladimir Nabokov, the writer who shocked and delighted the world with his novels Lolita, Pale Fire, and Ada, or Ardor, comes a magnificent collection of stories. Written between the 1920s and the 1950s, these sixty-eight tales - fourteen of which have been translated into English for the first time - display all the shades of Nabokov&#39;s imagination. They range from sprightly fables to bittersweet tales of loss, from claustrophobic exercises in horror to a connoisseur&#39;s samplings of the table of human folly.

When he learns that a boy is walking through the garden toward Martha and the chicks, Petook frantically runs to protect his family. He need not have worried; the boy is kind and entranced by the chicks. Many years later, Petook spends a restless night and wakes at dawn to see three crosses high on the distant hill of Calvary. He doesn't know, of course, that one of the men being crucified is the same boy who visited Petook's family so long ago. On Easter morning, three days later, a new brood of chicks hatches, and once again Petook crows for joy. This tale is one of the most evocative Easter stories ever written; it conveys not only the joy of new life but also the simplicity and gentleness of a boy who grew up to be a great leader. As in his earlier illustrations for religious stories, dePaola proves himself to be a master at blending religious reverence with familiar details. The sun-drenched colors, accented with vibrant reds and yellows, reflect the serenity of the story and subtly draw the reader's attention to the beauty and inner message of Easter. Ages 5-8. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreSchool-Grade 3 Petook is a snowy white rooster immensely proud of his wife's new brood of chicks and quick to protect them from an intruding young boy. But as soon as he sees the child kneeling in wonder by the hen with her chicks gathered under her wings, Petook is soothed and crows happily. Years afterward, Petook, whose home is in sight of Calvary's hill, is awaiting another hatching and becomes strangely agitated when he sees men being lifted onto the crosses there. But three days later on Easter morning, as the first chick bursts forth from its shell, Petook is inspired to rejoice with a veritable symphony of crows, celebrating the mystery of new life. Beautifully written in poetic, pictorial language and illustrated with dePaola's usual mastery, this oblique view of the Easter miracle touches upon Christian themesthe gentleness of the boy Jesus, the symbolism of the hen and chickens, the mystical joy of resurrection and renewalwith delicate sensitivity. The pictures, with their elegantly simplified forms and clear, soft colors, are arranged with dynamic symmetry in an arresting layout and have a timeless, meditative quality perfect for their theme.

To Lieutenant Alberto Conti, the iridescent waves reminded him of a Monet waterscape viewed in a darkened room. The silvery froth reflected the moonlight back to the sky, illuminating a bank of clouds far to the north, the fringe of a storm that was soaking the fertile coast of South Africa some fifty miles away.</p><p>Tucking his chin from the moist breeze that buffeted him, Conti turned to face a young seaman standing watch beside him on the conning tower of the Italian submarine <i>Barbarigo</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;A romantic evening, Catalano, is it not?&#x201d;</p><p>The sailor gave him a quizzical look. &#x201c;The weather is quite pleasant, sir, if that&#x2019;s what you mean.&#x201d; Though fatigued like the rest of the crew, the seaman still held a rigid demeanor in the presence of officers. It was a youthful piety, Conti considered, one that would eventually vanish.</p><p>&#x201c;No, the moonlight,&#x201d; Conti said. &#x201c;I bet it shines over Naples tonight as well, glistening off the cobblestone streets. It wouldn&#x2019;t surprise me, in fact, if a handsome officer of the Wehrmacht isn&#x2019;t escorting your fianc�e on a stroll about Piazza del Plebiscito at this very moment.&#x201d;</p><p>The young sailor spat over the side, then faced the officer with burning eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;My Lisetta would sooner jump off the Gaiola Bridge than associate with any German pig. I do not worry, for she carries a sap in her pocketbook while I&#x2019;m away, and she knows how to use it.&#x201d;</p><p>Conti let out a deep laugh. &#x201c;Perhaps if we armed all of our women, then neither the Germans nor the Allied Forces would dare set foot in our country.&#x201d;</p><p>Having been at sea for weeks, and away from his homeland for months more, Catalano found little humor in the comment. He scanned the horizon, then nodded toward the dark, exposed bow as their submarine sliced through the waves.</p><p>&#x201c;Sir, why have we been relegated to transport duty for the Germans rather than the merchant raiding, for which the <i>Barbarigo</i> was built?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all puppets on the F�hrer&#x2019;s string these days, I&#x2019;m afraid,&#x201d; Conti replied, shaking his head. Like most of his countrymen, he had no idea that forces were at work in Rome that would, in a matter of days, oust Mussolini from power and announce an armistice with the Allies. &#x201c;To think that we had a larger submarine fleet than the Germans in 1939, yet we now take our operational orders from the Kriegsmarine,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;The world is not so easily explained at times.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t seem right.&#x201d;</p><p>Conti gazed across the sub&#x2019;s large forward deck. &#x201c;I guess the <i>Barbarigo</i> is too big and slow for the latest armed convoys, so we are now little more than a freighter. At least we can say our <i>Barbarigo</i> attained a proud wartime record before her conversion.&#x201d;</p><p>Launched in 1938, the <i>Barbarigo</i> had sunk a half dozen Allied ships in the Atlantic during the early days of the war. Displacing over a thousand tons, she was much larger than the feared Type VII U-boats of the German wolf pack. But as German surface ship losses began to mount, Admiral D�nitz suggested converting several of the large Italian <i>sommergibili</i> into transport vessels. Stripped of her torpedoes, deck gun, and even one of her heads, the <i>Barbarigo</i> had been sent to Singapore as a cargo vessel, filled with mercury, steel, and 20mm guns for the Japanese.</p><p>&#x201c;Our return cargo is deemed highly critical to the war effort, so somebody has to act as the mule, I suppose,&#x201d; Conti said. But deep down, he was angered by the transport duty. Like every submariner, he had something of the hunter in him, a longing to stalk the enemy. But now an enemy encounter would mean death for the <i>Barbarigo</i>. Stripped of its weaponry and floundering along at twelve knots, the submarine was more a sitting duck than a feared attacker.</p><p>As a white-tipped wave splashed against the bow, Conti glanced at his illuminated wristwatch.</p><p>&#x201c;Less than an hour to sunrise.&#x201d;</p><p>Heeding the unspoken command, Catalano hoisted a pair of binoculars and scanned the horizon for other vessels. The lieutenant followed suit, circling the conning tower with his eyes, taking in the sea and sky. His thoughts drifted to Casoria, a small town north of Naples, where his wife and young son awaited him. A vineyard grew behind their modest farmhouse, and he suddenly longed for the lazy summer afternoons when he would chase his boy through the sprouting vines.</p><p>Then he heard it.</p><p>Over the drone of the submarine&#x2019;s twin diesel engines, he detected a different sound, something of a high-pitched buzz. Snapping erect, he didn&#x2019;t waste time fixing a position.</p><p>&#x201c;Secure the hatch!&#x201d; he cried.</p><p>He immediately dropped down the interior ladder. The emergency dive alarm rang out an instant later, sending the crew scurrying to their stations. In the engine room, a massive clutch was engaged, killing the diesel engines and transferring drive power to a bank of battery-powered electric motors. Seawater began to slosh across the forward deck as Catalano sealed the conning tower hatch, then descended to the control room.</p><p>Normally, a well-trained crew could crash-dive a submarine in under a minute. But since it was loaded to the gills in transport mode, there was little the Italian sub could do quickly. With agonizing leisure, it finally sagged under the surface nearly two minutes after Conti had detected the approaching aircraft.</p><p>His boots clanking on the steel ladder as he descended into the control room, Catalano turned and scurried forward to his emergency dive station. The clatter of the diesel engines had fallen quiet as the sub converted to battery propulsion, and the crew mirrored the silence by speaking in hushed tones. The <i>Barbarigo</i>&#x2019;s skipper, a round-faced man named De Julio, stood rubbing sleep from his eyes as he asked Conti if they&#x2019;d been seen.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say. I didn&#x2019;t actually see the aircraft. But the moon is bright and the seas are relatively calm. I am sure we are visible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We will know soon enough.&#x201d;</p><p>The captain stepped to the helm station, scanning the depth gauge. &#x201c;Take us to twenty meters, then full right rudder.&#x201d;</p><p>The submarine&#x2019;s chief steersman nodded as he repeated the command, eyeing the gauges before him as his grip tightened on a large metal steering wheel. The control room fell silent as the men awaited their fate.</p><p>A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THEM, a lumbering British PBY Catalina flying boat released two depth charges that whirled toward the sea like a pair of spinning tops. The aircraft was not yet equipped with radar; it was the RAF plane&#x2019;s rear gunner who had spotted the milky wake of the <i>Barbarigo</i>, angling across the rippled surface. Thrilled with his find, he pressed his nose against the acrylic window, wide-eyed, as the twin explosives splashed into the sea. Seconds later, two small geysers of spray shot into the air.</p><p>&#x201c;A bit late, I believe,&#x201d; the copilot said.</p><p>&#x201c;I suspected as much.&#x201d; The pilot, a tall Londoner who wore a clipped mustache, banked the Catalina in a tight turn with all the emotion of pouring a cup of tea.</p><p>Dropping the charges was something of a guessing game, as the submarine had already disappeared from view, though its surface wake was still visible, and the plane had to strike quickly. The airborne depth charges activated at a preset depth of only twenty-five feet. Given enough time, the sub would easily dive beyond their range.</p><p>The pilot lined up for another run, tracking a marker buoy they had released ahead of the initial attack. Eyeing the remnants of the sub&#x2019;s fading wake, he gauged the vessel&#x2019;s unseen path, then gunned the pig-bellied Catalina just past the buoy.</p><p>&#x201c;Coming up on her,&#x201d; he told the bombardier. &#x201c;Release if you&#x2019;ve got a target.&#x201d;</p><p>The bombardier for the eight-man crew sighted the sub and flipped a toggle switch, releasing a second pair of depth charges stowed under the Catalina&#x2019;s wings.</p><p>&#x201c;Depth charges away. Spot-on this time, I&#x2019;d say, Flight Lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s try one more for good measure, then see if we can raise a surface ship in the vicinity,&#x201d; the pilot replied, already banking the plane hard over.</p><p>INSIDE THE <i>BARBARIGO</i>, the twin blasts shook the bulkheads with a deep shudder. The overhead lights flickered and the hull groaned, but no rush of water penetrated the interior. For a moment, the explosion&#x2019;s deafening roar seemed to be the worst consequence, ringing in each crewman&#x2019;s ears like the bells of St. Peter&#x2019;s Basilica. But then the ringing was overpowered by a metallic clang that reverberated from the stern, followed by a high-pitched squeal.</p><p>The captain felt a slight change in the vessel&#x2019;s trim. &#x201c;Fore and aft damage reports,&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s our depth?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Twelve meters, sir,&#x201d; the pilot said.</p><p>No one in the control room spoke. A cacophony of hisses and creaks permeated the compartment as the sub dove deeper. But it was the sound they didn&#x2019;t hear that prickled their ears&#x2014;the splash and click of a pair of depth charges detonating alongside the submerged vessel.</p><p>The Catalina had dropped wide on its last pass, its pilot guessing north while the <i>Barbarigo</i> veered south. The last muffled explosions barely buffeted the submarine as it plunged beneath the reach of the depth charges. A collective sigh was expelled as, to a man, the crew realized they were safe for the time being. Their only fear now would be if an Allied surface ship could be summoned to renew the attack.</p><p>Their relief was cut short by a cry from the steersman.</p><p>&#x201c;Captain, we seem to be losing speed.&#x201d;</p><p>De Julio stepped close and examined a bank of gauges near the pilot&#x2019;s seat.</p><p>&#x201c;The electrical motors are operational and engaged,&#x201d; the young sailor said, wrinkling his brow. &#x201c;But I show no revolutions on the driveshaft.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have Sala report to me at once.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; A sailor near the periscope turned to retrieve the <i>Barbarigo</i>&#x2019;s chief engineer. He&#x2019;d taken only two steps when the engineer appeared in the aft passageway.</p><p>Chief Engineer Eduardo Sala moved like a bulldozer, his squat frame churning forward in a blunt gait. He approached the captain and stared at him with harsh black eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Sala, there you are,&#x201d; the captain said. &#x201c;What is our operational status?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The hull is secure, sir. We do have heavy leakage at the main shaft seal, which we are attempting to stem. I can report one injury, Engineer Parma, who fell and broke his wrist during the attack.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Very well, but what about the propulsion? Are the electric motors disabled?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, sir. I disengaged the main drive motors.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you crazy, Sala? We were under attack and you disengaged the motors?&#x201d;</p><p>Sala looked at the captain with contempt.</p><p>&#x201c;They are irrelevant now,&#x201d; he said quietly.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you saying?&#x201d; De Julio asked, wondering why the engineer was evasive.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the screw,&#x201d; Sala said. &#x201c;A blade was bent or warped by the depth charge. It made contact with the hull and sheared off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;One of the blades?&#x201d; De Julio asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the entire screw.&#x201d;</p><p>The words hung in the air like a death knell. Absent its single screw propeller, the <i>Barbarigo</i> would be tossed about the sea like a cork. Its home port of Bordeaux suddenly seemed as far away as the moon.</p><p>&#x201c;What can we do?&#x201d; the captain said.</p><p>The gruff engineer shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing but pray,&#x201d; he said softly. &#x201c;Pray for the mercy of the sea.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>JUNE 2014</p><p>MOJAVE DESERT, CALIFORNIA</p><p>IT WAS A MYTH, THE MAN DECIDED, AN OLD WIVES&#x2019; tale. Often he had heard how the desert&#x2019;s broiling daytime temperatures gave way to freezing cold at night. But in the high desert of Southern California in July, he could testify, that wasn&#x2019;t the case. Sweat soaked the underarms of his thin black sweater and pooled in a damp mass around his lower back. The temperature was still at least ninety degrees. He glanced at his luminescent watch, verifying it was indeed two in the morning.</p><p>The heat didn&#x2019;t exactly overwhelm him. He&#x2019;d been born in Central America and had lived and fought guerrilla campaigns in the region&#x2019;s jungles his entire life. But the desert was new to him, and he simply hadn&#x2019;t expected the nighttime heat.</p><p>He gazed across the dusty landscape to a conglomeration of glowing streetlamps. They marked the entrance to a large open-pit mining complex spread across the hills before him.</p><p>&#x201c;Eduardo should nearly be in place opposite the guard station,&#x201d; he said to a bearded man lying prone in a nearby sandy depression.</p><p>He was similarly clad in black, from combat boots to the thin stocking cap pulled low over his head. Sweat glistened off his face as he sipped from a water bottle.</p><p>&#x201c;I wish he would hurry. There are rattlesnakes around here.&#x201d;</p><p>His partner grinned in the dark. &#x201c;Juan, that would be the least of our problems.&#x201d;</p><p>A minute later, the handheld radio on his belt chirped with two static transmissions.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s him. Let&#x2019;s move.&#x201d;</p><p>They arose and put on light backpacks. Lights from the mine buildings were sprinkled across the hillside in front of them, casting a pale glow over the barren desert. They hiked a short distance to a chain-link fence that encircled the complex. The taller man knelt and rummaged through his pack for a pair of wire cutters.</p><p>&#x201c;Pablo,...</p></p><h2>At Home: Special Illustrated Edition: A Short History of Private Life</h2><p><b>From one of our most beloved authors, a fascinating excursion into the history behind the place we call home&#x2014;now richly illustrated with more than three hundred images.</b><br><br>National bestseller <i>At Home</i> is Bill Bryson&#x2019;s epic chronicle of domestic history.

From architecture to electricity, from food preservation to epidemics, from the telephone to the Eiffel Tower, from crinolines to toilets&#x2014;and the brilliant, creative, and often eccentric minds behind them&#x2014;Bryson demonstrates that whatever happens in the world ends up in our houses, in the paint and the pipes and the pillows and every item of furniture.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2010</strong>: Bill Bryson (<i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i>) turns his attention from science to society in his authoritative history of domesticity, <i>At Home: A Short History of Private Life</i>. While walking through his own home, a former Church of England rectory built in the 19th century, Bryson reconstructs the fascinating history of the household, room by room. With waggish humor and a knack for unearthing the extraordinary stories behind the seemingly commonplace, he examines how everyday items--things like ice, cookbooks, glass windows, and salt and pepper--transformed the way people lived, and how houses evolved around these new commodities. "Houses are really quite odd things," Bryson writes, and, luckily for us, he is a writer who thrives on oddities. He gracefully draws connections between an eclectic array of events that have affected home life, covering everything from the relationship between cholera outbreaks and modern landscaping, to toxic makeup, highly flammable hoopskirts, and other unexpected hazards of fashion. Fans of Bryson's travel writing will find plenty to love here; his keen eye for detail and delightfully wry wit emerge in the most unlikely places, making <i>At Home</i> an engrossing journey through history, without ever leaving the house. <em>--Lynette Mong</em><br> <br><b>Bill Bryson</b>&#x2019;s many bestselling books include <i>A Walk in the Woods</i>, <i>I&#x2019;m a Stranger Here Myself</i>, <i>In a Sunburned Country</i>, <i>Bryson&#x2019;s Dictionary of Troublesome Words</i>, <i>A Short History of Nearly Everything</i> (which earned him the 2004 Aventis Prize), <i>The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid</i>, and <i>Bryson&#x2019;s Dictionary for Writers and Editors</i>.

Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail. Maybe that's because if you squint your eyes and look sideways, shrimp are kind of dragonlike, and I was eating them in the right company!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--Shelly Shapiro, Executive EditorThe Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

There is no distinction between the two worlds-The Creator&#39;s Law governs all. It has always been like that, since the beginning. &#34;The Creator made our people and gave us the laws on how we&#39;re supposed to conduct ourselves,&#34; explains Danny Billie, spokesperson for the Independent Traditional Seminole Nation, which consists of about 300 people in the midst of the Florida Everglades. He is trying to keep that law: the Creator&#39;s Law, the Breathmaker&#39;s Law. The Independent Traditional Seminole Nation of Florida steadfastly keeps their traditions-language, culture, housing, ceremony, and way of life-against the forces of colonialism, assimilation, globalization and all that eats cultures. Their presence in the Native community provides a yardstick against which to measure your own values, your own way of life, and your choices. That is the lesson they will teach without speaking. And that is a great gift. In the center of their Chickee (traditional house) they keep a fire-always, it seems. It is the fire of culture, the fire of life. I am not so different. I tend my fire, that one in the woodstove, which keeps my northern house warm. Watch the fire, nurture it, and it will feed your soul and warm your body. Leave the fire, and it may get away from you. That lesson is worth remembering. The Panther Clan of the Seminole Nation consider the Florida panther their closest animal relative. There are only about fifty of these panthers left. Both the panther and the Seminole have fought for their land and they intend to remain there. But industrialization and the drive for profit are squeezing the lifeblood out of the Everglades, and it&#39;s not possible for the Seminole and panther alone to change that. Two hundred years ago, the Seminoles and the animals had most of the Everglades to themselves. Blooming flowers of every shape and color were intertwined with the textured green of shrubs, grasses, and trees. Small hills rose among the great waterways, in whose fertile soils the Seminoles planted small gardens. In their massive dugout canoes, they travelled as far as Cuba and the Bahamas. At home, they prayed for and feasted on fish and animals, and made their shelter from the great cypress swamps and palm trees. From other plants they made their medicines, and each day they gave thanks to the Creator for their way of life. To the Seminole, like other Indigenous people, the way of life is a ceremony in itself, and they acknowledge it historically and today through a language called Hitchiti. The Seminoles, it is said, had once been closely affiliated with the Creeks. Their name, Seminoles, came from a Creek word meaning &#34;runaway,&#34; or &#34;wild,&#34; or alternatively, &#34;people of the distant fire.&#34; When they decided to keep to themselves, they started an independent, village-based system of governance. But their land was coveted. First by the Spaniards, who imagined a Fountain of Youth amidst the sea of grass, pink flamingos, blue herons, and brilliantly colored birds, and then by the Americans, who, as time would tell, coveted all.</p><h2>Complete Divine: A Player's Guide to Divine Magic for all Classes (Dungeons &amp; Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying Supplement)</h2><p>The most detailed resource ever released on accessing divine power and divine favor in the D&amp;D world.<br><br><i>Complete Divine</i> provides Dungeons &amp; Dragons� players with an in-depth look at how to gain the favor of the gods and use that power to a character's advantage.

Not sure what to do next.<br><br> I should have known it was too good to last.<br><br> I had spent the last two months at Kilhenny Castle, Darcy's ancestral home. I had experienced the merriest Christmas I had ever known, with Darcy, his eccentric family and the Polish princess Zou Zou Zamanska. We had fought hard to prove Lord Kilhenny's innocence when he was wrongly accused of a crime and had managed to gain back his castle. The next month was spent making it habitable again. It had been a wonderful, almost miraculous time to be close to the man I loved, to actually be planning our wedding in the summer. Darcy had also been helping his father to restore the racing stable, now owned by the princess, to its former glory and they had succeeded in winning the gold cup at the Punchestown races.<br><br> But all good things must come to an end. Darcy had never been the sort to stay in one place for long. Neither had the princess. She had flitted between Ireland and London in her little aeroplane as casually as if she was going down to the corner shop for a loaf of bread. Then one day in March she announced that she was leaving to enter a round-the-world air race. Darcy's father, usually never one to let his feelings show, had stomped around miserably for days after she had gone. They were clearly fond of each other, but as far as I knew he hadn't declared his love for her. Perhaps his stupid pride made him think that he didn't have enough to offer her, either in rank or in fortune. Not that she would have cared. Zou Zou, as she liked her friends to call her, was one of the most open and generous people I have ever met. And I think she had definitely fallen for the roguish Lord Kilhenny. Who wouldn't? He had the same rugged good looks and wicked twinkle in his eye as his son!<br><br> Then shortly after Zou Zou flew off in her tiny plane, Darcy came to me and said he'd have to leave for a while. He had an assignment that he couldn't refuse. Even though we were engaged to be married he had never revealed to me for whom he was actually working, although he had dropped hints that it was the British secret service.<br><br> "How long will you be gone, do you think?" I asked, trying to look light and cheerful.<br><br> "I have no idea," he said.<br><br> "And I suppose you can't tell me where you'll be going or what you'll be doing?"<br><br> He grinned then. "You know I can't. And actually I don't know myself yet."<br><br> I stood there, looking at him, thinking how incredibly handsome he was with those wild dark curls and alarming blue eyes. I took his hands. "Darcy, will it be like this when we're married?" I asked and heard a little catch in my voice. "Will you always be going off somewhere and leaving me at home to worry about you?"<br><br> "You don't need to worry about me," he said. "I'm a big boy. I can take good care of myself. But as to what I do when we're married, we'll just have to play it by ear. Maybe we'll move back here to the castle and raise our children the way I was raised. But I want to make enough money to provide for you. You know that."<br><br> "Yes, I know," I said, fighting back an embarrassing tear, "but I'll miss you."<br><br> "I'll miss you too, you silly old thing." He stroked back a curl from my cheek. "I'll be in London first," he added. "I'll make an appointment to see the king's private secretary and see how things are progressing."<br><br> He was talking about our wedding, of course. In case you don't know, I am the daughter of the Duke of Rannoch, great-granddaughter to Queen Victoria and second cousin to the king. As such I am part of the line of succession-currently thirty-fifth in line to the throne. And members of the royal family are not allowed by law to marry Catholics. Darcy was a Catholic so the only way to be allowed to marry him was to renounce my claim to the throne. This was all rather silly as there was little likelihood that I'd find myself crowned Queen of England (not unless there was a plague or flood of biblical proportions). But the whole thing had to be done properly. Darcy had presented a petition on my behalf. Then it had to be approved by Parliament. The petition had been presented, but we had heard nothing. So the wedding date was in limbo and it was most unsettling. I rather wished we had managed to reach Gretna Green, as Darcy had once tried to do, and been married in secret.<br><br> But left alone in the Irish countryside, now doubts crept into my mind. What if Parliament refused to let me renounce my claim? Could we defy them and marry? We'd have to leave England and live abroad if necessary because I was going to marry Darcy. Nothing was going to stop me. But it was an unsettling time, suddenly finding myself alone at Kilhenny Castle with Darcy's father. He had never been the most genial of men. Now he was clearly worried about Zou Zou so he went around with a scowl on his face and became annoyed by the smallest of things-much the way he had been when I first arrived there in December.<br><br> I, in turn, was worried about Darcy, about the future of our marriage and to what dangerous part of the globe he might be sent. More than anything I wondered what I should be doing next. I sensed that Lord Kilhenny welcomed my company and would sink into deeper gloom if I left. And yet I felt lonely, unsettled and out of place in Ireland. I enjoyed visits to Darcy's eccentric great-aunt and great-uncle, who lived in a rambling old house nearby, as well as walks through the countryside, where roadside hedges were now blooming with spring flowers and the air smelled of spring. But I wanted to be gone.<br><br> My thoughts often turned to my friend Belinda who had fled to Italy to have a baby that no one should know about. Was she feeling equally lonely? She had suggested when I last saw her that I come and stay with her in Italy, but I had heard nothing since and had no address in Italy to write to. I hoped she was all right. I also worried about my grandfather in London. I had written to him several times, but had heard nothing in return since Christmas, when I had received a rather lurid card and a box of Quality Street chocolates. I knew he wasn't much of a writer, but I was concerned about his health. He had a weak chest and the London fogs were often brutal in winter. I would have gone to London to visit him, but I had nowhere to stay. My brother, the current duke, owned our family home, Rannoch House on Belgrave Square, but he and my dreaded sister-in-law, Fig, had gone to the south of France for the winter and Fig had made it clear to me that I was not to use their house while they were gone.<br><br> Zou Zou had also said that I was always welcome to stay with her when I was in London, but she was on a round-the-world race, which might take months. So I stayed on in Ireland, rushing to the post every morning in the hope of news from somebody. And then one morning I went out for an early walk. It was a perfect spring day. Daffodils were blooming all over the castle grounds. Birds were singing madly in the trees, which now sported new buds. The air smelled fresh and fragrant. It was the sort of day to go for a long ride, but the only horses at Kilhenny these days were at the racing stable and I didn't think Darcy's father would trust me with one of his prized mounts.<br><br> I was halfway down the path to the front gate when I met the postman, coming toward me on his bicycle.<br><br> "Top of the morning, my lady," he said, coming to a halt beside me. "'Tis a grand day, is it not? And a letter for yourself from London, no less."<br><br> He handed it to me. A fat envelope. I looked for Darcy's black, impatient scrawl, but instead I saw my brother's handwriting. So they were home in England again.<br><br> "I see there's a crest on the back of that envelope," the postman said, eyeing it curiously. "So it's from some lord or lady, is it? I expect it's important, then."<br><br> He was hovering, waiting for me to open it. Although I was dying to know why my brother might be writing to me after such a long silence, I certainly wasn't going to open it with the postman peering over my shoulder, ready to spread the news to the rest of the village.<br><br> "Thank you very much," I said. "I'd better go indoors and read it, hadn't I?"<br><br> I saw him watching me with disappointment as I went back up the path to the castle. Once inside I went into the dining room and poured myself a cup of coffee. There was no sign of Darcy's father. He went to the stables at the crack of dawn most mornings and I had become used to eating breakfast alone. I had just sat down when the housekeeper, Mrs. McCarthy, came into the room bringing a dish of smoked haddock.<br><br> She started when she saw me. "Oh, your ladyship, I didn't know you were already up, and me with no breakfast ready for you."<br><br> "Please don't worry, Mrs. McCarthy," I said. "I was going out for a walk and then I met the postman and he had a letter for me, so I wanted to come inside and read it right away."<br><br> "Oh, how lovely. A letter for you." She beamed with pleasure. "It's not from Mr. Darcy himself, is it?"<br><br> "Unfortunately, no," I said.<br><br> "My, but that's a grand crest on the envelope," she said, hovering behind me with the dish of haddock still in her hands.<br><br> "It's from my brother, the Duke of Rannoch," I said.<br><br> "Oh, your brother. Well, isn't that grand." She showed no sign of moving away. I was beginning to think that curiosity was a local trait. "No doubt he's got some news for you. That looks like it could be a long letter."<br><br> "Well, he's just come back from the south of France," I said. "I expect he's giving me a full report on his time there."<br><br> "Oh, the Riviera. Now, isn't that grand? I expect they had a lovely time there. All those yachts and things."<br><br> It was quite clear she didn't plan to move.<br><br> "Don't you think you should put the dish of haddock onto the warming tray or it will get cold?" I said.<br><br> She chuckled. "Would you look at me. I'd quite forgotten I'd got the thing in my hands."<br><br> As she headed for the sideboard with the various breakfast dishes on it I opened the envelope. Two more letters fell out as well as one page of writing paper with the Rannoch crest on it. I read that first.<br><br> My dear Georgiana,<br><br> I hope this finds you in good health. We were not sure where to send the enclosed, but I'm mailing them to O'Mara's address in Ireland in the hope that you might still be there. We did read in the English newspapers about the amazing turn of events concerning Lord Kilhenny and I must say I am very glad for you that he was cleared of any wrongdoing.<br><br> We arrived back from Nice to find the enclosed letters waiting on the hall table. It appears they had been posted some time ago, but the house had been shut up with no servants until we returned home. I see one of the letters comes from Buckingham Palace. I do hope it was nothing urgent. I took the liberty of dropping a line to Their Majesties' private secretary to say we had all been out of the country and I was forwarding the letter to you.<br><br> We all had a splendid time at Foggy and Ducky's villa-well, not exactly splendid. It was a trifle crowded. The term "villa" is actually somewhat of an overstatement. It's an ordinary small house on a backstreet in Nice, but is within walking distance of the sea. The water was too cold for bathing, but we took some nice walks. Podge was disgusted that the beach was not sandy, but he's a good little chap and amused himself well.<br><br> We'll be in London for a couple of weeks before we head back to Scotland and look forward to hearing from you.<br><br> Your affectionate brother,<br><br> Binky<br><br> I looked up. Mrs. McCarthy had now deposited the haddock on its warming tray and had returned to hover behind me.<br><br> "All is well, I trust, your ladyship?" she asked.<br><br> I folded the letter. "Thank you, Mrs. McCarthy. All is indeed well. And I think I'll leave the other letters until I've enjoyed your delicious smoked haddock."<br><br> I think I heard her sigh as she admitted defeat and went back to the kitchen.<br><br> When I had finished my breakfast I retreated to my bedroom and opened the other letters. The royal one first, naturally. It was from the queen, not dictated to a secretary but written with her own hand.<br><br> My dear Georgiana,<br><br> I trust you are well. I understand from the king's secretary that your young man has indicated that you wish to marry him and, given his Catholic faith, have expressed yourself willing to abandon your place in the line of succession.<br><br> This is indeed a big step, Georgiana, and one not to be undertaken without a great deal of thought. I would expect to hear from your lips that this is indeed your intention and that you are quite sure of the ramifications. To that end I hope you will come to the palace and we can discuss your situation over tea. Please let my secretary know when might be a convenient date for you.<br><br> His Majesty sends you his warmest wishes, as do I,<br><br> Mary R.<br><br> (You'll notice that even in an informal letter to a cousin she was still Mary Regina. One never stops being a queen.)<br><br> I stared at the letter for a long time while my stomach twisted itself into knots. Did this mean that they might not approve the marriage, nor give me permission to abandon my claim to the throne? It all seemed so silly. They had four healthy sons and already two granddaughters, with the promise of many more grandchildren to come. I should go to London immediately and sort things out with her. Let her know that I intended to marry Darcy no matter what. I felt my stomach give an extra little twist when that thought popped into my mind. Queen Mary was a rather terrifying person. I had never crossed her in my life before. I don't believe many people have dared to do so. The only exception being her son and heir, the Prince of Wales. She had let him know quite clearly that she did not approve of his friendship with the American woman Mrs. Simpson. Not only was that lady currently married to someone else, but she had already been divorced once. The Church of England, of which the king is the head, does not countenance divorce. I don't think the queen ever believed that her son would contemplate marriage to such a person. She trusted that he would do the right thing when the time came and make a suitable match, like his younger brother George, whose wedding to the Greek princess Marina I had just attended.</p><h2>Hammer and Axe: Dwarven Nations Trilogy, Vol 2 (Dragonlance)</h2><p>When the humans of Ergoth threaten Thorbardin, the clans of Thorbardin are drawn into territorial wars between humans and elves.

In Harrison's earnest, initially riveting new novel, narrator David Burkett decides as a teenager in the 1960s that he must rectify the ecological damage done to his beloved Upper Peninsula area of Michigan by his rapacious timber baron ancestors. More immediately, he vows to tell the world about the rapes and abuses committed by his alcoholic father, a charismatic Yale graduate with an egregious sense of entitlement. After a foray into organized religion, David finds spiritual solace in the stark natural world, described by Harrison in soaring prose. Unable to sustain emotional connection with any woman other than his older sister, David has brief liaisons with four women, but he feels more pain over the death of his dog than of his marriage. Meanwhile, he spends decades working on a history of his despised family, only to realize that he is a dud as a writer. By this time, he's in his late 30s, a man who has never achieved maturity because his father hangs like an albatross around his neck. A master of surprise endings (<i>Dalva</i>, etc.), Harrison pulls off a bravura climax when David attempts to reconcile with his feckless father. By this time, though, the reader may have tired of the monochromatic narrative, composed mainly of David's anguished introspection and depressed dreams. Still, Harrison's tragic sense of history and his ironic insight into the depravities of human nature are as potent as ever and bring deeper meaning to his (eventually) redemptive tale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dowsers find water, the second sight warns of dangers to come, and a torch can read a person's future---or their heart.<br>In this world where "knacks" abound, Alvin, the seventh son of a seventh son, is a very special man indeed. He's a Maker; he has the knack of understanding how things are put together, how to create them, repair them, keep them whole, or tear them down. He can heal hearts as well as bones, he build a house, he can calm the waters or blow up a storm. And he can teach his knack to others, to the measure of their own talent.</p><p>Alvin has been trying to avert the terrible war that his wife, Peggy, a torch of extraordinary power, has seen down the life-lines of every American. Now she has sent him down the Mizzippy to the city of New Orleans, or Nueva Barcelona as they call it under Spanish occupation. Alvin doesn't know exactly why he's there, but when he and his brother-in-law, Arthur Stuart, find lodgings with a family of abolitionists who know Peggy, he suspects he'll find out soon. </p><p>But Nueva Barcelona is about to experience a plague, and Alvin's efforts to protect his friends by keeping them healthy will create more danger than he could ever have suspected. And in saving the poor people of the city, Alvin will be put to the greatest test of his life---a test that will draw on all his power. For the time has come for him to turn to his old friend Tenskwa-Tawa, the Red Prophet who controls the lands to the west of the Mizzippy.

It was steamboats, mostly, that brought them. Even though the fog on the Mizzippy made it so a white man couldn&#x2019;t cross the river to the west bank, the steamboats could make the trip up and down the channel, carrying goods and passengers-which was the same as saying they carried money and laid it into the laps of whoever happened to be running things at the river&#x2019;s mouth.<br>These days that meant the Spanish, officially, anyway. They owned Nueva Barcelona and it had their troops all over it.<br>But the very presence of those troops said something. One thing it said was that the Spanish weren&#x2019;t so sure they could hold on to the city. Wasn&#x2019;t that many years since the place was called New Orleans and there was still plenty of places in the city where you better speak French or you couldn&#x2019;t find a bite to eat or a place to sleep&#x2014;and if you spoke Spanish there, you might just wake up with your throat slit.<br>It didn&#x2019;t surprise Alvin much to hear Spanish and French mingling on the docks. What surprised him was that practically everybody was talking English&#x2014;usually with heavy accents, but it was English, all the same.<br>"Guess you learnt all that Spanish for nothing, Arthur Stuart," said Alvin to the half-black boy who was pretending to be his slave.<br>"Maybe so, maybe not," said Arthur Stuart. "Not like it cost me nothing to learn it."<br>Which was true. It had been disconcerting to Alvin to realize how easily the boy had picked up Spanish from a Cuban slave on the steamboat that brought them downriver. It was a good knack to have, and Alvin didn&#x2019;t have it himself, not a lick. Being a maker was good, but it wasn&#x2019;t everything. Not that Alvin needed reminding of that. There were days when he thought being a maker wasn&#x2019;t worth a wad of chawn to-backey on the parlor floor. With all his power, he hadn&#x2019;t been able to save the life of his baby, had he? Oh, he tried, but when it was born a couple of months too soon, he couldn&#x2019;t figure out how to fix its lungs from the inside so it could breathe. Turned blue and died without ever drawing air into it. No, being a maker wasn&#x2019;t worth that much.<br>Now Margaret was pregnant again, but neither she nor Alvin saw much of each other these days. Her so busy trying to prevent a bloody war over slavery. Him so busy trying to figure out what he was supposed to do with his life. Nothing he&#x2019;d ever tried to do had worked out too well. And this trip to Nueva Barcelona was gonna end up just as pointless, he was sure of it.<br>Only good thing about it was running into Abe and Coz on the journey. But now they were in Barcy, he&#x2019;d lose track of them and it&#x2019;d just be him and Arthur Stuart, continuing in their long term project of showing that you can have all the power in the world, but it wasn&#x2019;t worth much if you was too dumb to figure out what to do with it or how to share it with anybody else.<br>"You got that look again, Alvin," said Arthur Stuart.<br>"What look is that?"<br>"Like you need to piss but you&#x2019;re afraid it&#x2019;s gonna come out in chunks."<br>Alvin slapped him lightly upside his head. "You can&#x2019;t talk that way to me in this town."<br>"Nobody heard me."<br>"They don&#x2019;t have to hear you to see your attitude," said Alvin. "Cocky as a squirrel. Look around you&#x2014;you see any black folks actin&#x2019; like that?"<br>"I&#x2019;m only half black."<br>"You only got to be one-sixteenth black to be black in this town."<br>"Dang it, Alvin, how do any of these folks know they ain&#x2019;t one-sixteenth black? Nobody knows their great-great-grandparents."<br>"What do you want to bet all the white folks in Barcy can recite their ancestry back all the way?"<br>"What do you want to bet they made up most of it?"<br>"Act like you&#x2019;re afraid I&#x2019;ll whip you, Arthur Stuart."<br>"Why should I, when you never act like you&#x2019;re gonna?"<br>Now, that was a challenge, and Alvin took it up. He meant just to pretend to be mad, just a kind of roar and raise up his hand and that&#x2019;s that. Only when he did it, there was more in that roar than he meant to put there. And the anger was real and strong and he had to force himself not to lash out at the boy.<br>It was all so real that Arthur Stuart get a look of genuine fear in his eyes, and he really did cower under the threatened blow.<br>But Alvin got control of himself and the blow didn&#x2019;t fall.<br>"You did a pretty good job of looking scared," said Alvin, laughing nervously.<br>"I wasn&#x2019;t acting," said Arthur Stuart softly. "Were you?"<br>"Am I that good at it you have to ask?"<br>"No. You&#x2019;re a pretty bad liar, most times. You was <em>mad</em>."<br>"Yep, I was. But not at you, Arthur Stuart."<br>"At who, then?"<br>"Tell you the truth, I don&#x2019;t know. Didn&#x2019;t even know I was mad, till I started trying to mime it."<br>At that moment, a large hand took a hold of Alvin&#x2019;s shoulder&#x2014;not a harsh grip, but a strong one all the same. Not many men had hands so big they could hold a blacksmith&#x2019;s shoulder afore and behind.<br>"Abe," said Alvin.<br>"I was just wonderin&#x2019; what I just saw here," said Abe. "I look over at my two friends pretendin&#x2019; to be master and slave, and what do I see?"<br>"Oh, he beats me all the time," said Arthur Stuart, "when no one&#x2019;s looking."<br>"I reckon I might have to start," said Alvin, "just so&#x2019;s you won&#x2019;t be such a liar."<br>"So it was playacting?" asked Abe.<br>It shamed Alvin to have this good man even wonder, specially after spending a week together going down the Mizzippy. And maybe some of that pent-up anger was still close to the surface, because he found himself answering right sharp. "Not only was it playacting," said Alvin, "but it was also our business."<br>"And none of mine?" said Abe. "Reckon so. None of my business when one of my friends reaches out to strike another. Guess a good man&#x2019;s gotta just stand by and watch."<br>"Didn&#x2019;t hit him," said Alvin. "Wasn&#x2019;t going to."<br>"But now you want to hit me," said Abe.<br>"No," said Alvin. "Now I want to go find me a cheap inn and put up my poke afore we find something to eat. I hear Barcy&#x2019;s a good town for eatin&#x2019;, as long as you don&#x2019;t mind having fish that looks like bugs."<br>"Was that an invitation to a meal?" said Abe. "Or an invitation to go away and let you get about your business?"<br>"Mostly it was an invitation to change the subject," said Alvin. "Though I&#x2019;d be glad to have you and Coz dine with us at whatever fine establishment we locate."<br>"Oh, Coz won&#x2019;t be joinin&#x2019; us. Coz just found the love of his life, a-waitin&#x2019; for him right on the pier."<br>"You mean that trashy lady he was a-talkin&#x2019; to?" asked Arthur Stuart.<br>"I suggested to him that he might hold out for a cleaner grade of whore," said Abe, "but he denied that she was one, and she agreed that she had plain fallen in love with him the moment she saw him. So I figger I&#x2019;ll see Coz sometime tomorrow morning, drunk and robbed."<br>"Glad to know he&#x2019;s got you to look out for him, Abe," said Alvin.<br>"But I did,R</p></p><h2>Complete Dead Sea Scrolls</h2><p>A renowned biblical scholar offers, after years of legal and academic difficulties, a reliable, accurate, and complete translation of the famous Dead Sea Scrolls, ancient documents that have deeply affected our knowledge of the past and of Judeo-Christian origins. Reprint.</p><p>It's been 50 years since a Bedouin youth named Muhammed edh-Dhub went looking for a stray sheep and instead found the Dead Sea Scrolls. In the intervening decades, the scrolls have been enveloped in a storm of controversy and bitter conflict: the scholars entrusted with translating and editing the texts sat on many of them instead, creating suspicions that escalated to conspiracy theories about supposed cover-ups of sensitive, even damaging material. Geza Vermes, a former professor of Jewish studies at Oxford and a noted authority on the scrolls, marks the 50th anniversary of Muhammed edh-Dhub's find with his book <i>The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English</i>; the title, however, is misleading, for the collection of documents is by no means complete. <p> Vermes has left out the copies of Hebrew scriptures that are available elsewhere, instead focusing on the sectarian writings of the Essene community at Qumran and the intertestemental texts, and these are indeed complete translations. Vermes has also included an overview of five decades of research on the scrolls and a thumbnail sketch of the Qumran community's history and religion. For anyone interested in biblical history, <i>The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English</i> is a worthwhile read.</p>Geza Vermes&#x2019;s pioneering work on the Dead Sea Scrolls and the historical Jesus led to his appointment as the first professor of Jewish studies at Oxford University, where he is now professor emeritus.

He is an avid sailor and pilot.<b>1</b><p>ED EAGLE SAT, all six feet seven inches of him, propped up on many pillows in bed, watching Court TV on the fifty-inch flatscreen television of his suite at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles. He had decided to watch from bed rather than attend the trial of his former wife, Barbara, since he had already spent three days in the courtroom, giving his testimony against her. Now it was time for the summations.<br>The prosecutor, a woman apparently in her midthirties named Valerie Simmons, whom Eagle found quite attractive, had done a very good job in the trial, he thought, and since he was one of the half dozen best trial lawyers in the western United States, his opinion counted for something. Now all Ms. Simmons had to do was nail the lid on the thing. Eagle would have preferred nailing and screwing the lid on it, but he would settle for nailing&#x2014;anything to get Barbara into a cell for the next fifty years or so.<br>Eagle&#x2019;s girlfriend of the last year, the actress Susannah Wilde, came out of the bathroom, her hair wet, her robe hanging open. She crawled across his body, deliberately stroking his face with her breasts as she went, and snuggled up next to him.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wave those things at me,&#x201d; Eagle said. &#x201c;I have to watch Barbara go down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you rather watch me go down?&#x201d; Susannah asked, tickling his lower belly.<br>&#x201c;On another occasion, yes,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;But right now you&#x2019;re going to have to contain yourself, as difficult as that may be.&#x201d;<br>Susannah sighed and pulled herself upright next to him, plumping her pillows. &#x201c;Oh, all right,&#x201d; she said.<br>Valerie Simmons rose and walked toward the jury. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; she said to them, &#x201c;I want to thank you for your attention to what has been a lengthy trial. Now, I want to summarize the evidence against Barbara Eagle, as succinctly as I can, and I would remind you that everything I am about to say has been testified to by witnesses. You have heard from Ms. Eagle&#x2019;s former husband, Ed Eagle, how he first met Ms. Eagle when she was serving a prison sentence in New York for armed robbery and as an accessory to the killing of her first husband during that robbery. You have heard how she was released on parole and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where she renewed her acquaintance with Mr. Eagle, and how they came to be married a year or so later.<br>&#x201c;You have heard how Mr. Eagle woke up one morning, having been drugged with the sleeping pill Ambien in his wine the night before, and found his wife gone, and how she had taken more than a million dollars of his money from his bank accounts and attempted to take five million more from his brokerage accounts, something he managed to forestall.<br>&#x201c;You have heard how Mr. Eagle hired two private investigators to find his wife in Mexico, where she had fled, and how she shot one of the investigators and pushed the other overboard from a ferry in the Sea of Cortez. Both were lucky to survive. You have heard how she hired two men from Santa Fe to murder Mr. Eagle and how one of them nearly succeeded.<br>&#x201c;You have heard how she came back to the United States and checked into a resort in San Diego, where she had her appearance altered by having her dark hair dyed blond and with cosmetic surgery. You have heard how she then traveled to Los Angeles and contacted a friend, Mr. James Long, and how they had dinner together that evening at the Hotel Bel-Air. You have heard that Mr. Eagle and a friend were also dining there and how he did not recognize Ms. Eagle, because of her altered appearance.<br>&#x201c;You have heard how Ms. Eagle, later that night, drugged her companion, Mr. Long, once again with Ambien, left his home, returned to the Hotel Bel-Air and sought out the suite of Mr. Eagle. You have heard how she entered the suite next door, in error, and shot Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Dattila of New York, believing that they were Mr. Eagle and his friend.<br>&#x201c;All of this is in evidence, and the weight of it is enough for you to send Ms. Eagle to prison for the rest of her life. I ask you to do just that. Thank you.&#x201d; Valerie Simmons sat down.<br>The judge turned to the defense table. &#x201c;Mr. Karp?&#x201d; he said.<br>Richard Karp rose and faced the jury. &#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, this case is about reasonable doubt. If you believe that there is a reasonable doubt that Barbara Eagle killed Mr. and Mrs. Dattila&#x2014;and that is all that she is charged with&#x2014;then you are legally and morally bound to acquit her. Everything you have heard from the prosecution about Ms. Eagle&#x2019;s past and what she may or may not have done in Mexico is window dressing, nothing more, and none of what you have heard is supported by any material evidence, just the testimony of questionable witnesses.<br>&#x201c;While you heard Mr. Eagle testify that he was drugged with Ambien, there is no scientific evidence to support that contention. What happened was that Mr. Eagle had too much to drink the evening before and overslept. The funds that Ms. Eagle took with her to Mexico, in a desperate attempt to remove herself from an abusive marriage, were marital funds, and she was legally entitled to take them. I would remind you that one of the two men allegedly hired to kill Mr. Eagle is dead, and the other could not pick Ms. Eagle out of a lineup.<br>&#x201c;I would remind you that it is not a crime in the United States to shoot someone in Mexico in self-defense or to push someone off a boat in an attempt to defend herself from a rape, and you have heard that both of her attackers survived. I would remind you that, although Ms. Eagle and Mr. Long dined at the Bel-Air the evening before the murder, you have also heard, from Mr. Long, that she spent the entire night in his bed in his home and did not return to the Bel-Air to shoot Mr. Dattila, who, you have heard, was the son of the Mafia kingpin Carmine Dattila, who also met a violent death. It is far more likely that Thomas Dattila was killed by his own associates or competitors than by Ms. Eagle.<br>&#x201c;I would remind you that Mr. James Long underwent no testing for the drug Ambien, and he has testified that Ms. Eagle spent the night with him&#x2014;indeed, that they made love in the middle of the night. I would remind you that it is not a crime for a woman to have her appearance enhanced by her hairstylist and her cosmetic surgeon.&#x201d; He smiled knowingly.<br>&#x201c;In fact, stripped to its relevant essentials, the prosecution&#x2019;s case is nothing more than a lot of hot air, backed only by the testimony of an angry ex-husband and the two private detectives he hired to bully and harass her and to come into this court and lie about her. There is no physical evidence, no murder weapon and no motive for the murders of two people Ms. Eagle had never even met.<br>&#x201c;I put it to you that the doubt of guilt in this case is not only reasonable but overwhelming, and I ask you, after a careful examination of the evidence&#x2014;or, rather, nonevidence&#x2014;to acquit Barbara Eagle and set her free, so that she may still have a chance to find some happiness in what has, so far, been a life full of abuse and harassment by her ex-husband and others. Find her not guilty.&#x201d; Karp sat down.<br>&#x201c;What did you think?&#x201d; Susannah asked.<br>&#x201c;Well, they both said pretty much what I would have said, if I had been prosecuting or defending,&#x201d; Eagle said. &#x201c;I think the jury will convict her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; Susannah said, &#x201c;while the jury is deliberating, may I distract you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You may,&#x201d; Eagle said, rolling over and taking her in his arms.<br>SHE HAD BEEN distracting him for ten minutes or so, when Eagle was redistracted by a sudden intensity in the voice of the Court channel&#x2019;s anchor.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re just getting word,&#x201d; the anchor said, &#x201c;that something has happened outside the courtroom where the trial of Barbara Eagle has just ended. Let&#x2019;s go to our reporter on the scene for the details.&#x201d;<br>A beautiful young woman in a red suit and with perfect hair came on-screen. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, breathlessly, &#x201c;it seems that Barbara Eagle has disappeared from the conference room where she and her lawyer were awaiting a verdict. Apparently, while Mr. Karp had excused himself to go to the men&#x2019;s room, Ms. Eagle somehow got out of the conference room, in spite of a guard on the door, and maybe even out of the building. A search is being conducted for her now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ed,&#x201d; Susannah said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve gone all limp.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>BARBARA EAGLE SAT at the table in a conference room near the courtroom where she had just been tried, awaiting the jury&#x2019;s verdict. She had had lunch in this room every day during her trial, so she knew that it was on the first floor and overlooked the rear parking lot of the courthouse, reserved for judges. She knew, also, that the windows would open only ten or twelve inches, and only from the top.<br>She had been keeping her lawyer&#x2019;s water glass full for two hours, and she was waiting for results. Finally, he excused himself and went into the adjoining toilet. Barbara moved quickly. She climbed onto the windowsill, stuffed her shoes, handbag and jacket through the top opening of the window, then grabbed the bottom of the opening on the extreme left and swung her right, stockinged foot up until she could hook a toe over the edge of the window. From this point, it was all muscle, and she had had nearly a year in jail to work out. She lifted herself until she could get a knee over the edge, then continued until all that was left of her inside the room was her head, one leg and her ass. She turned to the left, and got her head out the window. From there she wriggled her ass through the window&#x2014;the dieting had helped&#x2014;then all she had to do was bring her leg outside after her.<br>She dangled from the window and took a quick look around the parking lot: a man got out of a car and went into the building through a rear door, but he wasn&#x2019;t looking up, and the parking lot was screened from the street by a high hedge. Once he was inside she dropped to the ground, a distance of some seven or eight feet, landed on the soft earth of a flower bed, behind some azalea bushes, and toppled over. She got up, brushed herself off, put on her shoes, grabbed her handbag and walked quickly across the parking lot to the row of ficus trees that had begun to grow together.<br>She pressed between them, then stopped halfway through to get a look at the street. The Toyota was parked where it was supposed to be, and Jimmy Long was at the wheel. There were no police cars or cops in sight, so she stepped out of the hedge, crossed the sidewalk, opened the rear door of the car and got in. &#x201c;Hey, Jimmy,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Hey, sweetie, we okay?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yep. Let&#x2019;s roll.&#x201d; Barbara lay low on the backseat, and the car started to move.<br>&#x201c;Where to?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The nearest place you can get a taxi.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a hotel a few blocks down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s good.&#x201d; Her luggage was sitting on the rear seat and floor, and Barbara rummaged in a bag and came out with an auburn wig and a green jacket. She tucked her hair, which was already pinned up, under the wig, sat up and checked herself out in the rearview mirror, then she got into the green jacket and stuffed her beige one into the bag. &#x201c;Okay, brief me.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The car belonged to my housekeeper&#x2019;s sister, who has a last name different from hers. I bought it and registered it in your new name, Eleanor Wright. I went to see the photographer you sent me to in Venice, and he was able to change the hair color on the last photos he took of you and make you the same package of documents he did for you before&#x2014;passport, driver&#x2019;s license, credit cards, Social Security&#x2014;all with my address on them. Ms. Wright used to rent my garage apartment, but she left a couple of months ago, if anybody asks. Everything is in a paper bag on the front passenger seat.<br>&#x201c;The car registration and insurance card are in the center armrest, along with a nontraceable cell phone, prepaid for a hundred hours of use, no GPS chip, blocked for caller ID. I went to the pawnshop in San Diego where you shopped last year and got the gun and silencer you wanted and a box of ammunition. There&#x2019;s ten thousand dollars in mixed bills in the bag, too.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a dear, do you know that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sweetheart, this is the most fun I&#x2019;ve ever had; I&#x2019;ve loved every minute of it. I took the letter you sent me and used it to transfer the money into your Eleanor Wright account, so you&#x2019;ve got a little over two hundred and fifty grand in there. You can write me a check for the ten grand, plus eighteen grand for the car, plus the twenty-five grand I paid the documents guy.&#x201d; He handed her a checkbook, and she wrote the check and handed it to him.<br>&#x201c;Oh, there&#x2019;s another bag on the seat, too, with the auburn hair dye and the book on spas you wanted. Everything you stored in my garage is in the backseat, but it will probably need pressing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jimmy, you&#x2019;re a dream. Now you&#x2019;ve got to get home before the cops show up. They&#x2019;re missing me at the courthouse by now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the hotel,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get out and hop a cab. You just drive away.&#x201d; He stopped the car.<br>She got out, gave him a hug and a kiss and got back into the car.<br>Jimmy leaned through the window. &#x201c;The car has twenty-two thousand miles on it, it&#x2019;s just been serviced and the gas tank is full. Good luck, kiddo.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in touch when I can,&#x201d; Barbara said. She put the car in gear and drove away, careful to obey all traffic laws. At the first opportunity, she pulled into a fast-food restaurant and ordered lunch from the drive-thru.<br>When she had eaten, she went through her new ID and put everything into the wallet in her handbag, then restowed her luggage in the trunk. Finally, she took the book on spas and began to read. It took her twenty minutes to find just the right place, called El Rancho, secluded on a mountaintop overlooking Palm Springs. She used her new cell phone to call.<br>&#x201c;Good morning. El Rancho,&#x201d; a woman&#x2019;s voice said.<br>&#x201c;Good morning. My name is Eleanor Wright, and I&#x2019;ve just had a sudden urge to get away from it all. Do you have any accommodation available?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see, we have a small suite at twelve hundred dollars per day and a double room at nine hundred. The suite has the better view, and the price includes all meals and drinks. No liquor is served. We offer a full range of spa activities, a beauty salon, tennis and golf half an hour&#x2019;s drive away.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the suite, please. Would you schedule me for a two-hour massage at five P.M. and make an appointment with the hairdresser and a colorist for tomorrow morning?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course. May I have a credit card number to hold your reservation?&#x201d;<br>Barbara gave it to her and got driving directions from the interstate. On the way she stopped at a liquor store and bought a bottle of good bourbon whiskey.<br>AS SOON AS she had checked into her suite, Barbara unpacked, then went into the bathroom and used the auburn hair dye, cleaning up after herself carefully. She left her hair wet and combed it back. Tomorrow, she would have a better job done by a professional. She had her massage, then dinner in her room, along with a couple of large scotches, then settled down to watch the TV coverage of her escape. Finally, she fell asleep.<br>SHE WOKE THE following morning to learn from the TV that she had been acquitted of second-degree murder. &#x201c;Holy shit!&#x201d; she said aloud.

Taking you inside the nativity of over thirty favorite songs and carols, Ace Collins introduces you to people you&#x2019;ve never met, stories you&#x2019;ve never heard, and meanings you&#x2019;d never have imagined. The next time you and your family sing "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen," you&#x2019;ll have a new understanding of its message and popular roots. You&#x2019;ll discover how "Angels from the Realms of Glory," with its sublime lyrics and profound theology, helped usher in a quiet revolution in worship. You&#x2019;ll learn the strange history of the haunting and powerful "O Holy Night," including the song&#x2019;s surprising place in the history of modern communications. And you&#x2019;ll step inside the life of Mark Lowry and find out how he came to pen the words to the contemporary classic "Mary, Did You Know?" Still other songs such as "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel" trace back to mysterious origins--to ninth-century monks, nameless clergy, and unknown commoners of ages past. Joining hands with such modern favorites as "White Christmas" and "The Christmas Song," they are part of the legacy of inspiration, faith, tears, love, and spiritual joy that is Christmas. From the rollicking appeal of "Jingle Bells" to the tranquil beauty of "Silent Night," the great songs of Christmas contain messages of peace, hope, and truth. Each in its own way expresses a facet of God&#x2019;s heart and celebrates the birth of his greatest gift to the world--Jesus, the most wonderful Christmas Song of all.</p></p><p><p>Ace Collins is the writer of more than sixty books, including several bestsellers: Stories behind the Best-Loved Songs of Christmas, Stories behind the Great Traditions of Christmas, The Cathedrals, and Lassie: A Dog&#x2019;s Life.

At its heart is its writer, an Irishman born in November of 1771. James Montgomery was born in Irvine, Ayrshire, Scotland. Montgomery&#x2019;s father, John, was an Irish Moravian missionary. When his parents were called to evangelistic work in the West Indies, the child was sent to a Moravian community in Ballymena, County Antrim, Ireland. By the time he was seven, James was at Fulneck Seminary, Yorkshire, England. Five years later, the parents James hardly knew died on the mission field. Perhaps because of the distance from and the tragic loss of his parents, Montgomery never was very interested in his schooling. Flunking out of seminary, he became a baker&#x2019;s assistant for a short time. By the age of twenty, the young man was little more than a vagrant, moving from job to job, often unemployed, and homeless for weeks at a time. Montgomery&#x2019;s only interest was writing. He spent what little money he had on pencils and paper, taking hours to com-pose poetic odes on everything from loneliness to faith. Though no publisher was interested in his work, the radical editor of the Sheffield Register saw something in the young man&#x2019;s raw talent. For the next two years Montgomery got paid to do what he most loved to do&#x2014;write stories. He also learned firsthand about the hardships of being an Irishman under English rule. At the age of twenty-three, when the newspaper&#x2019;s owner was run out of town for writing radical editorials concerning Irish freedom, the missionary&#x2019;s son took over the Register. In an attempt to quell the British government&#x2019;s wrath, Montgomery changed the paper&#x2019;s name to the Sheffield Iris. Yet he didn&#x2019;t change its editorial stance. Just as his parents had strongly rebelled against the strict rules and rituals of England&#x2019;s official church, James was bent on carrying on a written war for Ireland&#x2019;s freedom. At about that time, he also became an active leader in the abolitionist movement. His fiery editorial stance twice landed him in prison. Yet each time he was released, he returned to the Iris and continued his printed war for freedom on all fronts. When Montgomery was not waging an editorial crusade against English rule and slavery, he was reading his Bible in an attempt to understand the power that motivated his parents&#x2019; lives and ultimately led to their deaths. In time, his Scripture study and rebellious zeal would blend and send the young man on a new mission. One of the first hints of this change was revealed on Christmas Eve 1816. Irishmen, who hated all things British, probably carefully studied the newspaper each day, hoping to find some Montgomery- penned passage that would inspire more to join their revolution. It is certain that local government officials who read the Iris often wished to nail the man who was so often a thorn in their side. Yet on December 24, 1816, readers discovered a different stance from the fiery editor. On that day, his editorial did not divide Irish from English, but rather brought everyone who read the Iris closer together. Written in the same poetic verse that Montgomery had employed during the aimless wanderings of his youth, "Nativity"&#x2014; what would eventually become the carol "Angels, from the Realms of Glory"&#x2014;told the story of angels proclaiming the birth of a Savior for all people, English and Irish, rich and poor, Anglican and Moravian. Eloquent, beautiful, and scripturally sound, Montgomery soon touched more lives for Christ with the stroke of his pen than his parents did in all their years of missionary work. Still, when read between the lines, there was a bit of social commentary in "Nativity." A verse long-deleted from the carol speaks of a society that needs to right some wrongs. That lost stanza also reveals the writer&#x2019;s personal journey in finding purpose and meaning in his own life: <p>Sinners, wrung with true repentance, Doomed for guilt to endless pains, Justice now revokes the sentence; Mercy calls you. Break your chain. </p><p>As Montgomery would soon find out, his poem would break chains, but not those he had envisioned. The impact of "Nativity" would actually foreshadow the writer&#x2019;s future, since he would come to revolutionize music and thinking in the English church. As often is the case with inspired work, irony stepped in and took an important role in revealing "Nativity" to a mass audience. </p><p>Angels, from the realms of glory, Wing your flight o&#x2019;er all the earth; Ye who sang creation&#x2019;s story, Now proclaim Messiah&#x2019;s birth. Chorus: Come and worship, come and worship, Worship Christ the newborn King. Shepherds in the fields abiding, Watching o&#x2019;er your flocks by night, God with man is now residing, Yonder shines the infant Light. Chorus Sages, leave your contemplations, Brighter visions beam afar; Seek the great Desire of nations, Ye have seen His natal star. Chorus Saints before the altar bending, Watching long in hope and fear, Suddenly the Lord, descending, In His temple shall appear.

He lives in Wilton, NH.<br>So many particularly pithy passages appear in both Matthew and Luke that scholars believe those Gospels are based on an earlier compilation of the sayings of Jesus, designated Q, after the German word <i>Quelle</i>, which means "source." Scoring modern-day scholars for not previously presenting the general public with an edition of this hypothetical first gospel, editor-translators Powelson and Riegert make up the lack. They base their work, as have the Bible's English-language translators since even before the King James Version, on the wordings of previous renditions. (Why? Because Q exists entirely within the texts of Matthew and Luke.) Their versions of these, to Christians and the Christian-bred, very familiar words are crystalline and contemporary and may inspire new insight for many a reader. Meanwhile, their introduction and those by best-selling inspirational writer Thomas Moore and Jesus Seminar scholar Marcus Borg, respectively, put Q in inspirational, historical, and critical context. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Necessary as Blood (Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James Novels, 13)</h2><p><p><i>Necessary As Blood </i>is the latest entry in Deborah Crombie&#x2019;s <i>New York Times </i>Notable, Edgar�, Agatha, and Macavity Awards-nominated mystery series featuring Scotland Yard detectives Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James.

Mr. Capt reveals that there is substantial evidence to support that he did.<br>EXCERPT:&nbsp;<i>One day a small boat from one of the large merchant ships anchored in the Bristol Channel tied up at the causeway of the Lake Village. A bearded man and a slim young boy in his early teens stepped ashore. They were no strangers to the villagers who crowded around to welcome them. The merchant had been coming by their village for many years on his way to the lead mines of the Mendip Hills. It was known that he held a very important position in the powerful Roman government and carried the title "Nobilus Decurio". It was rumored that he owned many of the merchant ships that came to these Isle of the West from Rome and Phoenicia to barter for metal and other goods<br><em>The auburn haired lad was also known. He had accompanied His uncle on a prior visit staying at the village and exploring the surrounding territory while His uncle conducted his business at the nearby Mendip lead mines. But this time a woman perhaps in her early thirties was with them. As the boy helped the woman ashore the crew proceeded to unload various sized chests and sacks obviously belonging to them. Accommodations were soon found and the baggage was carried to one of the tiny huts facing the estaury.</em><br><em>In the weeks that followed the merchant and the boy constructed a wattle hut similar to those of the village on a nearby island. The site they chose was at the base of a hill from which ran a spring of fresh water. Hawthorne and oak trees dotted the landscape. Small game and fish were in abundance and the marshy fertile shores promised bountiful crops. When the hut was finished the woman and the boy moved from the village to their new home. The merchant and his men sailed away.</em><br><em>Jesus and His mother Mary were alone . . .</em></i><em><br>Excellent book...gets a top rating by all who read it.<br>Paperback<br>136 pages</em></p><p>E.

Arthur Evans discovered what he believed was the palace of King Minos, with its notorious labyrinth, home of the Minotaur. As a result, Evans became obsessed with one of the epic intellectual stories of the modern era: the search for the meaning of Linear B, the mysterious script found on clay tablets in the ruined palace.<br><br> Evans died without achieving his objective, and it was left to the enigmatic Michael Ventris to crack the code in 1952.

Treasured by the ancient Mexicans, cochineal was sold in the great Aztec marketplaces, where it attracted the attention of the Spanish conquistadors in 1519. Shipped to Europe, the dye created a sensation, producing the brightest, strongest red the world had ever seen. Soon Spain's cochineal monopoly was worth a fortune. </p><p>Desperate to find their own sources of the elusive dye, the English, French, Dutch, and other Europeans tried to crack the enigma of cochineal. Did it come from a worm, a berry, a seed? Could it be stolen from Mexico and transplanted to their own colonies? Pirates, explorers, alchemists, scientists, and spies -- all joined the chase for cochineal, a chase that lasted more than three centuries. A Perfect Red tells their stories -- true-life tales of mystery, empire, and adventure, in pursuit of the most desirable color on earth.</p></p><p><p>Amy Butler Greenfield's grandfather and great-grandfather were dyers, and she has long been fascinated by the history of color. Born in Philadelphia, she grew up in the Adirondacks and graduated from Williams College. As a Marshall Scholar at Oxford, she studied imperial Spain and Renaissance Europe. She now lives with her husband near Boston.</p>One day, Amy Butler Greenfield was sitting in a library in Seville, Spain, perusing the cargo manifests of ships of the colonial era, when she noticed how often cochineal was mentioned. Why were the Spanish shipping so much of this special red dyestuff from Mexico? Intrigued by its apparent value, she decided to unearth its history. That Greenfield also comes from a family of dyers made the scholarly detective work all the more appealing to her.<p> The result, A Perfect Red, is a fascinating history of dyeing, as craft and culture, focusing on the social and economic importance of shades of red, the most vibrant of which were reserved for royalty. In the days before synthetic colors, some red dye came from plant sources such as henna or madder and some from insects such as Laccifer lacca (the latter was ideal for lacquering or shellacking wood). But competitive dyers sought "a perfect red," by which they meant a profitable one -- a dye that was stable, easily absorbed by fabric and resistant to fading.</p><p> When Hern�n Cort�s invaded Mexico, he found a society besotted with strong sensations, from blood sports to drug-level chocolate, which the Aztecs sometimes stirred with the powdered bones of their enemies. The emperor, Montezuma, claimed the right to wear the most brilliant red and imposed on his subjects a special tax to be paid in cochineal insects, from which the vibrant dye came. The Spanish quickly monopolized the world's supply of cochineal; in 1587 alone, they shipped 65 tons of it home. Other countries soon coveted it, and the equivalent of corporate espionage ensued.</p><p> People tried like the dickens to fathom cochineal's essence. For the longest time they couldn't even agree if it came from a plant or an animal. In an era of primitive microscopes, cochineal's secrets simply defied scrutiny, spawning recklessly high bets on what it was and lots of controversy, which Greenfield chronicles.</p><p>As it happens, cochineal comes from a fragile little insect that lives on prickly pear cactus. The female produces carminic acid to annoy ants and other predators, and she is the red dye. "Pinch a female cochineal insect," Greenfield writes, "and blood-red dye pours out. Apply the dye to mordant cloth, and the fabric will remain red for centuries."</p><p>Male and female differ wildly in this species. The wingless females crawl around on their cactus, waiting for a "flying husband" to descend. It's the female's bad luck to be engorged with a red fluid precious to European hominids greedier than any cadre of ants. The males don't have it any easier, though -- they die young, after their mouthparts wither.</p><p> You'd think dyers would have bred their own cochineal insects in Europe, but the bugs are notoriously hard to ranch. For centuries, Mexicans enjoyed success by hand-rearing small numbers, which they were able to breed for size and color, eventually producing a robust new species. Even so, cochineal insects were finicky about climate, and it took 70,000 dried insects to produce one pound of red dye. The more European monarchs and gentry wore the succulent hue, the more prominently cochineal figured in society and fed or bled the economy.</p><p> Why the royal obsession with red? Red lassos the eye. When a man sees bright red (a battle uniform, say, or a red dress), he pays real attention, and his adrenal gland secretes more adrenaline to tune his body for trouble. No one can stay calm long in an eye-jolting red room. Red flames and poisonous red frogs both signal danger. Sometimes red tells tales of pleasure. In the animal world, red often indicates ripe fruit or ripe females. Coca-Cola, Campbell Soup, and many other companies flash red in their packaging to entice customers. At heart, we're fragile sacks of red fluid. Spill a little in a timely way, through menstruation, and women can produce life; spill too much and we die.</p><p> It's small wonder the word red sashays through the language, as Greenfield reminds us. Anger us, and we see red. An unfaithful woman is branded with a scarlet letter. In red-light districts, people buy carnal pleasures. We like to celebrate red-letter days and roll out the red carpet, while trying to avoid red tape, red herrings and going into the red.</p><p> Greenfield has given us a superbly researched history of cochineal red, full of angles and tangents, curiosities and arcana. Some anecdotes bog down, but most are sprightly and charming. I enjoyed learning, for example, that when 25-year-old John Donne (later to win fame as a poet) joined a massive expedition under the command of the earl of Essex, he and his fellow sailors returned home with a dusty fortune pillaged from Spanish galleons: 27 tons of pirated cochineal.</p><p> Ironically, the reds we relish occur in the mind, not in the world. Apples are everything but red -- when light hits them, only the red rays are reflected into our eyes and we think: Wow, that's red! But that happens sub rosa, a product of the brain's fancy magic. Meanwhile, on the all-too-conscious level, fashionable reds can cause designers, bank balances and empires to rise or fall. Our quest for sense-pleasers bridges the worlds of biology and society, as Greenfield discovered that day in Seville, when, researching something else entirely, she found herself knee-deep in red dye. </p><p>Reviewed by Diane Ackerman <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

Insights into Personal Growth</h2><p>John Powell applies his valuable insights into self-awareness and interpersonal communication to help us develop self-esteem and improve our relationships with others. We all fear rejection. We are afraid that people will not like us if they know what we are really like, so we often assume poses to avoid being honest with them and with ourselves. Powell identifies five levels of communication and suggests that the kinds of information we disclose determine the level or depth of our relationships. Only when we face our fears openly and honestly can we learn to like ourselves and trust that others will accept us as we really are.</p><p>This book by the author of Why Am I Afraid to Love? contains insights on self-awareness, personal growth and communication with others. Why do people continually hide their real selves from the people around them? Why are so many so insecure and afraid to open up? The answer, explains John Powell, is that maturity is reached by communicating and interacting with others. This book considers the consequences our real self faces if no one else ever finds out what we are like. In this enduring classic, the companion to Why Am I Afraid to Love?, John Powell explains how to be more emotionally open, and shows how people adopt roles and play psychological games to protect their inner selves. The courage to be our real selves can be developed, and then we can begin to grow. Now newly designed for a fresh audience, Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am? is as relevant as it has been for twenty years. With a proven track record, it continues to speak to the needs and aspirations of people today. It is best included in self help sections of general bookshops, but also has a religious appeal.John Powell, of the Society of Jesus, had a run-away success with his books Why Am I Afraid to Love? and Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am? in America in the late sixties. First published in the UK in 1975, they have remained popular ever since.</p><h2>One Minute After You Die</h2><p><p><b><br>One minute after you die, you will either be elated or terrified-and it will be too late to reroute your travel plans.<br></b>When you slip behind the parted curtain, your life will not be over.&nbsp; Rather, it will be just beginning-in a place of unimaginable bliss or indescribable gloom. <i>One Minute After You Die </i>opens a window on eternity with a simple and moving explanation of what the Bible teaches about death.<br>Bestselling author Erwin Lutzer urges readers to study what the Bible says on this critical subject, bringing a biblical and pastoral perspective to such issues as:</p><ul><li>Channeling, reincarnation, and near-death experiences,</li><li>What heaven will be like</li><li>The&nbsp;justice of eternal punishment</li><li>The death of a child</li><li>Trusting in God's providence </li><li>Preparing for your own final moment</li></ul></p><p><p><b>"One minute after you die you will either be elated or terrified.

Johnson, bestselling author of <em>He, She, We</em>, and other psychology classics, shares a lifetime of insights and experiences in this easy-to-read explanation of psychological projection &#x2014; seeing traits in others that are, in fact, our own. Drawing on early Christianity, medieval alchemy, depth psychology, and the myths of &#x201c;The Flying Dutchman&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Once and Future King,&#x201d; he also explores the subjects of loneliness, fundamentalist religion, and the spiritual dimensions of psychology.</p><p>One of the most influential and visionary analysts of his generation, Johnson follows the tradition of Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell among those whose ideas have shaped our deepest metaphors of self and psyche.

Watching is best. I learn so much from watching, and one of the things I observe most carefully is the exchange of inner gold. Inner gold is the highest value in the human psyche. It is our soul, the Self, the innermost part of our being. It is us at our best, our twenty-four carat gift to ourselves. Everyone has inner gold. It&#x2019;s not created, but it does have to be discovered. When I speak about gold this way, I&#x2019;m also speaking about God. These are two ways of describing the mystery. When we awaken to a new possibility in our lives, we see it first in another person. A part of us that has been hidden is about to emerge, but it doesn&#x2019;t go in a straight line from the unconscious to consciousness. It travels by way of an intermediary, a host. We project our gold onto someone, and suddenly we&#x2019;re consumed with him. The first inkling that something in us is changing is when we see the other person glow in the dark. That&#x2019;s a sure sign that we&#x2019;re projecting our gold. Projecting our inner gold offers us the best chance for an advance in consciousness. By observing what we attribute to the other person, we can see our own depth and meaning. Our gold goes first from us to them. Eventually it comes back to us. There are several ways we might respond when we see that we have given our spiritual gold to someone to hold for us. We could go to him or her and say, &#x201c;The meaning of my life has suddenly appeared in the glow of your eyes. May I tell you about it?&#x201d; It means, &#x201c;I seem to have given you my inner gold. Will you carry it for me for a time?&#x201d; But we rarely do that. Instead, we stand across the room, turn our back to him, and feel totally frightened, stumbling and carrying on in odd and indirect ways. We meet at the coffee pot during the morning break at work and banter with each other, speaking all kinds of nonsense. We joke and laugh, and an animated play goes on. Then, when we head back to work, we feel energized and brightened for the day. It was not the coffee. It was the inner, alchemical gold being exchanged. The exchange of gold is a mysterious process. It&#x2019;s our gold, but it&#x2019;s too heavy for us, so we need someone to carry it for a time, and he becomes synonymous with meaning. We follow him with an eagle eye wherever he goes. His smile can raise us to heavenly heights; his frown hurls us to hellish depths, so great is the power of meanng.</p><h2>The Mighty Book of Boosh</h2><p><p>Join Howard Moon, Vince Noir, Naboo, Bollo, Bob Fossil, Old Gregg, the Moon, and all your other favourite characters on a unique journey in to the world of The Mighty Boosh. </p><p>Content includes:<br>*An extract from Howard's jazz detective novel <i>Trumpet Full of Memories</i><br>*Vince's <i>Christmas Toy</i> story<br>*Bollo's letters to Peter Jackson<br>*Bob Fossil's postcards from 'Nam<br>*A new Charlie story<br>*Ol' Gregg's watercolours<br>*Naboo's guide to black magic<br>*Dixon Bainbridge's Turkish Challenge<br>*Crimp lyrics</p><p>Incredibly funny, visually dynamic, surreal, musical, wildly creative...

Paul Young has been called a heretic for the ways he vividly portrays God&#x2019;s love through his novels. Here he shares twenty-eight commonly uttered and sometimes seemingly innocuous things we say about God. Paul exposes these as lies that keep us from having a full, loving relationship with our Creator.<br> <br> With personal anecdotes and sharing the compassion readers felt from the &#x201c;Papa&#x201d; portrayed in <i>The Shack</i>&#x2014;now a major film starring Sam Worthington and Octavia Spencer&#x2014;Paul encourages readers to think anew about important issues including sin, religion, hell, politics, identity, creation, human rights, and helping us discover God&#x2019;s deep and abiding love.</p><p>William Paul Young was born in Canada and raised among a Stone Age tribe by his missionary parents in the highlands of former New Guinea. He suffered great loss as a child and young adult and now enjoys the &#x201c;wastefulness of grace&#x201d; with his family in the Pacific Northwest. He is the author of <i>Lies We Believe About God </i>and the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>The Shack</i>, <i>Cross Roads</i>, and <i>Eve</i>.Lies We Believe About God 1<p></p> &#x201c;God loves us, but doesn&#x2019;t like us.&#x201d;<p></p> <br>It is the middle of winter in northern Alberta, Canada. The temperature is well below zero, one of those days that is so cold your nose hairs feel like little sticks plugging up your nostrils and every exhalation of breath becomes its own fogbank. I was born not too far from this city, up in the northern prairies.<br> <br>&#x201c;At least it&#x2019;s a dry cold,&#x201d; someone offers, which is true, but not that comforting.<br> <br>We enter the building and I unwrap the layers of protection, trading them for the warmth of this place of incarceration. We are visiting a women&#x2019;s prison. The women who have asked me to come and speak said that dozens of copies of The Shack have been making the rounds and having an impact. The government has given these inmates a &#x201c;time-out,&#x201d; an invitation to think about their lives and choices, something that people outside these walls have little opportunity to do. These women are here today to spend an hour with me, by their own choosing. Their presence is a gift.<br> <br>Those who have eyes to see will find much wonder beneath tough exteriors and callous hearts. Most of the women are here because of a relationship gone wrong, and their suffered betrayals and losses are visible in their bluster of defiance or barely concealed shame. I feel quite at home here, among the bruised and wounded. These are my people, our people.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t remember what I talked about. It probably had to do with the prisons in my own life, places that became precious to me because they were all I knew. About how we hold on to the certainty of our pain rather than take the risk of trusting anyone ever again. Deeply wounded souls in the room began to weep. Bruce Cockburn, the Canadian poet and musician, would call these &#x201c;rumours of glory.&#x201d; Lost coins, lost sheep, lost sons, but not just any. These are my sons, my sheep, and my coins.<br> <br>I finish my talk and only a few leave. Others wait to have me sign a book. I hug everyone, which I am certain is a violation of all sorts of rules. But I have been breaking such codes for a while, and no one ever interferes with these sacred encounters. A woman stands waiting, her body tense with emotion. When I simply take her in my arms, it is as if I set off a charge that lets the dam burst. She sobs uncontrollably, for minutes. I whisper that it is okay, that I have other shirts, that I have her and she is safe. I can&#x2019;t comprehend all the misery and humanity that is flooding through this one small touch, but it is real and visceral and wrenching.<br> <br>Finally, she stops the heaving enough to find some words.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you really think,&#x201d; she whispers in short bursts, &#x201c;that Papa is fond of me?&#x201d;<br> <br>And there it is, the question. This tender human being is entrusting me with this monumental question. Even those who don&#x2019;t believe that God exists are desperate to know that love does and that love knows who we are. More, we are driven from within to take the risk to ask of someone or Someone, Do you find anything in me that is lovable, that is enough, that is worthy of being loved?<br> <br>There is a scene in The Shack in which the main character, Mackenzie, is having his assumptions challenged. Mack is face-to-face with Sophia, the Wisdom of God, and she is asking him about the love he has for his children. In particular, she asks which of his five children he loves the most.<br> <br>Even moderately healthy parents would tell you this question is impossible to answer. My wife, Kim, and I have six children. When our eldest was born, we couldn&#x2019;t imagine ever having the capacity to love another child. Our first used it all up. But then our second arrived, and suddenly there was a new depth of love that either hadn&#x2019;t existed or had been dormant before his arrival. It is as if each child brings with him or her a gift of love that is deposited into the hearts of the parents.<br> <br>In the religious subculture in which I was raised, we all knew that God is love. We said it and sang it all the time, until it didn&#x2019;t mean that much. It was simply the way that God is. It is like the grandchild who says, &#x201c;But you have to love me. You&#x2019;re my gramps.&#x201d;<br> <br>But saying &#x201c;God is love&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t capture our question, does it? So I&#x2019;ve made a habit of rephrasing the line &#x201c;God loves you,&#x201d; and instead of making it about God, I make it about the object of God&#x2019;s relentless affection&#x2014;us. So throughout The Shack, Papa would say, &#x201c;I am especially fond of her or him.&#x201d; There is a world of difference between saying &#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; which is about me, and saying &#x201c;I am especially fond of you,&#x201d; which is about you. Both are correct, but the latter somehow pierces the disquiet of our souls and says, &#x201c;Yes, I know you love me, but do you know me and do you like me? You love because that is the way you are, but is there anything about me that is worth loving? Do you &#x2018;see&#x2019; me, and do you like what you &#x2018;see&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you really think,&#x201d; she whispers in short bursts, &#x201c;that Papa is fond of me?&#x201d;<br> <br>I squeeze her tight. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I whisper back as we both dissolve into torrents of tears. &#x201c;Papa is especially fond of you!&#x201d;<br> <br>Minutes later she regains a semblance of emotional control and looks up into my face for the first time.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I needed to know. That&#x2019;s all I needed to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>With another hug, she exits, leaving me thinking, Darlin&#x2019;, that is all any of us needs to know!</p><h2>The Black-Eyed Blonde: A Philip Marlowe Novel (Philip Marlowe Series)</h2><p><p><b>Raymond Chandler's incomparable private eye is back, pulled by a seductive young heiress into the most difficult and dangerous case of his career</b></p><p>"It was one of those summer Tuesday afternoons when you begin to wonder if the earth has stopped revolving. The telephone on my desk had the look of something that knows it's being watched. Traffic trickled by in the street below, and there were a few pedestrians, too, men in hats going nowhere."</p><p>So begins <i>The Black-Eyed Blonde</i>, a new novel featuring Philip Marlowe&#x2015;yes, that Philip Marlowe. Channeling Raymond Chandler, Benjamin Black has brought Marlowe back to life for a new adventure on the mean streets of Bay City, California. It is the early 1950s, Marlowe is as restless and lonely as ever, and business is a little slow. Then a new client is shown in: young, beautiful, and expensively dressed, she wants Marlowe to find her former lover, a man named Nico Peterson. Marlowe sets off on his search, but almost immediately discovers that Peterson's disappearance is merely the first in a series of bewildering events. Soon he is tangling with one of Bay City's richest families and developing a singular appreciation for how far they will go to protect their fortune.</p><p>Only Benjamin Black, a modern master of the genre, could write a new Philip Marlowe detective novel that has all the panache and charm of the originals while delivering a story that is as sharp and fresh as today's best crime fiction.</p></p><p><b>Benjamin Black</b> is the pen name of the Man Booker Prize-winning novelist John Banville. The author of the bestselling and critically acclaimed series of Quirke novels&#x2015;including <i>Christine Falls</i>, <i>Vengeance</i>, and <i>Holy Orders</i>&#x2015;he lives in Dublin.1 <p>It was one of those Tuesday afternoons in summer when you wonder if the earth has stopped revolving. The telephone on my desk had the air of something that knows it&#x2019;s being watched. Cars trickled past in the street below the dusty window of my office, and a few of the good folks of our fair city ambled along the sidewalk, men in hats, mostly, going nowhere. I watched a woman at the corner of Cahuenga and Hollywood, waiting for the light to change. Long legs, a slim cream jacket with high shoulders, navy blue pencil skirt. She wore a hat, too, a skimpy affair that made it seem as if a small bird had alighted on the side of her hair and settled there happily. She looked left and right and left again&#x2014;she must have been so good when she was a little girl&#x2014;then crossed the sunlit street, treading gracefully on her own shadow.</p> <p>So far it had been a lean season. I had done a week playing bodyguard to a guy who had flown in from New York on the clipper. He had a blue jaw and wore a gold wristband and a pinkie ring with a ruby in it as big as a boysenberry. He said he was a businessman and I decided to believe him. He was worried, and sweated a lot, but nothing happened and I got paid. Then Bernie Ohls in the Sheriff&#x2019;s office put me in touch with a nice little old lady whose hophead son had pinched her late husband&#x2019;s rare coin collection. I had to apply a little muscle to get the goods back, but nothing serious. There was a coin in there with the head of Alexander the Great on it, and another one showing Cleopatra in profile, with that big nose of hers&#x2014;what did they all see in her?</p> <p>The buzzer sounded to announce that the outer door had opened, and I heard a woman walk across the waiting room and pause a moment at the door of my office. The sound of high heels on a wooden floor always gets something going in me. I was about to call to her to come in, using my special deep-toned, you-can-trust-me-I&#x2019;m-a-detective voice, when she came in anyway, without knocking.</p> <p>She was taller than she had seemed when I saw her from the window, tall and slender with broad shoulders and trim hips. My type, in other words. The hat she wore had a veil, a dainty visor of spotted black silk that stopped at the tip of her nose&#x2014;and a nice tip it was, to a very nice nose, aristocratic but not too narrow or too long, and nothing at all like Cleopatra&#x2019;s jumbo schnozzle. She wore elbow-length gloves, pale cream to match her jacket, and fashioned from the hide of some rare creature that had spent its brief life bounding delicately over Alpine crags. She had a good smile, friendly, so far as it went, and a little lopsided in an attractively sardonic way. Her hair was blond and her eyes were black, black and deep as a mountain lake, the lids exquisitely tapered at their outer corners. A blonde with black eyes&#x2014;that&#x2019;s not a combination you get very often. I tried not to look at her legs. Obviously the god of Tuesday afternoons had decided I deserved a little lift.</p> <p>&#x201c;The name is Cavendish,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>I invited her to sit down. If I&#x2019;d known it was me she was coming to call on, I would have brushed my hair and applied a dab of bay rum behind my earlobes. But she had to take me as I was. She didn&#x2019;t seem to disapprove too much of what she was seeing. She sat down in front of my desk on the chair I had pointed her to and took off her gloves finger by finger, studying me with her steady black eyes.</p> <p>&#x201c;What can I do for you, Miss Cavendish?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Mrs.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Sorry&#x2014;Mrs. Cavendish.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A friend told me about you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, yes? Good things, I hope.&#x201d;</p> <p>I offered her one of the Camels I keep in a box on my desk for clients, but she opened her patent leather purse and took out a silver case and flipped it open with her thumb. Sobranie Black Russian&#x2014;what else? When I struck a match and offered it across the desk she leaned forward and bent her head, with dipped lashes, and touched a fingertip briefly to the back of my hand. I admired her pearl-pink nail polish, but didn&#x2019;t say so. She sat back in the chair and crossed her legs under the narrow blue skirt and gave me that coolly appraising look again. She was taking her time in deciding what she should make of me.</p> <p>&#x201c;I want you to find someone,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Right. Who would that be?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A man named Peterson&#x2014;Nico Peterson.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Friend of yours?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He used to be my lover.&#x201d;</p> <p>If she expected me to swallow my teeth in shock, she was disappointed. &#x201c;Used to be?&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes. He disappeared, rather mysteriously, without even saying goodbye.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;When was this?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Two months ago.&#x201d;</p> <p>Why had she waited so long before coming to me? I decided not to ask her, or not yet, anyway. It gave me a funny feeling, being looked at by those cool eyes behind the veil&#x2019;s transparent black mesh. It was like being watched through a secret window; watched, and measured.</p> <p>&#x201c;You say he disappeared,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You mean out of your life, or altogether?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Both, it seems.&#x201d;</p> <p>I waited for more, but she only leaned back a farther inch or so and smiled again. That smile: it was like something she had set a match to a long time ago and then left to smolder on by itself. She had a lovely upper lip, prominent, like a baby&#x2019;s, soft-looking and a little swollen, as if she had done a lot of kissing recently, and not kissing babies, either. She must have sensed my unease about the veil, and put up a hand now and lifted it away from her face. Without it, the eyes were even more striking, a lustrous shade of seal-black that made something catch in my throat.</p> <p>&#x201c;So tell me about him,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;your Mr. Peterson.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Tallish, like you. Dark. Handsome, in a weak sort of way. Wears a silly mustache, Don Ameche&#x2013;style. Dresses nicely, or used to, when I had a say in the matter.&#x201d;</p> <p>She had taken a short ebony holder from her purse and was fitting the Black Russian into it. Deft, those fingers; slender, but with strength in them.</p> <p>&#x201c;What does he do?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>She glanced at me with a steely twinkle. &#x201c;For a living, you mean?&#x201d; She pondered the question. &#x201c;He sees people,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>This time I leaned back in my chair. &#x201c;How do you mean?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Just what I say. Practically every time I saw him, he was about to leave urgently. <i>I gotta see this guy. There&#x2019;s this guy I gotta go see.</i>&#x201d; She was a good mimic; I was beginning to get a picture of Mr. Peterson. <i>He</i> didn&#x2019;t sound like <i>her</i> type.</p> <p>&#x201c;A busy fellow, then,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&#x201c;His busyness had few results, I&#x2019;m afraid. At any rate, not results that you&#x2019;d notice, or that I noticed, anyway. If you ask him, he&#x2019;ll tell you he&#x2019;s an agent to the stars. The people he had to see so urgently were usually connected to one of the studios.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was interesting, the way she kept switching tenses. All the same, I had the impression that he was very much the past, for her, this Peterson bird. So why did she want him found?</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in the movie business?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t say <i>in</i>. Sort of scrabbling at the edges with his fingertips. He had some success with Mandy Rogers.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Should I know the name?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Starlet&#x2014;ing�nue, Nico would say. Think Jean Harlow without the talent.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Jean Harlow had talent?&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled at that. &#x201c;Nico is firmly of the belief that all his geese are swans.&#x201d;</p> <p>I got out my pipe and filled it. It struck me that the tobacco blend I was using had some Cavendish in it. I decided not to share this happy coincidence with her, imagining the jaded smile and the twitch of disdain at the corner of her mouth that would greet it.</p> <p>&#x201c;Known him long, your Mr. Peterson?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not long.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How long would not long be?&#x201d;</p> <p>She shrugged, which involved a fractional lift of her right shoulder. &#x201c;A year?&#x201d; She made it a question. &#x201c;Let me see. It was summer when we met. August, maybe.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Where was that? That you met, I mean.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The Cahuilla Club. Do you know it? It&#x2019;s in the Palisades. Polo grounds, swimming pools, lots of bright, shiny people. The kind of place that wouldn&#x2019;t let a shamus like you put his foot inside the electronically controlled gates.&#x201d; That last bit she didn&#x2019;t say, but I heard it all the same.</p> <p>&#x201c;Your husband know about him? About you and Peterson?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I really can&#x2019;t say.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t, or won&#x2019;t?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; She glanced down at the cream gloves where she had draped them across her lap. &#x201c;Mr. Cavendish and I have&#x2014;what shall I say? An arrangement.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Which is?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re being disingenuous, Mr. Marlowe. I&#x2019;m sure you know very well the kind of arrangement I mean. My husband likes polo ponies and cocktail waitresses, not necessarily in that order.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;And you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I like many things. Music, mainly. Mr. Cavendish has two reactions to music, depending on mood and state of sobriety. Either it makes him sick or it makes him laugh. He does not have a melodious laugh.&#x201d;</p> <p>I got up from the desk and took my pipe to the window and stood looking out at nothing in particular. In an office across the street, a secretary in a tartan blouse and wearing earphones from a Dictaphone machine was bent over her typewriter, tapping away. I had passed her in the street a few times. Nice little face, shy smile; the kind of girl who lives with her mother and cooks meat loaf for Sunday lunch. This is a lonely town.</p> <p>&#x201c;When&#x2019;s the last time you saw Mr. Peterson?&#x201d; I asked, still watching Miss Remington at her work. There was silence behind me, and I turned. Obviously, Mrs. Cavendish was not prepared to address herself to anyone&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I stand at this window a lot, contemplating the world and its ways.&#x201d;</p> <p>I came back and sat down again. I put my pipe in the ashtray and clasped my hands together and propped my chin on a couple of knuckles to show her how attentive I could be. She decided to accept this earnest demonstration of my full and unwavering concentration. She said, &#x201c;I told you when I saw him last&#x2014;about a month ago.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Where was that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;At the Cahuilla, as it happens. A Sunday afternoon. My husband was engaged in a particularly strenuous chukker. That&#x2019;s a&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A round in polo. Yes, I know.&#x201d;</p> <p>She leaned forward and dropped a few flakes of cigarette ash beside the bowl of my pipe. A faint waft of her perfume came across the desk. It smelled like Chanel No. 5, but then, to me all perfumes smell like Chanel No. 5, or did up to then.</p> <p>&#x201c;Did Mr. Peterson give any indication that he was about to decamp?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Decamp? That&#x2019;s an odd word to use.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It seemed less dramatic than <i>disappeared,</i> which was your word.&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled and gave a dry little nod, conceding the point. &#x201c;He was much as usual,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A little bit more distracted, perhaps, a little nervous, even&#x2014;though maybe it only seems that way in hindsight.&#x201d; I liked the way she talked; it made me think of the ivy-covered walls of venerable colleges, and trust fund details written out on parchment in a copperplate hand. &#x201c;He certainly didn&#x2019;t give any strong indication that he was about to&#x201d;&#x2014;she smiled again&#x2014;&#x201c;decamp.&#x201d;</p> <p>I thought for a bit, and let her see me thinking. &#x201c;Tell me,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;when did you realize he was gone? I mean, when did you decide he had&#x201d;&#x2014;now it was my turn to smile&#x2014;&#x201c;disappeared?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I telephoned him a number of times and got no answer. Then I called at his house. The milk hadn&#x2019;t been canceled and the newspapers had been piling up on his porch. It wasn&#x2019;t like him to leave things like that. He was careful, in some ways.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Did you go to the police?&#x201d;</p> <p>Her eyes widened. &#x201c;The police?&#x201d; she said, and I thought she might laugh. &#x201c;That wouldn&#x2019;t have done at all. Nico was rather shy of the police, and he would not have thanked me for putting them onto him.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Shy in what way?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Did he have things to hide?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Haven&#x2019;t we all, Mr. Marlowe?&#x201d; Again she dilated those lovely lids.</p> <p>&#x201c;Depends.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;On what?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;On many things.&#x201d;</p> <p>This was going nowhere, in ever-increasing circles. &#x201c;Let me ask you, Mrs. Cavendish,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;what do <i>you</i> think has become of Mr. Peterson?&#x201d;</p> <p>Once more she did her infinitesimal shrug. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to think. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve come to you.&#x201d;</p> <p>I nodded&#x2014;sagely, I hoped&#x2014;then took up my pipe and did some business with it, tamping the dottle, and so on. A tobacco pipe is a very handy prop, when you want to seem thoughtful and wise. &#x201c;May I ask,&#x201d; I asked, &#x201c;why you waited so long before coming to&nbsp;me?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Was it a long time? I kept thinking I&#x2019;d hear from him, that the phone would ring one day and he&#x2019;d be calling from Mexico or somewhere.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Why would he be in Mexico?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;France, then, the C�te d&#x2019;Azur. Or somewhere more exotic&#x2014;Moscow, maybe, Shanghai, I don&#x2019;t know. Nico liked to travel. It fed his restlessness.&#x201d; She sat forward a little, showing the faintest trace of impatience. &#x201c;Will you take the case, Mr. Marlowe?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do what I can,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;But let&#x2019;s not call it a case, not just&nbsp;yet.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What are your terms?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;The usual.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t say I know what the usual is likely to be.&#x201d;</p> <p>I hadn&#x2019;t really thought she would. &#x201c;A hundred dollars deposit and twenty-five a day plus expenses while I&#x2019;m making my inquiries.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How long will they take, your inquiries?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That too depends.&#x201d;</p> <p>She was silent for a moment, and again her eyes took on that appraising look, making me squirm a little. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t asked me anything about myself,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>&#x201c;I was working my way around to it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, let me save you some work. My maiden name is Langrishe. Have you heard of Langrishe Fragrances, Inc.?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;The perfume company.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Dorothea Langrishe is my mother. She was a widow when she came over from Ireland, bringing me with her, and founded the business here in Los Angeles. If you&#x2019;ve heard of her, then you know how successful she has been. I work for her&#x2014;or with her, as she&#x2019;d prefer to say. The result is that I&#x2019;m quite rich. I want you to find Nico Peterson for me. He&#x2019;s a poor thing but mine own. I&#x2019;ll pay you whatever you ask.&#x201d;</p> <p>I considered poking at my pipe again but thought it would seem a little obvious the second time around. Instead I gave her a level look, making my eyes go blank. &#x201c;As I said, Mrs. Cavendish&#x2014;a hundred down and twenty-five a day, plus expenses. The way I work, every case is a special case.&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled, pursing her lips. &#x201c;I thought you weren&#x2019;t going to call it a case, as yet.&#x201d;</p> <p>I decided to let her have that one. I pulled open a drawer and brought out a standard contract and pushed it across the desk to her with the tip of one finger. &#x201c;Take that with you, read it, and if you agree with the terms, sign it and get it back to me. In the meantime, give me Mr. Peterson&#x2019;s address and phone number. Also anything else you think might be useful to me.&#x201d;</p> <p>She gazed at the contract for a moment, as if she were deciding whether to take it or throw it in my face. In the end she picked it up, folded it carefully, and put it in her purse. &#x201c;He has a place in West Hollywood, off Bay City Boulevard,&#x201d; she said. She opened her purse again and took out a small leather-bound notebook and a slim gold pencil. She wrote in the notebook briefly, then tore out the page and handed it to me. &#x201c;Napier Street,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Keep a sharp eye out or you&#x2019;ll miss it. Nico prefers secluded spots.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;On account of being so shy,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>She stood up, while I stayed sitting. I smelled her perfume again. Not Chanel, then, but Langrishe, the name or number of which I would dedicate myself to finding out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need a contact for you, too,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>She pointed to the piece of paper in my hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve put my telephone number on there....</p></p><h2>The Doors of Perception: Heaven and Hell (Thinking Classics)</h2><p>In 1952 Aldous Huxley became involved in the now legendary experiment to clinically detail the physiological and psycho-logical effects of the little known drug used by Mexican and Native American elders in religious practices. The drug was Peyote-now commonly know as mescalin. By the standards of the time, Huxley was a hard working, respected, and reserved intellectual from a highly intelligent, well-know, and eccentric British family. By any standards, the results of the experiment were remarkable. The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell detail the practic-alities of the experiment and give Huxley&#39;s vivid account of his im-mediate experience and the more prolonged effect upon his sub-sequent thinking and awareness. At first, the reader is drawn in by the sheer naivety and tom-foolery of the proposal but is soon caught in a finely woven net by the juxtaposition of Huxley&#39;s formidable intellect, his remarkable ability to convey the experience in such acute and truthful detail, and his incredible modesty. In 1922 Gertrude Stein famously wrote - A rose is a rose is a rose. In proving her right, Huxley also shows the deeper meaning be-hind the apparently simple verse and goes on to deliver such spec-tacular accounts of the most everyday objects that the reason for their repeated and continual renderings by all the major artists throughout history suddenly becomes quite clear. For the con-scious and willing reader - a trip to the Guggenheim, the Louvre or the Tate Modern will never be the same again.</p><p>Sometimes a writer has to revisit the classics, and here we find that &#34;gonzo journalism&#34;--gutsy first-person accounts wherein the author is part of the story--didn&#39;t originate with Hunter S. Thompson or Tom Wolfe. Aldous Huxley took some mescaline and wrote about it some 10 or 12 years earlier than those others. The book he came up with is part bemused essay and part mystical treatise--&#34;suchness&#34; is everywhere to be found while under the influence. This is a good example of essay writing, journal keeping, and the value of controversy--always--in one&#39;s work.In 1953, Aldous Huxley took four-tenths of a gram of the drug Mescalin, sat down and waited to see what would happen. When he opened his eyes everything was transformed. He describes his experience in The Doors of Perception and its sequel Heaven and Hell.</p><h2>For those who hurt</h2><p>Who knows the heartache of having a home split apart?

CABINET</b><p>Inchmale hailed a cab for her, the kind that had always been black, when she'd first known this city.</p><p>Pearlescent silver, this one. Glyphed in Prussian blue, advertising something German, banking services or business software; a smoother simulacrum of its black ancestors, its faux-leather upholstery a shade of orthopedic fawn.</p><p>"Their money's heavy," he said, dropping a loose warm mass of pound coins into her hand. "Buys many whores." The coins still retained the body heat of the fruit machine from which he'd deftly wrung them, almost in passing, on their way out of the King's Something.</p><p>"Whose money?"</p><p>"My countrymen's. Freely given."</p><p>"I don't need this." Trying to hand it back.</p><p>"For the cab." Giving the driver the address in Portman Square.</p><p>"Oh Reg," she said, "it wasn't that bad. I had it in money markets, most of it."</p><p>"Bad as anything else. Call him."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Call him," he repeated, wrapped in Japanese herringbone Gore-Tex, multiply flapped and counter-intuitively buckled.</p><p>He closed the cab's door.</p><p>She watched him through the rear window as the cab pulled away. Stout and bearded, he turned now in Greek Street, a few minutes past midnight, to rejoin his stubborn prot�g�, Clammy of the Bollards. Back to the studio, to take up their lucrative creative struggle.</p><p>She sat back, noticing nothing at all until they passed Selfridges, the driver taking a right.</p><p>The club, only a few years old, was on the north side of Portman Square. Getting out, she paid and generously tipped the driver, anxious to be rid of Inchmale's winnings.</p><p>Cabinet, so called; of Curiosities, unspoken. Inchmale had become a member shortly after they, the three surviving members of the Curfew, had licensed the rights to "Hard to Be One" to a Chinese automobile manufacturer. Having already produced one Bollards album in Los Angeles, and with Clammy wanting to record the next in London, Inchmale had argued that joining Cabinet would ultimately prove cheaper than a hotel. And it had, she supposed, but only if you were talking about a very expensive hotel.</p><p>She was staying there now as a paying guest. Given the state of money markets, whatever those were, and the conversations she'd been having with her accountant in New York, she knew that she should be looking for more modestly priced accommodations.</p><p>A peculiarly narrow place, however expensive, Cabinet occupied half the vertical mass of an eighteenth-century townhouse, one whose fa�ade reminded her of the face of someone starting to fall asleep on the subway. It shared a richly but soberly paneled foyer with whatever occupied the other, westernmost, half of the building, and she'd formed a vague conviction that this must be a foundation of some kind, perhaps philanthropic in nature, or dedicated to the advancement of peace in the Middle East, however eventual. Something hushed, in any case, as it appeared to have no visitors at all.</p><p>There was nothing, on fa�ade or door, to indicate what that might be, no more than there was anything to indicate that Cabinet was Cabinet.</p><p>She'd seen those famously identical, silver-pelted Icelandic twins in the lounge, the first time she'd gone there, both of them drinking red wine from pint glasses, something Inchmale dubbed an Irish affectation. They weren't members, he'd made a point of noting. Cabinet's members, in the performing arts, were somewhat less than stellar, and she assumed that that suited Inchmale just about as well as it suited her.</p><p>It was the decor that had sold Inchmale, he said, and very likely it had been. Both he and it were arguably mad.</p><p>Pushing open the door, through which one might have ridden a horse without having to duck to clear the lintel, she was greeted by Robert, a large and comfortingly chalk-striped young man whose primary task was to mind the entrance without particularly seeming to.</p><p>"Good evening, Miss Henry."</p><p>"Good evening, Robert."</p><p>The decorators had kept it down, here, which was to say that they hadn't really gone publicly, ragingly, batshit insane. There was a huge, ornately carved desk, with something vaguely pornographic going on amid mahogany vines and grape clusters, at which sat one or another of the club's employees, young men for the most part, often wearing tortoiseshell spectacles of the sort she suspected of having been carved from actual turtles.</p><p>Beyond the desk's agreeably archaic mulch of paperwork twined a symmetrically opposed pair of marble stairways, leading to the floor above; that floor being bisected, as was everything above this foyer, into twin realms of presumed philanthropic mystery and Cabinet. From the Cabinet side, now, down the stairs with the wider-shins twist, cascaded the sound of earnest communal drinking, laughter and loud conversation bouncing sharply off unevenly translucent stone, marbled in shades of aged honey, petroleum jelly, and nicotine. The damaged edges of individual steps had been repaired with tidy rectangular inserts of less inspired stuff, pallid and mundane, which she was careful never to step on.</p><p>A tortoise-framed young man, seated at the desk, passed her the room key without being asked.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"You're welcome, Miss Henry."</p><p>Beyond the archway separating the stairways, the floor plan gave evidence of hesitation. Indicating, she guessed, some awkwardness inherent in the halving of the building's original purpose. She pressed a worn but regularly polished brass button, to call down the oldest elevator she'd ever seen, even in London. The size of a small, shallow closet, wider than it was deep, it took its time, descending its elongated cage of black-enameled steel.</p><p>To her right, in shadow, illuminated from within by an Edwardian museum fixture, stood a vitrine displaying taxidermy. Game birds, mostly; a pheasant, several quail, others she couldn't put a name to, all mounted as though caught in motion, crossing a sward of faded billiard-felt. All somewhat the worse for wear, though no more than might be expected for their probable age. Behind them, anthropomorphically upright, forelimbs outstretched in the manner of a cartoon somnambulist, came a moth-eaten ferret. Its teeth, which struck her as unrealistically large, she suspected of being wooden, and painted. Certainly its lips were painted, if not actually rouged, lending it a sinisterly festive air, like someone you'd dread running into at a Christmas party. Inchmale, on first pointing it out to her, had suggested she adopt it as a totem, her spirit beast. He claimed that he already had, subsequently discovering he could magically herniate the disks of unsuspecting music executives at will, causing them to suffer excruciating pain and a profound sense of helplessness.</p><p>The lift arrived. She'd been a guest here long enough to have mastered the intricacies of the articulated steel gate. Resisting an urge to nod to the ferret, she entered and ascended, slowly, to the third floor.</p><p>Here the narrow hallways, walls painted a very dark green, twisted confusingly. The route to her room involved opening several of what she assumed were fire doors, as they were very thick, heavy, and self-closing. The short sections of corridor, between, were hung with small watercolors, landscapes, un-peopled, each one featuring a distant folly. The very <i>same</i> distant folly, she'd noticed, regardless of the scene or region depicted. She refused to give Inchmale the satisfaction he'd derive from her asking about these, so hadn't. Something too thoroughly liminal about them. Best not addressed. Life sufficiently complicated as it was.</p><p>The key, attached to a weighty brass ferrule sprouting thick soft tassels of braided maroon silk, turned smoothly in the lock's brick-sized mass. Admitting her to Number Four, and the concentrated impact of Cabinet's designers' peculiarity, theatrically revealed when she prodded the mother-of-pearl dot set into an otherwise homely gutta-percha button.</p><p>Too tall, somehow, though she imagined that to be the result of a larger room having been divided, however cunningly. The bathroom, she suspected, might actually be larger than the bedroom, if that weren't some illusion.</p><p>They'd run with that tallness, employing a white, custom-printed wallpaper, decorated with ornate cartouches in glossy black. These were comprised, if you looked more closely, of enlarged bits of anatomical drawings of bugs. Scimitar mandibles, spiky elongated limbs, the delicate wings (she imagined) of mayflies. The two largest pieces of furniture in the room were the bed, its massive frame covered entirely in slabs of scrimshawed walrus ivory, with the enormous, staunchly ecclesiastic-looking lower jawbone of a right whale, fastened to the wall at its head, and a birdcage, so large she might have crouched in it herself, suspended from the ceiling. The cage was stacked with books, and fitted, inside, with minimalist Swiss halogen fixtures, each tiny bulb focused on one or another of Number Four's resident artifacts. And not just prop books, Inchmale had proudly pointed out. Fiction or non-, they all seemed to be about England, and so far she'd read parts of Dame Edith Sitwell's <i>English Eccentrics</i> and most of Geoffrey Household's <i>Rogue Male</i>.</p><p>She took off her coat, putting it on a stuffed, satin-covered hanger in the wardrobe, and sat on the edge of the bed to untie her shoes. The Piblokto Madness bed, Inchmale called it. "Intense hysteria," she recited now, from memory, "depression, coprophagia, insensitivity to cold, echolalia." She kicked her shoes in the direction of the wardrobe's open door. "Hold the coprophagia," she added. Cabin fever, this culture-bound, arctic condition. Possibly dietary in origin. Linked to vitamin A toxicity. Inchmale was full of this sort of information, never more so than when he was in the studio. Give Clammy a whole hod of vitamin A, she'd suggested, he looks like he could use it.</p><p>Her gaze fell on three unopened brown cartons, stacked to the left of the wardrobe. These contained shrink-wrapped copies of the British edition of a book she'd written in hotel rooms, though none as peculiarly memorable as this one. She'd begun just after the Chinese car commercial money had come in. She'd gone to Staples, West Hollywood, and bought three flimsy Chinese-made folding tables, to lay the manuscript and its many illustrations out on, in her corner suite at the Marmont. That seemed a long time ago, and she didn't know what she'd do with these copies. The cartons of her copies of the American edition, she now remembered, were still in the luggage room of the Tribeca Grand.</p><p>"Echolalia," she said, and stood, removing her sweater, which she folded and put in a chest-high drawer in the wardrobe, beside a small silk land mine of potpourri. If she didn't touch it, she knew, she wouldn't have to smell it. Putting on an off-white Cabinet robe, more velour than terry but somehow just missing whatever it was that made her so un-fond of velour bathrobes. Men, particularly, looked fundamentally untrustworthy in them.</p><p>The room phone began to ring. It was a collage, its massive nautical-looking handset of rubber-coated bronze resting in a leather-padded cradle atop a cubical box of brass-cornered rosewood. Its ring was mechanical, tiny, as though you were hearing an old-fashioned bicycle bell far off down a quiet street. She stared hard, willing it to silence.</p><p>"Intense hysteria," she said.</p><p>It continued to ring.</p><p>Three steps and her hand was on it.</p><p>It was as absurdly heavy as ever.</p><p>"Coprophagia." Briskly, as if announcing a busy department in a large hospital.</p><p>"Hollis," he said, "hello."</p><p>She looked down at the handset, heavy as an old hammer and nearly as battered. Its thick cord, luxuriously cased in woven burgundy silk, resting against her bare forearm.</p><p>"Hollis?"</p><p>"Hello, Hubertus."</p><p>She pictured herself driving the handset through brittle antique rosewood, crushing the aged electro-mechanical cricket within. Too late now. It had already fallen silent.</p><p>"I saw Reg," he said.</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"I told him to ask you to call."</p><p>"I didn't," she said.</p><p>"Good to hear your voice," he said.</p><p>"It's late."</p><p>"A good night's sleep, then," heartily. "I'll be by in the morning, for breakfast. We're driving back tonight. Pamela and I."</p><p>"Where are you?"</p><p>"Manchester."</p><p>She saw herself taking an early cab to Paddington, the street in front of Cabinet deserted. Catching the Heathrow Express. Flying somewhere. Another phone ringing, in another room. His voice.</p><p>"Manchester?"</p><p>"Norwegian black metal," he said, flatly. She pictured Scandinavian folk jewelry, then self-corrected: the musical genre. "Reg said I might find it interesting."</p><p>Good for him, she thought, Inchmale's subclinical sadism sometimes finding a deserving target.</p><p>"I was planning on sleeping in," she said, if only to be difficult. She knew now that it was going to be impossible to avoid him.</p><p>"Eleven, then," he said. "Looking forward to it."</p><p>"Good night. Hubertus."</p><p>"Good night." He hung up.</p><p>She put the handset down. Careful of the hidden cricket. Not its fault.</p><p>Nor hers.</p><p>Nor even his, probably. Whatever he was.</p><p><br></p><p><b>2. EDGE CITY</b></p><p>Milgrim considered the dog-headed angels in Gay Dolphin Gift Cove.</p><p>Their heads, rendered slightly less than three-quarter scale, appeared to have been cast from the sort of plaster once used to produce worryingly detailed wall-decorations: pirates, Mexicans, turbaned Arabs. There would almost certainly be examples of those here as well, he thought, in the most thoroughgoing trove of roadside American souvenir kitsch he'd ever seen.</p><p>Their bodies, apparently humanoid under white satin and sequins, were long, Modigliani-slender, perilously upright, paws crossed piously in the manner of medieval effigies. Their wings were the wings of Christmas ornaments, writ larger than would suit the average tree.</p><p>They were intended, he decided, with half a dozen of assorted breed facing him now, from behind glass, to sentimentally honor deceased pets.</p><p>Hands in trouser pockets, he quickly swung his gaze to a broader but generally no less peculiar visual complexity, noting as he did a great many items featuring Confederate-flag motifs. Mugs, magnets, ashtrays, statuettes. He considered a knee-high jockey boy, proffering a small round tray rather than the traditional ring. Its head and hands were a startling Martian green (so as not to give the traditional offense, he assumed). There were also energetically artificial orchids, coconuts carved to suggest the features of some generically indigenous race, and prepackaged collections of rocks and minerals. It was like being on the bottom of a Coney Island grab-it game, one in which the eclectically un-grabbed had been accumulating for decades. He looked up, imagining a giant, three-pronged claw, agent of stark removal, but there was only a large and heavily varnished shark, suspended overhead like the fuselage of a small plane.</p><p>How old did a place like this have to be, in America, to have "gay" in its name? Some percentage of the stock here, he judged, had been manufactured in Occupi...</p></p><h2>Altered Books Workshop</h2><p><p><b>Give books new life filled with creative expression</b></p><p>Turn old books into personalized works of art with <i>Altered Books Workshop</i>.

Jonathan has been hard and cold since the death of his wife and daughter, but as Thomas watches him work, a miracle occurs to warm his sad, chill heart.</p><p>Susan Wojciechowski, born in New York, was a children&#39;s librarian and schoolteacher for many years before becoming a successful author. Susan is best known for her first picture book, The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey, which won numerous honours including the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal, and was adapted into a feature film. About her writing, Susan says, &#34;As a mother, librarian, and former teacher as well as a children&#39;s author, I have always felt the need to touch the minds of children. Through my writing, I try to reach children in a special way, by portraying them as real people - warts and all - and showing them that they are more or less alike, despite their differences.&#34;P.J. Lynch has won many awards including the Mother Goose Award, the Christopher Medal three times, the Irish Bisto Book of the Year Award, and the prestigious Kate Greenaway Medal on two occasions - first for The Christmas Miracle of Jonathan Toomey by Susan Wojciechowski, and again for When Jessie Came Across the Sea by Amy Hest. In recent years, P.J. Lynch has been commissioned to design posters for Opera Ireland and the Abbey Theatre, as well as designing stamps for An Post. He lives in Dublin with his wife and their three children.Ages 4^-9. "Christmas is pish-posh," grumbles Jonathan Toomey, the best wood carver in the valley. He's a Scroogelike recluse; but he's a gentle grouch, it turns out, and he hides a sad secret. He's transformed, not by Dickensian ghosts, but by an eager seven-year-old boy and his widowed mother who ask him to make them a Christmas creche. The story verges on the sentimental, but it's told with feeling and lyricism (he "traveled till his tears stopped" ). Lynch's sweeping illustrations, in shades of wood grain, are both realistic and gloriously romantic, focusing on faces and hands at work before the fire and in the lamplight. In a beautiful, elemental scene, the angry wood carver stands on the threshold of his home, disturbed by the gentle widow and her son who want his help and will transform his life. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>PAGES OF HISTORY VOLUME 1 Secrets of the Ancients</h2><p>Perfect for family story time or individual study, Pages of History transports the reader through the timeline of the world, providing a view of Gods work in every age.

With insight and humour, she presents down-to-earth guidance on how to make friends with ourselves and develop genuine compassion towards others. This book shows how we can &#39;start where we are&#39; by embracing rather than denying the painful aspects of our lives. Pema Chodron frames her teachings on compassion around fifty-nine traditional Tibetan Buddhist maxims, or slogans, such as: &#39;Always apply a joyful state of mind&#39;, &#39;Always meditate on whatever provokes resentment&#39; and &#39;Be grateful to everyone&#39;. Working with these slogans and through the practice of meditation, Start Where You Are shows how we can all develop the courage to work with our own inner pain and discover joy, well-being and confidence.</p><p>Pema Chodron is a Buddhist nun for regular folks. Having raised a family of her own, she doesn't shy away from persistent troubles and the basic meatiness of life. In fact, in <i>Start Where You Are</i>, Chodron tries to get us to see that the faults and foibles in each of us now are the perfect ingredients for creating a better life. No need to wait for a quieter time or a more settled mind. The trick Chodron says is to repattern ourselves, to transform bad habits into good by first opening ourselves to the groundlessness of existence. When the cliff dissolves beneath our feet, fear has a way of actually lessening. Fearlessness opens the way to recognizing our pushy egos and that rather than being cursed with original sin, we are blessed with an original soft spot--the squishy feeling inside that we all have, that is the seat of true compassion, and that we all do our best to armor over. Chodron is the kind of teacher who has seen it all and keeps pushing us back into ourselves until there's no one left to wrestle with but a certain recalcitrant image in the mirror. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Pema Choedroen is an American Buddhist nun and one of the foremost students of Chogyam Trungpa, the renowned Tibetan meditation master. She is the author of The Wisdom of No Escape, Start Where You Are, The Places that Scare You and the best-selling When Things Fall Apart. She is the resident teacher at Gampo Abbey, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, the first Tibetan monastery in North America established for Westerners.</p><h2>Would You Rather? (Red Fox Picture Books)</h2><p>Would You Rather</p><p>Given the choice, we think most kids would rather read John Burningham's books than taste slug dumplings, jump in nettles, or possibly even dance with a goat. However, in the delightfully silly <i>Would You Rather...</i>, readers are invited to play with these and many other ideas--absurd, gross, or tantalizing. A small mop-topped child lets his imagination run away with such personal challenges as, "Would you rather have supper in a castle, breakfast in a balloon, or tea on the river?" The oversized format is perfect for reading aloud, as long as the reader allows plenty of time for the audience to peruse the award-winning author-illustrator's humorous pictures (in one spread, the protagonist looks like he'd rather be anywhere but here as he is systematically crushed by a snake, swallowed by a fish, eaten by a crocodile, and sat on by a rhinoceros). For TV-weary children who have seen cartoon characters squashed and revived a thousand times, the nightmarish aspects of this reprinted 1978 charmer will not be overly alarming, but the faint of heart may want to look elsewhere for a soothing bedtime story... perhaps Burningham's own <i>Hushabye</i>?

Yet for decades their work has remained shrouded in secrecy. Now, in this riveting new history, W.

By the end of the year he was also the victim of a rare kind of stroke to the brainstem.&nbsp;&nbsp;After 20 days in a coma, Bauby awoke into a body which had all but stopped working: only his left eye functioned, allowing him to see and, by blinking it, to make clear that his mind was unimpaired. Almost miraculously, he was soon able to express himself in the richest detail: dictating a word at a time, blinking to select each letter as the alphabet was recited to him slowly, over and over again. In the same way, he was able eventually to compose this extraordinary book.<br><br>By turns wistful, mischievous, angry, and witty, Bauby bears witness to his determination to live as fully in his mind as he had been able to do in his body. He explains the joy, and deep sadness, of seeing his children and of hearing his aged father's voice on the phone. In magical sequences, he imagines traveling to other places and times and of lying next to the woman he loves. Fed only intravenously, he imagines preparing and tasting the full flavor of delectable dishes. Again and again he returns to an "inexhaustible reservoir of sensations," keeping in touch with himself and the life around him.<br><br>Jean-Dominique Bauby died two days after the French publication of <b>The Diving Bell and the Butterfly</b>. <br><br>This book is a lasting testament to his life.</p><p>We've all got our idiosyncrasies when it comes to writing--a special chair we have to sit in, a certain kind of yellow paper we absolutely must use. To create this tremendously affecting memoir, Jean-Dominique Bauby used the only tool available to him--his left eye--with which he blinked out its short chapters, letter by letter. Two years ago, Bauby, then the 43-year-old editor-in-chief of <i>Elle</i> France, suffered a rare stroke to the brain stem; only his left eye and brain escaped damage. Rather than accept his "locked in" situation as a kind of death, Bauby ignited a fire of the imagination under himself and lived his last days--he died two days after the French publication of this slim volume--spiritually unfettered. In these pages Bauby journeys to exotic places he has and has not been, serving himself delectable gourmet meals along the way (surprise: everything's ripe and nothing burns). In the simplest of terms he describes how it feels to see reflected in a window "the head of a man who seemed to have emerged from a vat of formaldehyde.""Was it Hemingway who defined grace under pressure? No matter who said it, the words have never been more pertinent than in speaking of this heroic book, dictated against the worst imaginable adversities. Although every word cost the author a superhuman effort, the prose is not sickbed telegraphese but rather as light as the sprightliest humor, as pungent as the taste of cooking apricots, as vigorous as the step of a young man setting out on a first date. Read this book and fall back in love with life."<br>-- <b>Edmund White</b><p>"To read this most extraordinary of narratives is to discover the luminosity within a courageous man's mind. Locked into his own world but not locked out of ours, [<b>]Jean-Dominique Bauby[</b>] explores images, memories and an entire landscape of fantasy and love. His incomparable final gift to us is a heartbreaking and yet glorious testament to the wrenching beauty of the human spirit."<br>-- <b>Sherwin B. Nuland, M.D.</b></p><p>"As riveting as a narrative from an explorer of deep space, this communication from a mind imprisoned in an unresponsive body is remarkable for its utter lack of self-pity or sentimentality.

Tour.</p><p>In 1979 Margaret Thatcher became the first woman British Prime Minister. A decade later she became the first premier for 160 years to win three consecutive general elections. In 1990 she resigned her leadership of an increasingly divided and turbulent government. She is the only PM to have given her name to a branch of political philosophy, and arguably the most important figure in postwar British politics.The Iron Lady tells all. Well, not exactly <i>all</i>; her memoirs reveal little of her personal life and, chronologically, cover only those years during which she was prime minister. Her book has already caused a stir in the U.K. and will be read with great enthusiasm on this side of the Atlantic not only by people involved in government, but also by general readers keen on foreign affairs. The first woman prime minister of Britain was never known for sugarcoating, and her remembrance of her 11-year tenure at No. 10 Downing Street is defined not only by its wealth of details about her activities as head of the government, but also by her unequivocal opinions about world-important events she participated in and history-changing individuals she encountered. Would we expect anything else but outspokenness from Thatcher as she reviews, analyzes, explains, and defends her policies and procedures, domestic and foreign, during her controversial presiding over Britain's disestablishment of socialism and resurgence as a world power? Highlights of her recollections include her comments on the Falklands War ("The significance . . . was enormous, both for Britain's self-confidence and for [its] standing in the world") and the reunification of Germany ("Germany is . . . by its very nature a destabilizing rather than a stabilizing force in Europe"). One has to admire her for her honesty, integrity, and stick-to-her-guns attitude. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>SOG: The Secret Wars of America&#39;s Commandos in Vietnam</h2><p>Plaster (The Ultimate Sniper), a retired Army major, served three tours with the secretive &#34;Studies and Observation Group,&#34; aka SOG, during the Vietnam War-a background he has put to good use in this authoritative and insightful look at the now defunct commando unit. Plaster does much to illuminate both this frequently misunderstood group and its extraordinary participants. Made up entirely of volunteers, SOG tackled a wide range of vital and dangerous duties, including missions deep into enemy territory and rescues of downed American pilots. Special Forces veterans in particular will delight in the descriptions of America&#39;s old tribal allies, the Montagnards of Vietnam. Specialists in poison-arrow warfare, the primitive &#34;&#39;Yards,&#34; Plaster explains, were both fierce fighters and a constant source of wonderment to the Americans. Plaster reveals the core of the relationship between &#39;Yards and Yanks in a telling anecdote in which two Green Berets win over a village chieftain with the help of some pipes and two cans of Prince Albert tobacco. Elsewhere, on a more somber note, Plaster sheds light on part of the ongoing mystery of POWs and MIAs in Southeast Asia. The secretive nature of SOG, he writes, was such that its members were accounted for via a &#34;double bookkeeping&#34; system. The method &#34;proved so confounding that the Pentagon had understated casualties, a fact that became evident when families of MIAs demanded more information.&#34; A true insider&#39;s account, this eye-opening report will leave readers feeling as if they&#39;ve been given a hot scoop on a highly classified project.</p><p><b>John L. Plaster</b> served three tours with SOG and was decorated for heroism four times. He is also the author of <i>The Ultimate Sniper</i>, and instructs military snipers and police SWAT officers in sharpshooting.For all the negative imagery attached to Americans who served in Vietnam, an unbiased and sober review of the historical accounts reveals an astonishing record of valor and sacrifice. Largely unknown outside of military circles, the Studies and Observation Group (SOG) was a U.S. Special Forces detachment formed to penetrate the Ho Chi Minh Trail and to rescue downed airmen. Plaster (Ultimate Sniper, Paladin, 1993), a veteran of three tours of duty with SOG, has written the most complete account of the missions to date. Together with their Montagnard and Nung allies, these small-raiding, observation, and rescue parties were inserted within enemy strongholds on uniformly perilous missions. Always outnumbered, SOG volunteers suffered catastrophic casualty rates. They also earned ten Congressional Medals of Honor. Written as a tribute to the memory of fallen comrades, Plaster's narrative is an engrossing and thoroughly exciting account of this unknown aspect of the Vietnam War. Highly recommended for academic and public libraries.? --John R. Vallely,<br><br>firstly, just buy this book and read it you will not be dissapointed. this book details many missions that the sog went on during the vietnam war, and one thing that gets you almost immediately was the sheer loss of life that these units experienced. the missions they went on were virtual suicide missions. they knew they would have contact with the enemy as soon as they had been inserted,they knew there was a mole in saigon relaying their mission details to hanoi, and they knew they would be persued constantly while they were in cambodia and laos, yet they still went on the missions. this book is gripping, if you can cope with the many deaths described in the book. excellent read, not glorified or gung ho at all. --By Antony A. Jones<br><br>Studies &amp; Observations Group. Seldom has a military unit's title so inadequately described what they actually did. Which was, of course, the point. I have read many books on the subject of Special Forces &amp; covert ops in Vietnam. This is, without doubt, the best. Still utterly compelling and inspiring, even now on the third read. What you have to keep reminding yourself, when reading this book, is that it is a true account of a secret war. So brave, heroic, selfless &amp; daring were the deeds carried out by the men of SOG, it is easy to forget that they were real events that happened to real people in real danger. It's a gripping account of the activities of men, who's job it was to play the most dangerous game of `cat &amp; mouse' imaginable. SOG men volunteered to go into hostile territory in small teams (typically 6 to 8 men), surrounded by thousands of enemy soldiers and bring back vital intelligence which was almost certainly responsible for saving many thousands of American lives. Sometime they did this completely undetected, all too often they had to run and fight for their lives to escape a vastly numerically superior foe intent on their destruction. John Plaster recounts many recon missions and the battle for survival SOG men faced each time they waged their silent war against the VC and NVA. You can almost feel the fear and adrenaline generated from such dangerous work. Almost. No book could ever truly give you a full understanding of how it felt to do what SOG did, but this book gets closer than any other I've read. At times this book also made me angry. All too often, deeds of heroism and bravery went unrecognized, due partly to the secret nature of what SOG did but sometimes due to the incompetence of the military. Although several SOG men received The Congressional Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War, it is clear many more should have. That said, the men of SOG didn't fight for medals or for some ideological hatred of communism. They fought and died for each other, their fellow soldiers, their "brothers". The greatest accolade for a SOG man wasn't a medal, (Purple Hearts were often not even requested) it was to be considered to be "good in the woods" by their peers. During The Vietnam War, SOG suffered a casualty rate of over 100% (every man wounded at least once). The unit had a kill ratio of 150:1 (150 enemy dead for each SOG operator killed). After reading this book you'll understand why they were so effective and you'll be amazed that their casualty rate wasn't higher. --By Dirk Hardcharger</p><h2>Nora Webster: A Novel</h2><p>From one of contemporary literature&#x2019;s bestselling, critically acclaimed and beloved authors, the magnificent, instant <i>New York Times </i>bestselling novel set in Ireland, about a fiercely compelling young widow and mother of four, navigating grief and fear, struggling for hope.<br><br>Set in Wexford, Ireland, Colm T�ib�n&#x2019;s superb seventh novel introduces the formidable, memorable and deeply moving Nora Webster. Widowed at forty, with four children and not enough money, Nora has lost the love of her life, Maurice, the man who rescued her from the stifling world to which she was born. And now she fears she may be drawn back into it. Wounded, strong-willed, clinging to secrecy in a tiny community where everyone knows your business, Nora is drowning in her own sorrow and blind to the suffering of her young sons, who have lost their father. Yet she has moments of stunning empathy and kindness, and when she begins to sing again, after decades, she finds solace, engagement, a haven&#x2014;herself.<br> <br><i>Nora Webster</i> is a masterpiece in character study by a writer at the zenith of his career, &#x201c;beautiful and daring&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>) and able to &#x201c;sneak up on readers and capture their imaginations&#x201d; (<i>USA TODAY</i>). In Nora Webster, T�ib�n has created a character as iconic, engaging and memorable as Madame Bovary or Hedda Gabler.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, October 2014:</strong> Atmospheric and emotional, Colm Toibin&#x2019;s (<i>Brooklyn</i>, <i>The Master</i>) seventh novel is the story of a forty-year-old widow in 1960s/70s rural Ireland who&#x2019;s on the verge of slipping back into the isolated life from which her husband had rescued her. Nora Webster is, like Toibin&#x2019;s best characters, iconoclastic, strong and deep. When she loses her beloved Maurice to a long and horrible illness, she seems beyond help: she resents the neighbors&#x2019; well-meaning questions and concerns and she&#x2019;s so grief stricken she barely notices how her children are suffering. Nora is not entirely likable&#x2014;a self-centered person mired in depression rarely is. But Nora is also proud, fierce and angry&#x2014;and slowly, slowly she wins you over. Even more important, she eventually finds a way to save herself. This is not a novel that makes a lot of noise&#x2014;and yet it&#x2019;s musical. It has a kind of deliberate, note-by-note crescendo&#x2014;but very few crashing cymbals&#x2014;as Nora rediscovers her love of singing, learns how art can help her navigate through grief, and how music can help even the most quiet among us to regain our voice. &#x2013; <i>Sara Nelson</i></p>Colm T�ib�n is the author of nine novels, including <i>The Blackwater Lightship</i>; <i>The Master</i>, winner of the Los Angeles Times Book Prize; <i>Brooklyn</i>, winner of the Costa Book Award; <i>The Testament of Mary</i>; and <i>Nora Webster</i>, as well as two story collections, and <i>Mad, Bad, Dangerous to Know</i>, a look at three nineteenth-century Irish authors.

It's the story of Michael O'Sullivan, a feared and religiously inclined mob hit man who's brutally betrayed-and the fierce vengeance he wreaks. It's 1930 and O'Sullivan works for the Looneys, an Irish mob family with a stranglehold on the politics and businesses of a small Midwestern city. Curious about his dad's mysterious "job," Michael Jr. stows away in his car to see what he does for a living. He inadvertently witnesses his father and one of the Looneys murder a crooked cop and his partners. Fearing what the kid saw, the Looneys set the O'Sullivans up to be killed. They murder O'Sullivan's wife and younger son, leaving him stunned but determined to have his revenge. The Looneys go into hiding, and O'Sullivan and son set out to find them, encountering the celebrities of gangland Chicago along the way. Collins writes a good gangster yarn based on historical personalities and full of crisp dialogue, violent action and brooding overtones of religious redemption. But O'Sullivan is essentially a superhero in a fedora, and his ability to kill an overwhelming number of adversaries with nary a scratch to show for it is a bit ridiculous. Though Rayner's b&amp;w drawings can be static, they are precisely rendered with strikingly delineated faces. Like movie posters, his drawings capture the action with a combination of slick draftsmanship and the bleak and shadowy forms of cinematic noir.

Accused of crimes against the state, he was banished from his beloved Athens, only to take up arms in the service of his former enemies.<br><br>For nearly three decades, Greece burned with war and Alcibiades helped bring victories to both sides &#x2014; and ended up trusted by neither.<br><br>Narrated from death row by Alcibiades&#x2019; bodyguard and assassin, a man whose own love and loathing for his former commander mirrors the mixed emotions felt by all Athens, <b>Tides of War</b> tells an epic saga of an extraordinary century, a war that changed history, and a complex leader who seduced a nation.</p><p>After chronicling the Spartan stand at Thermopylae in his audacious <i>Gates of Fire</i>, Steven Pressfield once again proves that it's all Greek to him. In <i>Tides of War</i>, he tells the tale of Athenian soldier extraordinaire Alcibiades. Despite the vaunted claims for Periclean democracy, he is undoubtedly first among equals--a great warrior and an impressive physical specimen to boot: "The beauty of his person easily won over those previously disposed, and disarmed even those who abhorred his character and conduct." He is also a formidable orator, whose stump speeches are paradoxically heightened by what some might consider an impediment: <blockquote> Even his lisp worked in Alcibiades' favor. It was a flaw; it made him human. It took the curse off his otherwise godlike self-presentation and made one, despite all misgivings, like the fellow. </blockquote> This tale of arms and the man requires two narrators. One, Jason, is an aging noble who serves as a sort of recording angel of the Athenian golden age. The other, Polymides, was long Alcibiades' right-hand man, yet is now imprisoned for his murder.<p> As they were in his previous novel, Pressfield's battle scenes are extraordinarily vivid and visceral. This time, however, many of these elemental clashes take place on water. "As far as sight could carry, the sea stood curtained with smoke and paved with warcraft. Immediately left, a battleship had rammed one of the vessels in the wall; all three of her banks were backing water furiously, to extract and ram again, while across the breach screamed storms of stones, darts, and brands of such density that the air appeared solid with steel and flame." </p><p> In addition to his gift for rendering patriotic gore, the author excels at quieter but no less deadly forms of combat. As Alcibiades' star rises and falls and rises again, we are escorted directly into the snakepit of Athenian realpolitik. Bathing us in the details of a distant era, Pressfield is largely convincing. But it must be said that his diction exhibits a sometimes comical variegation, sliding from Homeric rhetoric to tough-guy speak to the sort of casual Anglicisms we might expect from Evelyn Waugh's far-from-bright young things. No matter. <i>Tides of War</i> conquers by sheer storytelling prowess, reminding us that war was--and is--a highly addictive version of hell. <i>--Darya Silver</i></p>Praise for <b>Tides of War</b>:<br><br>"Pressfield's attention to historic detail is exquisite, but he shines brightest in his graphic and brutal descriptions of battle and its horrific affects on soldier and civilian alike.

Cannibalism was reported, though seldom convincingly documented, along with human sacrifice, bodily mutilation, body and face painting, and flagrantly open sexual practices. Equally jarring to European sensibilities was the almost ubiquitous practice of ecstatic ritual, in which the natives would gather to dance, sing, or chant to a state of exhaustion and, beyond that, sometimes trance. Everywhere they went--among the hunter-gatherers of Australia, the horticulturists of Polynesia, the village peoples of India--white men and occasionally women witnessed these electrifying rites so frequently that there seemed to them to be, among "the present societies of savage men&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;an extraordinary uniformity, in spite of much local variation, in ritual and mythology."1 The European idea of the "savage" came to focus on the image of painted and bizarrely costumed bodies, drumming and dancing with wild abandon by the light of a fire.<br>&nbsp;<br>What did they actually see? A single ritual could look very different to different observers. When he arrived in Tahiti in the late 1700s, Captain Cook watched groups of girls performing "a very indecent dance which they call Timorodee, singing the most indecent songs and using most indecent actions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;In doing this they keep time to a great nicety."2 About sixty years later, Herman Melville found the same ritual, by then called "Lory-Lory" and perhaps modified in other ways, full of sensual charm.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Presently, raising a strange chant, they softly sway themselves, gradually quickening the movement, until at length, for a few passionate moments with throbbing bosoms, and glowing cheeks, they abandon themselves to all the spirit of the dance, apparently lost to everything around. But soon subsiding again into the same languid measure as before, the eyes swimming in their heads, join in one wild chorus, and sink into each other's arms.3<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Like Captain Cook, Charles Darwin was repelled by the corroborree rite of western Australians, reporting that<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>the dancing consisted in their running either sideways or in Indian file into an open space, and stamping the ground with great force as they marched together. Their heavy footsteps were accompanied with a kind of grunt, by beating their clubs and spears together, and by various other gesticulations, such as extending their arms and wriggling their bodies. It was a most rude, barbarous scene, and, to our ideas, without any sort of meaning.4<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>But to the anthropologists Baldwin Spencer and Frank Gillen, a similar Aboriginal rite was far more compelling, perhaps even enticing: "The smoke, the blazing torches, the showers of sparks falling in all directions and the masses of dancing, yelling men formed a genuinely wild and savage scene of which it is impossible to convey any adequate idea in words."5 It was this description that fed into the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim's notion of collective effervescence: the ritually induced passion or ecstasy that cements social bonds and, he proposed, forms the ultimate basis of religion.<br>&nbsp;<br>Through the institution of slavery, European Americans had the opportunity to observe their own captive "natives" at close range, and they too reported varying and contradictory responses to the ecstatic rituals of the transplanted Africans. Many whites of the slave-owning class saw such practices as "noisy, crude, impious, and, simply, dissolute,"6 and took strong measures to suppress them. The nineteenth-century absentee owner of a Jamaican plantation found his slaves doing a myal dance, probably derived from an initiation rite of the Azande people of Africa, and described them as engaged in "a great variety of grotesque actions, and chanting all the while something between a song and a howl."7 Similarly, an English visitor to Trinidad in 1845 reported disgustedly that<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>on Christmas Eve, it seemed as if, under the guise of religion, all Pandemonium had been let loose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Drunkenness bursting forth in yells and bacchanalian orgies, was universal amongst the blacks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Sleep was out of the question, in the midst of such a disgusting and fiendish saturnalia&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The musicians were attended by a multitude of drunken people of both sexes, the women being of the lowest class; and all dancing, screaming and clapping their hands, like so many demons. All this was the effect of the "midnight mass," ending, as all such masses do, in every species of depravity.8<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Other white observers, though, were sometimes surprised to find themselves drawn in by the peculiar power of such African-derived rituals and festivities. Traveling in the mid-nineteenth century, Frederick Law Olmsted observed a black Christian service in New Orleans and was swept up by the "shouts, and groans, terrific shrieks, and indescribable expressions of ecstasy--of pleasure or agony," to the point where he found his own face "glowing" and feet stamping, as if he had been "infected unconsciously."9 Clinton Furness, a traveler to South Carolina in the 1920s, reported a similar experience while watching an African American ring-shout, or danced form of religious worship.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Several men moved their feet alternately, in strange syncopation. A rhythm was born, almost without reference to the words of the preacher. It seemed to take place almost visibly, and grow. I was gripped with the feeling of a mass-intelligence, a self-conscious entity, gradually informing the crowd and taking possession of every mind there, including my own&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I felt as if some conscious plan or purpose were carrying us along, call it mob-mind, communal composition, or what you will.10<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>On the whole, though, white observers regarded the ecstatic rituals of darker-skinned peoples with horror and revulsion. Grotesque is one word that appears again and again in European accounts of such events; hideous is another. Henri Junod, a nineteenth-century Swiss missionary among the Ba-Ronga people of southern Mozambique, complained of the drums' "frightful din" and "infernal racket."11 Other Catholic missionaries, upon hearing the African drumbeat announcing a ritual event, felt it was their duty to disrupt "the hellish practice."12 Well into the twentieth century, the sound of drumming was enough to spook the white traveler, suggestive as it was of a world beyond human ken. "I have never heard an eerier sound," a young English visitor to South Africa reports in the 1910 novel Prester John. "Neither human nor animal it seemed, but the voice of that world between which is hid from man's sight and hearing."13 In the introduction to his 1926 book on tribal dancing, the writer W. D. Hambly pleaded with his readers for a little "sympathy" for his subject.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The student of primitive music and dancing will have to cultivate a habit of broad-minded consideration for the actions of backward races&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Music and dancing performed wildly by firelight in a tropical forest have not seldom provoked the censure and disgust of European visitors, who have seen only what is grotesque or sensual.14<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Or, in many cases, may have elected not to see at all: When the intrepid entomologist Evelyn Cheeseman tramped through New Guinea in search of new insect species in the early 1930s, she showed not the slightest curiosity about the many native "dancing grounds" she passed through. At one village she and her bearers were asked to leave because there was to be a feast and dance that evening, which were tambu, or forbidden, for outsiders to witness. Cheeseman was miffed by this glitch in her plans but comforted herself with the thought that "it is of course well known that it is not particularly desirable to stop in a strange village when the natives are being worked up to their usual frenzy of devil worship."15<br>&nbsp;<br>Particularly disturbing to white observers was the occasional climax of ecstatic ritual, in which some or all of the participants would, after prolonged dancing and singing or chanting, enter what we might now call an "altered state of consciousness," or trance. People caught up in trance might speak in a strange voice or language, display a marked indifference to pain, contort their bodies in ways seemingly impossible in normal life, foam at the mouth, see visions, believe themselves to be possessed by a spirit or deity, and ultimately collapse.*<br>&nbsp;<br>A missionary among the Fiji Islanders described such a trance state as "a horrible sight,"16 but it was sight that was not always possible for the traveler to avoid. In her 1963 survey of the ethnographic literature, the anthropologist Erika Bourguignon found that 92 percent of small-scale societies surveyed encouraged some sort of religious trances, in most cases through ecstatic group ritual.17 In one of the many accounts of trance behavior among "primitive" peoples, the early-twentieth-century German scholar T. K. Oesterreich offers this, from a white visitor to Polynesia.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As soon as the god was supposed to have entered the priest, the latter became violently agitated, and worked himself up to the highest pitch of apparent frenzy, the muscles of the limbs seemed convulsed, the body swelled, the countenance became terrific, the features distorted, the eyes wild and strained. In this state he often rolled on the earth, foaming at the mouth.18<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Promiscuous sex was at least comprehensible to the European mind; even human sacrifice and cannibalism have echoes in Christian rite. But as the anthropologist Michael Taussig writes, "It's the ability to become possessed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;that signifies to Europeans awesome Otherness if not downright savagery."19 Trance was what many of those wild rituals seemed to lead up to, and for Europeans, it represented the very heart of darkness--a place beyond the human self.<br>&nbsp;<br>Or, what was worse--a place within the human self. In Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad's narrator observes an African ritual and reflects that<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>it was unearthly, and the men were--No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it--this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity--like yours--the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of their being a meaning in it which you--so remote from the night of first ages--could comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything.20<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>To Europeans, there was an obvious explanation for the ecstatic practices of native peoples around the world. Since these strange behaviors could be found in "primitive" cultures almost everywhere, and since they were never indulged in by the "civilized," it followed that they must result from some fundamental defect of the "savage mind." It was less stable than the civilized mind, more childlike, "plastic," and vulnerable to irrational influence or "autosuggestion."21 In some instances, the savage mind was described as "out of control" and lacking the discipline and restraint that Europeans of the seventeenth century and beyond came to see as their own defining characteristics. In other accounts, the savage was perhaps too much under control--of his or her "witch doctor," that is--or as a victim of "mob psychology."22 The American political scientist Frederick Morgan Davenport even proposed an anatomical explanation for the bizarre behavior of primitives: They had only a "single spinal ganglion" to process incoming sensory signals and convert them into muscular responses, while the civilized mind had, of course, an entire brain with which to assess the incoming data and weigh the body's responses.23 Hence the susceptibility of the savage to the compelling music and visual imagery of his or her culture's religious rituals--which was regrettable, since "the last thing the superstitious and impulsive negro race needs is a stirring of the emotions."24<br>&nbsp;<br>But if they thought about it, many Europeans must have realized that the group ecstasy so common among "natives" had certain parallels within Europe itself. For example, Catholic missionaries setting out from France after the 1730s would have heard about the heretical Parisian "convulsionary" cult, whose customary style of worship featured scenes as wild as anything that could be found among the "savages."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While the assembled company redoubled their prayers and collectively reached extreme heights of religious enthusiasm, at least one of their number would suddenly lapse into uncontrolled motor activity&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;They thrashed about on the floor in a state of frenzy, screaming, roaring, trembling, and twitching&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The excitement and the disordered movements, which might last for several hours, usually proved highly contagious, with certain convulsionaries apparently serving as a catalyst for the onset of various bodily agitations in others.25<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Later catalogers of "primitive" ecstatic behavior, like T. K. Oesterreich, recognized a more mundane European analogue to the bewildering rites of "savages" in the familiar tradition of carnival, where otherwise sober people costumed themselves, drank to excess, danced through the night, and otherwise inverted the normal staid and Christian order. "It must&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;be admitted," he wrote, "that civilized people show a high degree of autosuggestibility in certain circumstances. By way of example we may quote the peculiar psychic intoxication to which in certain places (e.g., Munich and Cologne) a large part of the population falls victim on a given day of the year (Carnival)."26 Critics of the traditional European festivities sometimes drove home their point by imagining the colonial encounter in reverse, with a "savage" registering shock at the behavior of European carnival-goers. In 1805, for example, a founder of the Basle Bible Society published a brochure entitled Conversation of a Converted Hottentot with a European Christian During Carnival Time, in which the "Hottentot" concludes that Basle is partially inhabited by "barbarous non-converted heathens." At the end of the nineteenth century, a similar pamphlet featured a visiting "converted Hindu," who confides that the wild doings at Basle's Fastnacht festivities put him in mind of "the idolatrous feasts and dances of my fellow-countrymen who are still heathens."27<br>&nbsp;<br>It was among their social inferiors, however, that Europeans found a more immediate analogue to the foreign "savage."

Today, Chef Eric Ripert carries on Gilbert's simplistic tradition with dishes such as Poached Halibut on Marinated Vegetables, Pan-Roasted Grouper with Wild Mushrooms and Artichokes, and Grilled Salmon with Mushroom Vinaigrette. And, of course, there are the desserts for which Le Bernardin is also so well known--from Chocolate Millefeuille to Honeyed Pear and Almond Cream Tarts.<br><br>Essential to the experience of dining at Le Bernardin and to the <i>Le Bernardin Cookbook</i> are the dynamic and charming personalities of Maguy Le Coze and Eric Ripert, whose lively dialogue and colorful anecdotes shine from these pages as brightly as the recipes themselves.</p><p>At Le Bernardin, seafood is always the star. From the day this posh restaurant opened in New York City, it was recognized for revolutionizing the way fish was prepared. Chef-owner Gilbert Le Coze and his sister, Maguy, quickly gained an exalted four-star rating for their original, impeccable, exquisite food, which you can now reproduce at home using their recipes.<p> Le Coze avoided using classic sauces because, lacking professional training, he did not know how to make them. Instead, he created Carpaccio of Tuna, a kind of paper-thin sashimi on a plate, Baked Sea Urchins, and Roast Monkfish on a Bed of Saut�ed Savory Cabbage with Bacon, a dish that is both rustic and rich. When Gilbert died in 1994, at just 48, his chef de cuisine, Eric Ripert, stepped in and has continued to dazzle with his own fish dishes. Ripert, who had a classical chef's training, is especially innovative in his Poached Lobster in Lemongrass-Ginger Bouillon. If following three pages of meticulously clear instructions for handling the lobsters, pur�eing their coral, and much more is not for you, try the salmon fillets served in a magically cream-free but creamy lemon sauce, the Roast Cod Ni�oise flavored with basil, capers, and black olives, or the saffron-and-orange-perfumed Fish Soup.</p><p> Le Bernardin's desserts are famous, too. A reasonably competent cook can create ecstasy with the Bitter Chocolate Souffl� Cake, lavish with dark chocolate, butter, eggs, and just one tablespoon of flour.</p><p> If you read mostly cookbooks, the spirited dialogue between Ripert and Maguy, their anecdotes of culinary adventures, and characteristically Gallic commentary may divert you. Typically, Maguy says, "My favorite way to eat calamari is with a nice green salad. How American!" Seems the French only ate a lettuce salad with meats until nouvelle cuisine came along in the 1970s, and Maguy still considers it an aberration with seafood. Just as her taste has changed, this book may open you to new experiences with seafood. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>Advance Praise for <i>Le Bernardin Cookbook:</i><p>"France's greatest gifts to America are both matchless expressions of uncomplicated elegance and perfect clarity: the Statue of Liberty in the 19th century and Le Bernardin in the 20th."<br>--Alan Richman, <i>GQ</i></p><p>"To dine at Le Bernardin is an unforgettable experience.

It was a long way away, maybe five hundred yards, and initially I wasn&#x2019;t sure what it was. Most of my focus was on my Border Collie Luke, who was running his fastest about two hundred yards away. I&#x2019;d sent him on a long out- run toward a flock of sheep during a &#x201c;fun day,&#x201d; when herding enthusiasts get together and revel in dogs and sheep and the sloppy kisses of young puppies.<br><br> Many people there that day were serious competitors in herding dog trials, and were grateful for the opportunity to hone their skills away from home. Luke and I, however, were there just for the pure joy of it. We loved working together, Luke and I, finessing sheep gently and quietly across the countryside. A classic workaholic, Luke loved working sheep so much he had no interest in food, tennis balls, or even bitches in heat when there was a job to do. For me, watching my trustworthy black-and-white dog doing a perfect outrun on an emerald-green hill made my heart get bigger and my soul feel full. That&#x2019;s how I was feeling that morning as I watched my good old dog run perfectly and reliably toward the woolies on the far hill.<br><br> But all my feelings changed as I realized that the white blur running toward Luke was a hundred-and-twenty-pound working Great Pyrenees who had escaped temporary confinement and was barreling down on Luke to protect his flock. We were on a large, isolated farm with several dispersed flocks of sheep&#x2014;a smorgasbord to the coyotes and stray dogs that commonly roam the countryside. Many of us in southern Wisconsin need working guard dogs to keep our flocks safe, and this farm had two of them. Unlike my guard dog, Tulip, who now protects the farm from the living room couch, these dogs lived exclusively with the flock, and were serious to the bone about killing anything that threatened their sheep.<br><br> As I watched the guard dog run toward Luke, my feelings of joyful fulfillment were transformed into abject terror. The thought that I was about to watch my dog being attacked and possibly killed overwhelmed me. I love Luke so much it almost hurts.In Dog Is My Co-pilot, in an essay about why we love dogs so much, I said about Luke: &#x201c;And I still love him so deeply and completely that I imagine his death to be as if all the oxygen in the air disappeared, and I was left to try to survive without it.&#x201d;<br><br> Horrified at what I thought was about to happen, I screamed, &#x201c;The guard dog is out, the guard dog is out!&#x201d; Stating the obvious wasn&#x2019;t going to solve the problem, but it seemed to be all I could do. For the longest second imaginable, my mind was a black hole, as if my emotions had sucked away the rational part of my brain and left a cavernous skull full of nothing but fear. I can remember that terror now, and can visualize the scene as if in a photograph: emerald-green pasture, black-and-white Luke in full stride just where he ought to be, and a white bullet of doom streaking across the grass toward him.<br><br> But what of Luke? What went through his mind as he dashed through in the grass with a canine hitman running toward him? Was he as scared as I was? And if he was, how much did his version of being scared resemble mine?<br> Luke and I were best friends, just as many dogs and humans are best friends all over the world. As friends do, we shared long cool walks in shady forests, tasty dinners of roast chicken or lamb, and long sleepy cuddles on the couch in the depth of winter. We shared hard times loading wild-eyed market lambs on to the truck, getting lost on back highways late at night while traveling, and making mistakes while working sheep that cost us valuable time, energy, and on occasion, a blue ribbon at a herding dog trial. We played together, worked together, comforted each other, and had an occasional spat. In many ways, our lives were bound together as tightly as the lives of two human best friends.<br><br> But all those experiences don&#x2019;t say much about how we experienced the world inside our heads. We may have shared external experiences like walks in the woods and napping on the couch, but what of our internal experience? How much of that did we share? I&#x2019;ve said that sometimes Luke lost his temper with me&#x2014;but how could I know that? Without language as a bridge, how can any of us really know what goes on inside the heads of our dogs?<br><br> In one sense, we can&#x2019;t. We can&#x2019;t ever know what it is like to be a dog; some argue we shouldn&#x2019;t even try. But many of us try to understand the mental lives of our dogs every day, and we&#x2019;re not going to give up just because the task is difficult. One of my earliest childhood memories is of lying on the living room floor wondering what was going on in the mind of my dog, Fudge. I wanted to know what she was thinking, what she was feeling. Even at the age of five or six I wondered, What is life like inside her soft, furry little head? Is she happy? Is she sad?<br><br> These are reasonable questions for any dog lover to ask. Our emotional connection to our dogs is the fundamental glue that binds us to them, and it&#x2019;s natural to want to know more about their emotional connections to us. We can&#x2019;t have long intellectual discussions with our dogs as we do with our human friends; perhaps that&#x2019;s part of the attraction. Our intelligence and ability to use language can make our human relationships pretty complicated, as any marriage and family therapist can tell you. Our relationships with dogs are simpler in many ways than our relationships with people, but simplicity doesn&#x2019;t necessarily make something less important. E = mc2 is simple, but it&#x2019;s an equation of great value. Perhaps our emotional connection to dogs is similar: pure, primal, and as basic as oxygen and water.<br> I don&#x2019;t remember whether I ran forward or stood frozen in fear during that endless second when Luke was in danger, but it was only a moment or two before a woman behind me calmly said, &#x201c;Down your dog.&#x201d; I will forever be grateful to her, because this was perfect advice. A working guard dog is unlikely to be aggressive to a dog who lies down and stays still when approached, rather than running at the sheep like a hungry wolf. &#x201c;Lie down!&#x201d; I bellowed, and two hundred yards away, Luke hit the dirt like a Marine on maneuvers.<br><br> If Luke had been a much younger dog, he might have kept running. Asking a dog to stop on his outrun goes against his nature, and although an experienced trial-ready dog should be able to do it, it&#x2019;s an advanced skill that takes some serious teamwork to achieve.<br><br> Luke&#x2019;s age and training might have saved his life, because he dropped to the ground at my first request. Just in time: the guard dog got to him within seconds. &#x201c;Stay there,&#x201d; I said in a low, steady voice, finally coming to my senses enough to be able to function. Luke stayed motionless, glued to the hillside, while the Pyrenees sniffed him from head to toe. (Well, really it was from rear end to muzzle, but you know what I mean.)<br><br> Although I was still terrified about what might happen to Luke, my brain was working again, and I was able to remember that my own guard dog insisted on inspecting any visiting dog from tail to collar. Tulip has been aggressive toward a visiting dog only once&#x2014;when it ran away from her instead of standing still for scrutiny. I&#x2019;m reminded of airport security guards, who are benevolent if we accept their inspections, but who react instantly to anyone who resists. Tulip behaves in a similar way, and once she&#x2019;s cleared canine travelers of harboring some doggy equivalent of sharp objects, she ignores them or invites them to play. That&#x2019;s exactly what happened that morning at the fun day. After a round of intense sniffing, the dog trotted off to check in with his flock. Soon his owner came and put him away, and Luke was able to complete his outrun and ease the sheep down the hill to me.<br><br> We had a great time working the flock after the interlude with the guard dog, and drove home tired from our day outside in the fresh air. Later I told a client about what had happened, and she suggested that Luke had probably been traumatized by it. &#x201c;Look at poor old Brandy here [the dog lying at her feet, in my office for a serious case of dog-dog aggression]. He&#x2019;s never gotten over being attacked by that Black Lab at the dog park. You can see it right now in his eyes.&#x201d;<br><br> It was hard to see Brandy&#x2019;s eyes, covered as they were by champagne- colored bangs, but what I could see looked pretty much like the eyes of a dog happily chewing on the bone I&#x2019;d provided. I&#x2019;m not saying Brandy couldn&#x2019;t have been traumatized at the dog park. (We&#x2019;ll talk later about how traumatic events can affect the behavior of a dog years after their occurrence, just as they can in humans.) But if I had to make my own guess about what internal state Brandy&#x2019;s eyes were expressing in my office, it would have been contentment, not trauma.<br><br> WHAT ARE EMOTIONS, ANYWAY?<br><br> It&#x2019;s not surprising that people don&#x2019;t always agree with others about what emotion their dog is feeling. Emotions are complicated things, and it&#x2019;s worth taking a fresh look at them before we try to expand our understanding of our dogs&#x2019; emotional lives.<br><br> Emotions may be primitive and primal, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean they are easy to understand. Now that we&#x2019;re finally getting around to studying them, emotions are turning out to be amazingly interesting and complicated biological processes. Most scientists agree that mammals such as dogs are capable of basic emotions like fear, anger, and happiness, but they don&#x2019;t agree on how they actually experience them. Surely, on the one hand it&#x2019;s a simple issue&#x2014;if Luke saw an aggressive dog running toward him, why wouldn&#x2019;t he be fearful in much the same way that I was?<br><br> Ah, but on the other hand being scared is an emotional experience driven by the brain, and the only simple thing about the brain is the fact that we still haven&#x2019;t begun to comprehend it. No wonder: there are about a hundred billion neurons in the human brain, all linked together by ten trillion connections. Because of this level of complexity, our understanding of the biology of emotions is primitive at best. This makes it especially challenging to compare emotions in people and dogs, but the last few decades of research have taught us so much about the biology of emotions that it&#x2019;s more than reasonable to try. A good place to start is an examination of what we know about our own emotions.<br><br> Surely we all know what we&#x2019;re talking about when we&#x2019;re discussing emotions, but what would you say if someone asked you to define them? Beyond the labels we give them&#x2014;fear, anger, joy&#x2014;what exactly are emotions, and how are they created inside you? If you struggle with a precise definition, don&#x2019;t feel bad: you&#x2019;re not alone. According to Antonio Damasio, an internationally acclaimed expert on emotion and the brain, our feelings are the least understood of all mental phenomena. They are also the most ubiquitous and probably the most ancient, so it&#x2019;s surprising that we&#x2019;ve only recently attempted to sort them out. It took scientists like Damasio to dismiss the arguments of early behaviorists that we shouldn&#x2019;t attempt to understand emotions because, as subjective internal processes, they were &#x201c;beyond the bounds of science.&#x201d; It turns out that&#x2019;s not even close to true; Damasio and others have proven that the biology of emotion is as accessible as the biology of hearing, vision, or memory.<br><br> This doesn&#x2019;t mean that research on emotions is easy. Emotions are slippery things, in some ways as hard to separate from our bodies and minds as it is to separate egg yolks from egg whites once you&#x2019;ve mixed them together. As the neurologist John Ratey says: &#x201c;Emotion is messy, complicated, primitive, and undefined because it&#x2019;s all over the place.&#x201d; You can&#x2019;t sit back and examine your own emotions as if in a petri dish, because they come along with you. We do know that emotions&#x2014;like joy, fear, and anger affect the mind and body in predictable ways. An emotion like fear includes physiological changes in your body (your heart starts pounding when you see your dog running toward the road), visible changes in expression (you freeze in place, your pupils dilate, your eyes widen), conscious thoughts (&#x201c;Oh no! There&#x2019;s a car coming!&#x201d;), and feelings (your conscious experience of fear and panic). Thus, every emotion includes (1) changes in the body; (2) changes in expression; and (3) the feelings and thoughts that go along with them.</p><h2>The Piper&#39;s Pursuit</h2><p><p><strong>From&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>New York Times</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;bestselling author Melanie Dickerson comes a fresh reimagining of the classic&nbsp;</strong><em><strong>Pied Piper</strong></em><strong>&nbsp;tale.</strong></p><p>A plague of rats.

Witty and informative at the same time, Isserlis introduces us to six of his favorite composers: the sublime genius Bach, the quicksilver Mozart, Beethoven with his gruff humor, the shy Schumann, the prickly Brahms and that extraordinary split personality, Stravinsky. Isserlis brings the composers alive in an irresistible manner that can't fail to catch the attention of any child whose ear has been caught by any of the music described, or anyone entering the world of classical music for the first time. The lively black and white line illustrations provide a perfect accompaniment to the text, and make this book attractive and accessible for children to enjoy on their own or share with an adult.</p><p><i>Why Beethoven Threw the Stew</i><br><br>Why did Bach's son call him 'The Old Wig'?<br>What part did Stravinsky's parrot play at dinner parties?<br>How did Mozart keep his pigtails styled?<br>What did Schumann invent to make his fingers stronger?<br>And why <i>did</i> Beethoven throw his stew?<br><br>This book is a unique introduction for children to the world of classical composers and their music.<br><br>Famous cellist Steven Isserlis brings six of his favorite composers to life in an irresistible manner, painting hilarious biographical portraits of each of them and describing their music in lively detail. Packed with facts, dates, anecdotes and illustrations, <i>Why Beethoven Threw the Stew</i> is an attractive and accessible read for children (and their parents!).<br><b>Steven Isserlis</b> was born at a fairly early age. His whole family was musical-- his father plays the violin, his mother played the piano, and his two sisters play the violin and viola-- so he took up the cello because he didn't want to get left out.<br><br>He soon decided that playing the cello was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life (partly because it meant that he wouldn't have to get up too early in the morning to get to work). These days, he travels all over the world, playing concerts to whoever wants to listen (and to a few who don't too) and making recordings. He studied in England, Scotland and America; his main teacher was a wonderfully eccentric lady called Jane Cowan who convinced him that he had to become friends with the composers whose music he played. In 1998, he was awarded a CBE, for 'services to music' (though privately, he suspects it was because of his looks); and in 2000, the city of Zwickau (birthplace of the composer Robert Schumann, to whom a chapter of this book is devoted) bestowed the Schumann Prize 2000 upon his curly head. Steven lives in London, with Pauline (who tries to keep him in order), his son Gabriel (who manages to keep him in disorder), lots of cellos and a piano. He has a few hobbies, but what he likes best (apart from listening to music and reading books, perhaps) is to eat lots of food.<br></p><h2>Natural Hormone Balance for Women: Look Younger, Feel Stronger, and Live Life with Exuberance</h2><p>A pioneering gynecologist and antiaging specialist with a successful Beverly Hills practice, Dr. Uzzi Reiss shows the way for women who want to turn back the effects of time through natural hormone therapy, but who wonder: is it safe? Does it work? Is hormone therapy right for me?<br><br><i>Natural Hormone Balance for Women</i> is Dr. Reiss's breakthrough, step-by-step program for women who want to take control of their lives by restoring hormonal balance. This revolutionary, commonsense natural hormone replacement program is designed to meet the individual needs of most women looking to rejuvenate body and mind&#x2014;and offers astounding benefits for women of all ages:<br> <br> More energy and stamina * Improved memory * Healthier, more youthful skin * Balanced moods * Less depression and anxiety * Stabilization of weight and more muscle definition * Better sleep patterns * PMS and menopausal symptoms reduced or eliminated * Enhanced sexuality<br> <br> Dr. Reiss takes the confusion out of the medical information you need to know. In clear, nontechnical language, he thoroughly explains:<br> <br> -the important difference between standard chemical hormone prescriptions and natural hormone replacements<br> -which hormone replacements are best for you and how to adjust them to your maximum individual benefit<br> -how to take hormones without worry<br> -how to choose the most effective hormonal gel, cream, pill, or sublingual drops, and when to use them.<br> <br> Dr. Reiss has helped thousands of women transform their lives by achieving natural hormone balance. Now you can tap into the replenishing "fountain of youthfulness" that is not only essential for better life, but easier and safer to achieve than ever before.</p><p>In <i>Natural Hormone Balance for Women</i>, Beverly Hills obstetrician-gynecologist Uzzi Reiss makes it clear that he believes in hormone replacement therapy for women, but not the "chemicalized hormonal substitutes" usually prescribed. "I emphasize natural hormones that are precise replicas of your own hormones," he writes, which can increase energy and memory, decrease symptoms of menopause and PMS, improve skin and mood, and enhance sleep, sexuality, and well-being. But neither the widely used hormonal medications, such as estrogens derived from horse urine, nor the "natural" hormonal products derived from soy or yams replicate the hormones produced by a woman's body. Rather, he recommends a natural estrogen formula balanced with natural progesterone, both available through compounding pharmacies (with a doctor's prescription).<p> Dr. Reiss and talented cowriter Martin Zucker explain why, how, and when to use natural hormones. This is not a snappy, one-size-fits-all program--rather, you, with the involvement of your physician, learn how to analyze your needs and individualize your treatment for your own optimal hormonal balance. Reiss describes the benefits and uses of natural estrogen and progesterone, then discusses other natural hormones that might be helpful: testosterone, human growth hormone, DHEA, melatonin, and pregnenolone. This is a provocative book that's worth sharing with your doctor. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>Dr. Uzzi Reiss is an internationally recognized thought-leader on the subject of safe hormone replacement, including on the use of estrogen to treat breast cancer, and a champion for women&#x2019;s voices in the management of their own healthcare. Over his long career, Dr. Reiss has remained at the forefront of medical innovation, beginning with his research on the role of prostaglandins in the cessation of pre-mature labor, and in private practice, as a pioneer in the safe use of bio-identical hormones to treat cancer, PMS, infertility, menopause, and other hormone-related conditions in thousands of patients. He speaks widely to physicians and academics throughout the world, attesting to how these approaches have bettered the wellbeing and lives of the thousands of women whom he has treated. He is the author of <i>Natural Hormone Balance for Women</i>, <i>The Natural Superwoman</i>, <i>How to Make a Pregnant Woman Happy</i>, and <i>How to Make a New Mother Happy. </i>Married since 1972, Dr. Reiss is the father of three grown children and grandparent to five. He lives in Los Angeles.</p><h2>Men of Mathematics (Touchstone Book)</h2><p>From one of the greatest minds in contemporary mathematics, Professor E.T. Bell, comes a witty, accessible, and fascinating look at the beautiful craft and enthralling history of mathematics.<br><br><i>Men of Mathematics</i> provides a rich account of major mathematical milestones, from the geometry of the Greeks through Newton&#x2019;s calculus, and on to the laws of probability, symbolic logic, and the fourth dimension. Bell breaks down this majestic history of ideas into a series of engrossing biographies of the great mathematicians who made progress possible&#x2014;and who also led intriguing, complicated, and often surprisingly entertaining lives. <br><br>Never pedantic or dense, Bell writes with clarity and simplicity to distill great mathematical concepts into their most understandable forms for the curious everyday reader. Anyone with an interest in math may learn from these rich lessons, an advanced degree or extensive research is never necessary.</p><p><b>Eric Temple Bell</b> was born in 1883 in Aberdeen, Scotland. His early education was obtained in England. Coming to the United States in 1902, he entered Stanford University and took his A.B. degree in 1904. In 1908 he was teaching fellow at the University of Washington, where he took his A.M. degree in 1909. In 1911 he entered Columbia University, where he took his Ph.D. degree in 1912. He returned to the University of Washington as instructor in mathematics and became full professor in 1921. During the summers of 1924-28 he taught at the University of Chicago, and in 1926 (first half) at Harvard University, when he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology. <p> Dr. Bell was a former President of the Mathematical Association of America, a former Vice President of the American Mathematical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was on the editorial staffs of the <i>Transactions of the American Mathematical Society,</i> the <i>American Journal of Mathematics,</i> and the <i>Journal of the Philosophy of Science.</i> He belonged to The American Mathematical Society, the Mathematical Association of America, the Circolo Matematico di Palermo, the Calcutta Mathematical Society, Sigma Xi, and Phi Beta Kappa, and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States. He won the B�cher Prize of the American Mathematical Society for his research work. His twelve published books include <i>The Purple Sapphire</i> (1924), <i>Algebraic Arithmetic</i> (1927), <i>Debunking Science,</i> and <i>Queen of the Sciences</i> (1931), <i>Numerology</i> (1933), and <i>The Search for Truth</i> (1934). </p><p> Dr. Bell died in December 1960, just before the publication of his latest book, <i>The Last Problem.</i></p><b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br><b>Introduction</b><br><br>This section is headed <i>Introduction</i> rather than <i>Preface</i> (which it really is) in the hope of decoying habitual preface-skippers into reading -- for their own comfort -- at least the following paragraphs down to the first row of stars before going on to meet some of the great mathematicians. I should like to emphasize first that this book is not intended, in any sense, to be a history of mathematics, or any section of such a history.<br><br>The lives of mathematicians presented here are addressed to the general reader and to others who may wish to see what sort of human beings the men were who created <i>modern</i> mathematics. Our object is to lead up to some of the dominating ideas governing vast tracts of mathematics as it exists today and to do this through the lives of the men responsible for those ideas.<br><br>Two criteria have been applied in selecting names for inclusion: the importance for modern mathematics of a man's work; the human appeal of the man's life and character. Some qualify under both heads, for example Pascal, Abel, and Galois; others, like Gauss and Cayley, chiefly under the first, although both had interesting lives. When these criteria clash or overlap in the case of several claimants to remembrance for a particular advance, the second has been given precedence as we are primarily interested here in mathematicians as human beings.<br><br>Of recent years there has been a tremendous surge of general interest in science, particularly physical science, and its bearing on our rapidly changing philosophical outlook on the universe. Numerous excellent accounts of current advances in science, written in as un-technical language as possible, have served to lessen the gap between the professional scientist and those who must make their livings at something other than science. In many of these expositions, especially those concerned with relativity and the modern quantum theory, names occur with which the general reader cannot be expected to be familiar -- Gauss, Cayley, Riemann, and Hermite, for instance. With a knowledge of who these men were, their part in preparing for the explosive growth of physical science since 1900, and an appreciation of their rich personalities, the magnificent achievements of science fall into a truer perspective and take on a new significance.<br><br>The great mathematicians have played a part in the evolution of scientific and philosophic thought comparable to that of the philosophers and scientists themselves. To portray the leading features of that part through the lives of master mathematicians, presented against a background of some of the dominant problems of their times, is the purpose of the following chapters. The emphasis is wholly on modern mathematics, that is, on those great and simple guiding ideas of mathematical thought that are still of vital importance in living, creative science and mathematics.<br><br>It must not be imagined that the sole function of mathematics -- "the handmaiden of the sciences" -- is to serve science. Mathematics has also been called "the Queen of the Sciences." If occasionally the Queen has seemed to beg from the sciences she has been a very proud sort of beggar, neither asking nor accepting favors from any of her more affluent sister sciences. What she gets she pays for. Mathematics has a light and wisdom of its own, above any possible application to science, and it will richly reward any intelligent human being to catch a glimpse of what mathematics means to itself. This is not the old doctrine of art for art's sake; it is art for humanity's sake. After all, the whole purpose of science is not technology -- God knows we have gadgets enough already; science also explores depths of a universe that will never, by any stretch of the imagination, be visited by human beings or affect our material existence. So we shall attend also to some of the things which the great mathematicians have considered worthy of loving understanding for their intrinsic beauty.<br><br>Plato is said to have inscribed "Let no man ignorant of geometry enter here" above the entrance to his Academy. No similar warning need be posted here, but a word of advice may save some overconscientious reader unnecessary anguish. The gist of the story is in the lives and personalities of the creators of modern mathematics, not in the handful of formulas and diagrams scattered through the text. The basic ideas of modern mathematics, from which the whole vast and intricate complexity has been woven by thousands of workers, are simple, of boundless scope, and well within the understanding of any human being with normal intelligence. Lagrange (whom we shall meet later) believed that a mathematician has not thoroughly understood his own work till he has made it so clear that he can go out and explain it effectively to the first man he meets on the street.<br><br>This of course is an ideal and not always attainable. But it may be recalled that only a few years before Lagrange said this the Newtonian "law" of gravitation was an incomprehensible mystery to even highly educated persons. Yesterday the Newtonian "law" was a commonplace which every educated person accepted as simple and true; today Einstein's relativistic theory of gravitation is where Newton's "law" was in the early decades of the eighteenth century; to-morrow or the day after Einstein's theory will seem as "natural" as Newton's "law" seemed yesterday. With the help of time Lagrange's ideal is not unattainable.<br><br>Another great French mathematician, conscious of his own difficulties no less than his readers', counselled the conscientious not to linger too long over anything hard but to "Go on, and faith will come to you." In brief, if occasionally a formula, a diagram, or a paragraph seems too technical, skip it. There is ample in what remains.<br><br>Students of mathematics are familiar with the phenomenon of "slow development," or subconscious assimilation: the first time something new is studied the details seem too numerous and hopelessly confused, and no coherent impression of the whole is left on the mind. Then, on returning after a rest, it is found that everything has fallen into place with its proper emphasis -- like the development of a photographic film. The majority of those who attack analytic geometry seriously for the first time experience something of the sort. The calculus on the other hand, with its aims clearly stated from the beginning, is usually grasped quickly. Even professional mathematicians often skim the work of others to gain a broad, comprehensive view of the whole before concentrating on the details of interest to them. Skipping is not a vice, as some of us were told by our puritan teachers, but a virtue of common sense.<br><br>As to the amount of mathematical knowledge necessary to understand <i>everything</i> that some will wisely skip, I believe it may be said honestly that a high school course in mathematics is sufficient. Matters far beyond such a course are frequently mentioned, but wherever they are, enough description has been given to enable anyone with high school mathematics to follow. For some of the most important ideas discussed in connection with their originators -- groups, space of many dimensions, non-Euclidean geometry, and symbolic logic, for example -- <i>less</i> than a high school course is ample for an understanding of the basic concepts. All that is needed is interest and an undistracted head. Assimilation of some of these invigorating ideas of modem mathematical thought will be found as refreshing as a drink of cold water on a hot day and as inspiring as any art.<br><br>To facilitate the reading, important definitions have been repeated where necessary, and frequent references to earlier chapters have been included from time to time.<br><br>The chapters need not be read consecutively. In fact, those with a speculative or philosophical turn of mind may prefer to read the last chapter first. With a few trivial displacements to fit the social background the chapters follow the chronological order.<br><br>It would be impossible to describe <i>all</i> the work of even the least prolific of the men considered, nor would it be profitable in an account for the general reader to attempt to do so. Moreover, much of the work of even the greater mathematicians of the past is now of only historical interest, having been included in more general points of view. Accordingly only some of the conspicuously new things each man did are described, and these have been selected for their originality and importance in modern thought.<br><br>Of the topics selected for description we may mention the following (among others) as likely to interest the general reader: the modem doctrine of the infinite (chapters 2, 29); the origin of mathematical probability (chapter 5); the concept and importance of a group (chapter 15); the meanings of invariance (chapter 21); non-Euclidean geometry (chapter 16 and part of 14); the origin of the mathematics of general relativity (last part of chapter 26); properties of the common whole numbers (chapter 4), and their modem generalization (chapter 25); the meaning and usefulness of so-called imaginary numbers -- like [underroot-1] (chapters 14, 19); symbolic reasoning (chapter 23). But anyone who wishes to get a glimpse of the power of the mathematical method, especially as applied to science, will be repaid by seeing what the calculus is about (chapters 2, 6).<br><br>Modem mathematics began with two great advances, analytic geometry and the calculus. The former took definite shape in 1637, the latter about 1666, although it did not become public property till a decade later. Though the idea behind it all is childishly simple, yet the method of analytic geometry is so powerful that very ordinary boys of seventeen can use it to prove results which would have baffled the greatest of the Greek geometers -- Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius. The man, Descartes, who finally crystallized this great method had a particularly full and interesting life.<br><br>In saying that Descartes was responsible for the creation of analytic geometry we do not mean to imply that the new method sprang full-armed from his mind alone. Many before him had made significant advances toward the new method, but it remained for Descartes to take the final step and actually to put out the method as a definitely workable engine of geometrical proof, discovery, and invention. But even Descartes must share the honor with Fermat.<br><br>Similar remarks apply to most of the other advances of modem mathematics. A new concept may be "in the air" for generations until some one man -- occasionally two or three together -- sees clearly the essential detail that his predecessors missed, and the new thing comes into being. Relativity, for example, is sometimes said to have been the great invention reserved by time for the genius of Minkowski. The fact is, however, that Minkowski did not create the theory of relativity and that Einstein did. It seems rather meaningless to say that So-and-so might have done this or that if circumstances had been other than they were. Any one of us no doubt could jump over the moon if we and the physical universe were different from what we and it are, but the truth is that we do not make the jump.<br><br>In other instances, however, the credit for some great advance is not always justly placed, and the man who first used a new method more powerfully than its inventor sometimes gets more than his due. This seems to be the case, for instance, in the highly important matter of the calculus. Archimedes had the fundamental notion of limiting sums from which the integral calculus springs, and he not only had the notion but showed that he could apply it. Archimedes also used the method of the differential calculus in one of his problems. As we approach Newton and Leibniz in the seventeenth century the history of the calculus becomes extremely involved. The new method was more than merely "in the air" before Newton and Leibniz brought it down to earth; Fermat actually had it. He also invented the method of Cartesian geometry independently of Descartes. In spite of indubitable facts such as these we shall follow tradition and ascribe to each great leader what a majority vote says he should have, even at the risk of giving him a little more than his just due. Priority after all gradually loses its irritating importance as we recede in time from the men to whom it was a hotly contested cause of verbal battles while they and their partisans lived.<br><br>Those who have never known a professional mathematician may be rather surprised on meeting some, for mathematicians as a class are probably less familiar to the general reader than any other group of brain workers. The mathematician is a much rarer character in fiction than his cousin the scientist, and when he does appear in the pages of a novel or on the screen he is only too apt to be a slovenly dreamer totally devoid of common sense -- comic relief. What sort of mortal is he in real life? Only by seeing in detail what manner of men some of the <i>great</i> mathematicians were and what kind of lives they lived, can we recognize the ludicrous untruth of the traditional portrait of a mathematician.<br><br>Strange as it may seem, not all of the great mathematicians have been professors in colleges or universities. Quite a few were soldiers by profession; others went into mathematics from theology, the law, and medicine, and one of the greatest was as crooked a diplomat as ever lied for the good of his country. A few have had no profession at all. Stranger yet, not all professors of mathematics have been mathematicians. But this should not surprise us when we think of the gulf between the average professor of poetry drawing a comfortable salary and the poet starving to death in his garret.<br><br>The lives that follow will at least suggest that a mathematician can be as human as anybody else -- sometimes distressingly more so. In ordinary social contacts the majority have been normal. There have been eccentrics in mathematics, of course; but the percentage is no higher than in commerce or the professions. As a group the great mathematicians have been men of all-round ability, vigorous, alert, keenly interested in many things outside of mathematics and, in a fight, men with their full share of backbone. As a rule mathematicians have been bad customers to persecute; they have usually been capable of returning what they received with compound interest. For the rest they were geniuses of tremendous accomplishment marked off from the majority of their gifted fellowmen only by an irresistible impulse to do mathematics. On occasion mathematicians have been (and some still are in France) extremely able administrators.<br><br>In their politics the great mathematicians have ranged over the whole spectrum from reactionary conservatism to radical liberalism. It is probably correct to say that as a class they have tended slightly to the left in their political opinions. Their religious beliefs have included everything from the narrowest orthodoxy -- sometimes shading into the blackest bigotry -- to complete skepticism. A few were dogmatic and positive in their assertions concerning things about which they knew nothing, but most have tended to echo the great Lagrange's "I do not know."<br><br>Another characteristic calls for mention here, as several writers and artists (some from Hollywood) have asked that it be treated -- the sex life of great mathematicians. In particular these inquirers wish to know how many of the great mathematicians have been perverts -- a somewhat indelicate question, possibly, but legitimate enough to merit a serious answer in these times of preoccupation with such topics. None. Some lived celibate lives, usually on account...</p><h2>A Is for Altar, B Is for Bible</h2><p>Here is the lovely book every child and parent will want to read together, and every grandparent and godparent will want to give as a gift!

Instead of making a run for it, he&#x2019;d grabbed a woman and was now holed up, shooting away. Where he had found a semiautomatic weapon, plus enough ammunition to take out Khartoum, Nicholas didn&#x2019;t know. He didn&#x2019;t care about the answer, only wanted this to end peaceably. </p><p>At least the hostage hadn&#x2019;t been killed yet. She was a middle-aged woman, now lying on her side maybe six feet from the shooter, trussed up with duct tape. They could see her face, leached of color and terrified. He could imagine her screams of terror if her mouth weren&#x2019;t taped. </p><p>No, she wasn&#x2019;t dead. Yet. Which presented a problem&#x2014;one wrong move and a bullet would go into her head. </p><p>Nicholas glanced over his shoulder at his second, Detective In�spector Gareth Scott, tucked against the curb, his expression edgy, a flash of excitement in his eyes. He clutched his Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 against his chest. His Glock 17 was in its shoulder holster. </p><p>The suspect stopped firing his weapon, and there was sudden blessed silence. Nicholas didn&#x2019;t think the guy had run out of bul�lets. Had the gun jammed? They should be so lucky. What was he thinking? Planning? </p><p>Nicholas dropped down beside Gareth. &#x201c;We have ourselves a crazy. Brief me on the rest.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We have a photo, taken from the eastern rooftop. It&#x2019;s blurred, but Facial Recognition did their magic. The guy&#x2019;s name is Es�posito, out of prison only a month. I guess he woke up real early and decided he needed some excitement in his life and went on this little rampage.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;What set him off?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know. He took four quid out of the kiosk till, all the guy had at this hour of the morning, and grabbed the woman when the police showed up.&#x201d; </p><p>Esposito raised his weapon again and blasted half a dozen bul�lets into the foggy morning air. </p><p>Nicholas saw a brief glimpse of the man&#x2019;s head, but the angle made it impossible for the snipers to take him out. He wouldn&#x2019;t give them permission to fire anyway, not if there was a chance of hitting the woman. He had to make a decision&#x2014;time was run�ning short. </p><p>Nicholas glanced at his watch. 5:16 a.m., an ungodly hour in winter, barely light enough to see. At least it wasn&#x2019;t raining, but clouds were fat and black overhead. All they needed to make this a real party. </p><p>Esposito continued shooting, then stopped mid-blast and shouted, &#x201c;You stupid coppers back off or she&#x2019;s dead, you hear me? I&#x2019;ll let her go as soon as I&#x2019;m clear!&#x201d; </p><p>There was return gunfire, and Esposito screamed, &#x201c;Shoot at me again and I swear I&#x2019;ll kill her. Back off. Back off!&#x201d; </p><p>Nicholas shouted, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll back off. Don&#x2019;t hurt the woman.&#x201d; </p><p>Esposito&#x2019;s answer was a bullet that flew a couple of feet over Nicholas&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Enough,&#x201d; Nicholas said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get him.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;You want him alive?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; Nicholas said. &#x201c;We need a better angle. Follow me.&#x201d; </p><p>They duck-walked across the street, then flattened, faces to the ground, just before fusillade of bullets kicked up gravel two feet away from their earlier position. Gareth cursed. &#x201c;At least the guy&#x2019;s a lousy shot.&#x201d; </p><p>Silence again, except for their fast breaths. Nicholas didn&#x2019;t think Esposito had seen them move. &#x201c;Keep still and stay down,&#x201d; he whis�pered. They were only twenty yards downwind now, sheltered by the construction in front of the station&#x2019;s fa�ade. A good spot, though if Esposito moved, turned, he might very well see them and they&#x2019;d be dead. </p><p>Almost as if he knew what they were doing, Esposito grabbed the woman, held her in front of him as a shield and dragged her fifteen feet before pulling her down behind a big metal construc�tion bin. Now Esposito was facing away from them, a good thirty feet from their position. He was squatted down behind the bin, leaning around the side to check for threats, ready to fire. </p><p>And Nicholas thought, This is surely a gift from the Almighty. He was staring at the bottom of the construction bin. Its base was at least three inches off the ground. He smiled as he smoothly rolled onto his belly and pulled his Glock 17 from his shoulder holster. He aimed at those three precious inches on the underside of the bin, sighting carefully. The guy had big feet in shiny white Nikes, a bull&#x2019;s-eye target if there ever was one. </p><p>Nicholas squeezed the trigger. The man yelped and hopped away from the bin, stumbled, and went down hard on the&nbsp; pavement. </p><p>&#x201c;Take him now!&#x201d; Nicholas yelled into his shoulder radio. He jumped to his feet as he spoke. &#x201c;And do mind his weapon, people.&#x201d; </p><p>His team rushed to surround Esposito, who&#x2019;d fallen five feet from his hiding place behind the bin. He saw them running at him and slammed his weapon to the ground, threw his arms up in surrender, and the standoff was over. And no one was dead, or even badly hurt. </p><p>A metallic horn rang out signaling the engagement was over. </p><p>Gareth clapped his boss on the shoulder. &#x201c;Nice one,&#x201d; he said, then called out, &#x201c;A-Team, to me.&#x201d; </p><p>A smattering of applause made Nicholas turn, but before he could holster his Glock, a voice boomed over the loudspeaker. &#x201c;Detective Chief Inspector Drummond. You have broken the rules of engagement, and are hereby disqualified. Report to me immediately.&#x201d; </p><p><br></p></p><h2>Golf Is a Game of Confidence</h2><p>From the author of the bestselling <i>Golf is Not a Game of Perfect</i> comes a masterly illumination of golf's mental game.<br><br>When that book was published, Dr Bob Rotella made accessible for the first time what he had learned from working with the best golfers in the world.

How rare is America&#39;s experiment with a republic? With every crisis, is power being taken away from &#34;the people&#34; and transfered to the central government. Does history give us a clue as to where all this is all headed? George Washington warned in his Farewell Address, 1796: &#34;Disorders and miseries...gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an Individual...[who] turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public...and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism.&#34; Ronald Reagan stated at St. John&#39;s University, NY, March 28, 1985: &#34;Government that is big enough to give you everything you want is more likely to simply take everything you&#39;ve got.&#34; Woodrow Wilson warned in New York, 1912: &#34;The history of Liberty is a history of limitations of governmental power, not the increase of it. When we resist, therefore, the concentration of power, we are resisting the powers of death, because concentration of power is what always precedes the destruction of human liberties.&#34; In the nearly 6,000 years of recorded human history, power, like gravity, seems to inevitably concentrate into the hands of one individual, sometimes called pharoah, caesar, czar, kaiser, king, emperor, monarch, sultan, president or communist dictator. No matter what the autocratic leader&#39;s particular title is, the default setting for human government throughout history has most often been monarchy. When power is concentrated, the State is supreme. When power is separated, the individual is supreme. America&#39;s founders had a unique window of opportunity in the long train of world history, to maximize the freedom and opportunity of the individual. Ronald Reagan stated in 1961: &#34;In this country of ours took place the greatest revolution that has ever taken place in the world&#39;s history...Every other revolution simply exchanged one set of rulers for another.&#34; Is past behavior the best indicator of future performance?

Imbued with the artist's love of nature and overflowing with charming details, this spectacular compilation includes such timeless favorites as <i>Old Mother Hubbard, Mary had a little lamb,</i> and <i>Rock-a-bye baby. Sylvia Long's Mother Goose</i> is a perfect gift that, like the rhymes themselves, will be passed from one generation to the next.</p><p><i>"Many adults can look back and see that it was in [Mother Goose] rhymes that they first found a love of language, rhythm and story.... Recited by heart, passed lovingly from parent to child, these verses--magical, musical, sometimes silly, sometimes wise--are part of our collective childhood."</i><p> In her artist's note, Sylvia Long admits that she approached the project of creating a new Mother Goose anthology with some trepidation. The award-winning artist was convinced that the only way she could take on a new version would be if hers were somehow unique. And unique it is. Integrating well-known rhymes with less familiar ones, and altering otherwise frightening images with clever, comforting artwork, Long has come up with a fresh, fun, yet still respectfully traditional approach to these classic verses. Linking the pages visually, Long encourages readers to discover playful connections between different rhymes. For example, the queen in "Pussycat, Pussycat, Where Have You Been?" is seated next to Old King Cole on the opposite page of the spread; apparently, these two are a royal item! Long's love of nature is reflected in her gorgeous watercolors of birds, rabbits, cats, frogs, insects, bears, and mice, all of whom figure prominently as old friends Jack and Jill, Old Mother Hubbard, Little Boy Blue, and Little Robin Red-breast. More than 75 classic Mother Goose rhymes are included in this stunning compendium.

Hats are encouraged but notmandatory.<br><p>It began with my father not wanting to see the Last Rabbit and endedup with my being eaten by a carnivorous plant. It wasn&#x2019;t really whatI&#x2019;d planned for myself&#x2014; I&#x2019;d hoped to marry into the Oxbloods andjoin their dynastic string empire. But that was four days ago, before Imet Jane, retrieved the Caravaggio and explored High Saffron. So insteadof enjoying aspirations of Chromatic advancement, I was wholly immersed within the digestive soup of a yateveo tree. It was all frightfullyinconvenient.</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t all bad, for the following reasons: First, I was lucky tohave landed upside down. I would drown in under a minute, which wasfar, far preferable to being dissolved alive over the space of a few weeks.Second, and more important, I wasn&#x2019;t going to die ignorant. I had discoveredsomething that no amount of merits can buy you: the truth. Notthe whole truth, but a pretty big part of it. And that was why this was allfrightfully inconvenient. I wouldn&#x2019;t get to do anything with it. And thistruth was too big and too terrible to ignore. Still, at least I&#x2019;d held it in myhands for a full hour and understood what it meant.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t set out to discover a truth. I was actually sent to the Outer Fringesto conduct a chair census and learn some humility. But the truth inevitablyfound me, as important truths often do, like a lost thought in need of a mind. I found Jane, too, or perhaps she found me. It doesn&#x2019;t really matter. We foundeach other. And although she was Grey and I was Red, we shared a commonthirst for justice that transcended Chromatic politics. I loved her, and what&#x2019;smore, I was beginning to think that she loved me. After all, she did apologizebefore she pushed me into the leafless expanse below the spread of theyateveo, and she wouldn&#x2019;t have done that if she&#x2019;d felt nothing.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re back here, four days earlier, in the town of Vermillion,the regional hub of Red Sector West. My father and I had arrivedby train the day before and overnighted at the Green Dragon. We hadattended Morning Chant and were now seated for breakfast, disheartenedbut not surprised that the early Greys had already taken the bacon,and it remained only in exquisite odor. We had a few hours before ourtrain and had decided to squeeze in some sightseeing.</p><p>&#x201c;We could always go and see the Last Rabbit,&#x201d; I suggested. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m toldit&#x2019;s unmissable.&#x201d;</p><p>But Dad was not to be easily swayed by the rabbit&#x2019;s uniqueness. Hesaid we&#x2019;d never see the Badly Drawn Map, the Oz Memorial, the colorgarden and the rabbit before our train departed. He also pointed outthat not only did Vermillion&#x2019;s museum have the best collection of Vimtobottles anywhere in the Collective, but on Mondays and Thursdays theydemonstrated a gramophone.</p><p>&#x201c;A fourteen- second clip of &#x2018;Something Got Me Started,&#x2019; &#x201d; he said, as ifsomething vaguely Red- related would swing it.</p><p>But I wasn&#x2019;t quite ready to concede my choice.</p><p>&#x201c;The rabbit&#x2019;s getting pretty old,&#x201d; I persisted, having read the safetybriefing in the &#x201c;How Best to Enjoy Your Rabbit Experience&#x201d; leaflet, &#x201c;andpetting is no longer mandatory.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the petting,&#x201d; said Dad with a shudder, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s the ears. In anyevent,&#x201d; he continued with an air of finality, &#x201c;I can have a productive andfulfilling life having never seen a rabbit.&#x201d;</p><p>This was true, and so could I. It was just that I&#x2019;d promised my bestfriend, Fenton, and five others that I would log the lonely bun&#x2019;s Taxanumber on their behalf and thus allow them to note it as &#x201c;proxy seen&#x201d;in their animal- spotter books. I&#x2019;d even charged them twenty- five centseach for the privilege&#x2014; then blew the lot on licorice for Constance anda new pair of synthetic red shoelaces for me.</p><p>Dad and I bartered like this for a while, and he eventually agreed tovisit all of the town&#x2019;s attractions but in a circular manner, to save on shoeleather. The rabbit came last, after the color garden.</p><p>So, having conceded to at least include the rabbit in the morning&#x2019;s entertainment,Dad returned to his toast, tea and copy of <i>Spectrum </i> as I lookedidly about the shabby breakfast room, seeking inspiration for the postcardI was writing. The Green Dragon dated from before the Epiphany and, likemuch of the Collective, had seen many moments, each of them slightlymore timeworn than the one before. The paint in the room was peeling,the plaster molding was dry and crumbly, the linoleum tabletops wereworn to the canvas and the cutlery was either bent, broken or missing.</p><p>But the hot smell of toast, coffee and bacon, the flippant affability of thestaff and the noisy chatter of strangers enjoying transient acquaintancegave the establishment a peculiar charm that the reserved, eminentlyrespectable tearooms back home in Jade- under- Lime could never match.I noticed also that despite the lack of any Rules regarding seat plans in&#x201c; non- hue- specific&#x201d; venues, the guests had unconsciously divided theroom along strictly Chromatic lines. The one Ultraviolet was respectfullygiven a table all to himself, and several Greys stood at the door waitingpatiently for an empty table even though there were places available.We were sharing our table with a Green couple. They were of matureyears and wealthy enough to wear artificially green clothes so thatall could witness their enthusiastic devotion to their hue, a proudfullyexpensive and tastelessly ostentatious display that was doubtlessfinanced by the sale of their child allocation. Our clothes were dyed ina conventional shade visible only to other Reds, so to the Greens sittingopposite we had only our Red Spots to set us apart from the Greys, andwere equally despised. When they say red and green are complementary,it doesn&#x2019;t mean we like each other. In fact, the only thing that Reds andGreens can truly agree on is that we dislike Yellows more.</p><p>&#x201c;You,&#x201d; said the Green woman, pointing her spoon at me in an exceptionallyrude manner, &#x201c;fetch me some marmalade.&#x201d;</p><p>I dutifully complied. The Green woman&#x2019;s bossy attitude was not atypical.We were three notches lower in the Chromatic scale, which officiallymeant we were subservient. But although lower in the Order, we werestill Prime within the long- established Red- Yellow- Blue Color Model,and a Red would always have a place in the village Council, somethingthe Greens, with their bastard Blue- Yellow status could never do. It irritatedthem wonderfully. Unlike the dopey Oranges, who accepted theirlot with a cheery, self- effacing good humor, Greens never managed torise above the feeling that no one took them seriously enough. The reasonfor this was simple: They had the color of the natural world almost exclusively to themselves, and felt that the scope of their sight- gift shouldreflect their importance within the Collective. Only the Blues could evenbegin to compete with this uneven share of the Spectrum, as they ownedthe sky, but this was a claim based mainly on surface area rather than avariety of shades, and when it was overcast, they didn&#x2019;t even have that.</p><p>But if I thought she was ordering me about solely due to my hue, I wasmistaken. I was wearing a NEEDS HUMILITY badge below my Red Spot. It relatedto an incident with the head prefect&#x2019;s son, and I was compelled to wear itfor a week. If the Green woman had been more reasonable, she would haveexcused me the errand due to the prestigious 1,000 MERITS badge that I alsowore. Perhaps she didn&#x2019;t care. Perhaps she just wanted the marmalade.I fetched the jar from the sideboard, gave it to the Green, noddedrespectfully, then returned to the postcard I was writing. It was of Vermillion&#x2019;sold stone bridge and had been given a light blue wash in thesky for five cents extra. I could have paid ten and had one with greenedgrass, too, but this was for my potential fianc�e, Constance Oxblood, andshe considered overcolorization somewhat vulgar. The Oxbloods werestrictly old- color and preferred muted tones of paint wherever possible,even though they could have afforded to decorate their house to thehighest chroma. Actually, much to them was vulgar, and that includedthe Russetts, whom they regarded as nouveau couleur. Hence my status as&#x201c;potential fianc�.&#x201d; Dad had negotiated what we called a &#x201c;half promise,&#x201d;which meant I was first- optioned to Constance. The agreement fell shortof being reciprocal, but it was a good deal&#x2014; a concession that, despitebeing a Russett and three generations from Grey, I might be able to see agoodly amount of red, so couldn&#x2019;t be ignored completely.</p><p>&#x201c;Writing to Fish- face already?&#x201d; asked my father with a smile. &#x201c;Hermemory&#x2019;s not that bad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; I conceded, &#x201c;but despite her name, constancy is possibly herleast well- defined attribute.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah. Roger Maroon still sniffing about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As flies to stinkwort. And you mustn&#x2019;t call her Fish- face.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;More butter,&#x201d; remarked the Green woman, &#x201c;and don&#x2019;t dawdle thistime.&#x201d;</p><br><p>We finished breakfast and, after some last- minute packing, descendedto the reception desk, where Dad instructed the porter to have our suitcasesdelivered to the station.</p><p>&#x201c;Beautiful day,&#x201d; said the manager as we paid the bill. He was a thin man with a finely shaped nose and one ear. The loss of an ear was not unusual,as they could be torn off annoyingly easily, but what was unusual wasthat he&#x2019;d not troubled to have it stitched back on, a relatively straightforwardprocedure. More interesting, he wore his Blue Spot high up on hislapel. It was an unofficial but broadly accepted signal that he knew howto &#x201c;fix&#x201d; things, for a fee. We&#x2019;d had crayfish for dinner the night before,and he hadn&#x2019;t punched it out of ration books. It had cost us an extra halfmerit, covertly wrapped in a napkin.</p><p>&#x201c;Every day is a beautiful day,&#x201d; replied my father in a cheery manner.</p><p>&#x201c;Indeed they are,&#x201d; the manager countered genially. After we hadexchanged feedback&#x2014; on the hotel for being clean and moderately comfortable,and on us, for not bringing shame to the establishment by poortable manners or talking loudly in public areas&#x2014; he asked, &#x201c;Do youtravel far this morning?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to East Carmine.&#x201d;</p><p>The Blue&#x2019;s manner changed abruptly. He gave us an odd look, handedback our merit books and wished us a joyously uneventful future beforeswiftly moving to attend someone else. So we tipped the porter, reiteratedthe time of our train and headed off to the first item on our itinerary.</p><br><p>&#x201c;Hmm,&#x201d; said my father, staring at the Badly Drawn Map once we haddonated our ten cents and shuffled inside the shabby yet clean maphouse,</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t make head nor tail of this.&#x201d;</p><p>The Badly Drawn Map might not have been very exciting, but it wasvery well named. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s probably why it survived the deFacting,&#x201d; I suggested,for the map was not only mystifying but mind- numbingly rare.</p><p>Aside from the Parker Brothers&#x2019; celebrated geochromatic view of the PreviousWorld, it was the only pre- Epiphanic map known. But somehowits rarity wasn&#x2019;t enough to make it interesting, and we stared blankly forsome minutes at the faded parchment, hoping to either misunderstandit on a deeper level or at least get our money&#x2019;s worth.</p><p>&#x201c;The longer and harder we look at it, the cheaper the entrance donationbecomes,&#x201d; Dad explained.</p><p>I thought of asking how long we&#x2019;d have to stare at it before they owedus money, but didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>He put his guidebook away, and we walked back out into the warmsunlight. We felt cheated out of our ten cents but politely left positivefeedback, since the drabness of the exhibit was no fault of the curator&#x2019;s.</p><p>&#x201c;Dad?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why was the hotel manager so dismissive of East Carmine?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Outer Fringes have a reputation for being unsociably dynamic,&#x201d;he said after giving my question some thought, &#x201c;and some consider thateventfulness may lead to progressive thought, with all the attendantrisks that might bring to the Stasis.&#x201d;</p><p>It was a diplomatically prescient remark, and one that I had cause toconsider a lot over the coming days.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;but what do you think?&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>&#x201c;I think we should go and see the Oz Memorial. Even if it&#x2019;s as dullas magnolia, it will still be a thousand times more interesting than theBadly Drawn Map.&#x201d;</p><br><p>We walked along the noisy streets toward the museum and soaked in thehustle, bustle, dust and heat of Vermillion. All about us were the traders whodealt with daily requisites: livestock herders, barrow boys, water sellers, piemen,storytellers and weight guessers. Catering for more long- term needswere the small shops, such as repairers, artifact dealers, spoon traders andcalculating shops that offered addition and subtraction while you waited.Moderators and loopholists were hirable by the minute to advise on mattersregarding the Rules, and there was even a shop that traded solely in floaties,and another that specialized in postcode genealogy. Amid it all I noticed astronger- than- usual presence of Yellows, presumably to keep an eye out forillegal color exchange, seed trading or running with a sharp implement.</p><p>Unusually for a regional hub, Vermillion was positioned pretty muchon the edge of the civilized world. Beyond it to the east were only theRedstone Mountains and isolated outposts like East Carmine. In theuninhabited zone there would be wild outland, megafauna, lost villagesof untapped scrap color and quite possibly bands of nomadic Riffraff.It was exciting and worrying all in one, and until the week before, Ihadn&#x2019;t even heard of East Carmine, let alone thought I would be spendinga month there on Humility Realignment. My friends were horrified,expressed low- to- moderate outrage that I should be treated this way andproclaimed that they would have started a petition if they could havetroubled themselves to look for a pencil.</p><p>&#x201c;The Fringes are the place of the slack- willed, slack- jawed andslack- hued,&#x201d; remarked Floyd Pinken, who could comfortably boast allthree of those attributes, if truth be known.</p><p>&#x201c;And be wary of losers, self- abusers, fence leapers and fornicators,&#x201d;added Tarquin, who, given his family history, would not have seemedout of place there either.</p><p>They then informed me that I would be demonstrably insane to leavethe safety of the village boundary for even one second, and that a trip tothe Fringes would have me eating with my fingers, slouching and withhair below the collar in under a week. I almost decided to buy my wayout of the assignment with a loan from my twice- widowed aunt Beryl,but Constance Oxblood thought otherwise.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing a what?&#x201d; she asked when I mentioned the reason I wasgoing to East Carmine.</p><p>&#x201c;A chair census, my poppet,&#x201d; I explained. &#x201c;Head Office is worriedthat the chair density might have dropped below the proscribed 1.8 perperson.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How absolutely thrilling. Does an ottoman count as a chair or a verystiff cushion?&#x201d;</p><p>She went on to say that I would be showing significant daring andcommendable bravery if I went, so I changed my mind. With the prospectof joining the family of Oxblood and of myself as potential prefectmaterial, I was going to need the broadening that travel and furniturecounting would doubtless bring, and a month in the intolerably unsophisticatedOuter Fringes might well supply that for me.</p><br><p>The Oz Memorial trumped the Badly Drawn Map in that it wa...</p></p><h2>Millard Fillmore: Biography of a President</h2><p><b>Harry S.

Archetypes, which Carl Jung defined as &#x201c;patterns of behavior,&#x201d; have emerged out of the core of human experience&#x2014;the Mother and the Victim, the Lover and the Actor, the Warrior and the Servant.<br>In CHAKRAS AND THEIR ARCHETYPES, Wauters shows that creating healthy archetypes is both liberating and fundamental to our well-being. In relating the archetypes to the chakras, she guides us on a journey to understand where our energy is blocked and which attitudes or emotional issues are responsible. Using a variety of exercises, meditations, and affirmations, she helps us to free ourselves from the negative archetypes, enabling us to rise to higher levels of awareness and empowerment&#x2014;where we can transcend limitations, make healthy choices, release creativity, heal our pasts, and live with joy, vitality, and love.</p><p>AMBIKA WAUTERS, RSHom, is a homeopath, psychotherapist, and healer and the founder and director of the Institute for Life Energy Medicine.

She gave the man who slid in beside her a small smile and looked out the window, ignoring the way her heart wanted to accelerate. It was always this moment, when she was so close to her goal, when her body wanted to betray her. She never let it. Never. She was very, very good at staying in control. Breathing. Keeping her heart rate perfect, adrenaline at bay.<br><br> The car moved forward, and her head went up alertly. "Wait. I need my interpreter. She always travels with me."<br><br> The car kept moving. The man beside her, Heng Zhang, turned his head and gave her a small, polite smile. "Miss Hightower, you do not need an interpreter. I speak English."<br><br> "I'm aware that you do, Mr. Zhang, but I require my own interpreter. I made that very clear to Mr. Cheng when he invited me. I was given assurances when I agreed to speak with his people. I've turned down his request four times, and will do so this time as well if you don't stop this car immediately, turn it around and get her."<br><br> She kept her voice smooth and even. She had a certain reputation to uphold. She never lost her temper. She never raised her voice. She was always polite. She cut people down sweetly, so sweetly they almost didn't realize at first that she was telling them off. She was an expert at that as well. Seeing as how she was considered one of the world's leading minds in the field of artificial intelligence, those around her should expect that she could hold her own with anyone, but they always took one look at her and judged on appearances. Like now. Zhang made the mistake of looking her up and down and giving her a look that said she was nothing in his eyes before turning away from her and looking out the window.<br><br> In her head, she went through the moves that would end his life and then the driver's. She would use one hard-edged chop to the throat, hard enough to drive through the trachea. Or she could just scratch his arm accidentally. Smile and apologize. Then, when he slumped on the seat, for good measure she could follow up by taking his gun and shooting the driver in the back of the head, shooting Zhang to be certain and then taking control of the car. One, maybe two seconds was all she'd need.<br><br> Zara sat very still, appearing as she always did. She looked like a beautiful model with her long legs, oval face, flawless skin, large slate blue eyes and long red gold hair that fell down her back, thick and unusual, sheets of it falling below her waist, looks that most reporters ended up commenting on when they should be listening to what she had to say. Still, her looks enabled her to get her work done. She shouldn't complain. It was her looks that often kept her alive.<br><br> She turned her head and looked out the window, resisting the impulse to kill Zhang for his smug, superior attitude. They probably had a camera on her. She let her mind drift, uncaring of the direction they were taking her. She knew where Cheng's lair was. He was famous in the district, his building a fortress. The government tolerated him because he paid them well and gave them all sorts of reasons to keep him protected. Cheng bought and sold secrets and shared them often enough with the government to buy their protection.<br><br> Once at the facility, the car pulled into the underground parking garage, went through three guard stations and pulled right up to a private elevator. Zhang got out first and went around to her door. For a split second, Zara debated whether or not to have it out with them right there in the parking lot by refusing to move from the car. She knew they would force her, but she also knew they wouldn't kill her.<br><br> Cheng needed her. He wanted the information she had. He had kept doubling the price each time she refused to come to his private facility to give her talk on the VALUE system, as she called her project, and its uses in the business world. He thought he had bought her with his more than generous offer, the one that would set her up for life if she accepted it-or get her killed.<br><br> She slid out of the car without looking left or right, and followed Zhang into the elevator. Neither spoke as they were whisked up to the middle floor where Cheng waited for her. She was stopped as she stepped off. Two guards with automatic weapons took her briefcase and pointed to a door. She stepped through it into a narrow cubicle. Immediately her entire body was scanned for listening devices, weapons and cameras, anything that might harm Cheng in any way.<br><br> Zara knew Cheng was paranoid, and deservedly so. He had his hand in every criminal activity around the globe that had to do with running guns, drugs or political secrets. He had top minds working for him developing all kinds of weapons that he sold on the black market. What he didn't develop, he stole. She knew every paper in her briefcase would be scanned and copied before it was returned to her. She'd come prepared for just such a thing. Those papers were "encrypted." No one could break the code because there wasn't one. In reality, the code was nothing but sheer gibberish, but it would give Cheng's people something to keep them busy.<br><br> She was taken from the cubicle and marched through an open floor where there were several desks leading the way to Cheng's office. He stood in the doorway, all smiles, as if she should be pleased to meet him even though he'd broken their rules.<br><br> "Miss Hightower, how good of you to come," he greeted.<br><br> She stopped moving a few feet from his office, forcing Zhang and the two guards to stop as well. "My interpreter?" She didn't smile. She kept her gaze fixed on Cheng without blinking, something she'd practiced for a long time. She was very good at it.<br><br> "I'm sorry." Cheng didn't sound in the least remorseful. "You must understand I have many enemies. I don't, as a rule, allow any outsider into these facilities. There are always industrial spies. We won't need an interpreter."<br><br> Stubbornly she didn't move an inch. "Don't you think you should have let me know you changed the conditions? I'm uncomfortable without her. When I come to Shanghai, I always use her and have grown used to her."<br><br> Cheng stepped back to clear his doorway, waving toward his office. "Please come in, Miss Hightower. My staff has made you tea, which I believe is your favorite drink."<br><br> She stood for several seconds, letting them all worry. Zhang stepped close to her. "Miss Hightower." He waved toward the office.<br><br> She looked at him coolly. Haughtily. Every bit as arrogant as his boss. "I'm deciding. I added this additional talk to my agenda, and as you both are aware, I've had a very tight and exhausting schedule. I did this as a courtesy. I don't need the money. To have your boss break his word so quickly is disconcerting to say the least."<br><br> Zhang switched instantly to his native language. "Do you want me to take her up to the interrogation room? Bolan Zhu can extract the information you require from her."<br><br> Cheng shook his head, a small, humorless smile on his mouth, one that reminded Zara of a cold-blooded reptile. "Don't be so bloodthirsty, Heng. She will cooperate."<br><br> "I apologize again, Miss Hightower."<br><br> "I dislike others speaking in a language I can't understand," Zara said, still not moving. She had understood every word they said. Her resume never stated that she was gifted in languages. That was kept a secret for instances just like this one. She admitted to knowing a few pertinent words in the languages of countries she traveled to often, but was careful not to let on that she understood without her interpreter. Her heart had jumped at the name Bolan Zhu. He was extremely good at torturing people.<br><br> "Zhang was only asking after your comfort. We knew you would have trouble without your interpreter, so we tried to think of other ways that would assure you would enjoy your visit with us," Cheng lied smoothly. "We thought a tour of our labs was in order. Understand, this is a great privilege, one not extended often."<br><br> As in never. A tendril of unease slid through her. He wanted her evaluation. She understood that. He wanted to hear what she was doing in her chosen field of expertise. She understood that too. She had the feeling that seeing his labs, especially his computers, the ones that stored all that data, the secrets he blackmailed or paid others to get so he could sell out countries-including his own-to the highest bidder, would earn her a bullet in the brain.<br><br> She kept her eyes steady on Cheng's face. Zhang didn't matter. He would carry out his boss's orders, but he wouldn't act on his own. He didn't take her as a threat.<br><br> "Miss Hightower, I realize the circumstances are unusual, but if you would just come into my office and hear me out, I would appreciate it."<br><br> She felt Zhang stiffen beside her. He didn't like his boss asking. He was used to the man ordering others and if they didn't obey, punishment was swift and brutal. The fact that she was a woman and an American probably offended him even more. Deliberately she made certain to stand as tall as possible so she could tower over Zhang. He was particularly short, and she knew it irritated him that she was tall. Cheng was the same height as she was in her heels.<br><br> Zara flashed Cheng a small smile and walked past him into the spacious office. She took the chair he indicated and sank into it, deliberately crossing her legs. Zhang didn't like her, but he appreciated her looks. Doing the leg thing always kept others from thinking she was brilliant. She'd found out that most people didn't think looks and brains could go hand in hand.<br><br> Cheng seated himself across from her, not behind his desk, clearly trying to create a much friendlier atmosphere. He picked up a file and scanned it quickly. "This is very impressive. I see you went to MIT as an undergrad and then got your PhD at Stanford in Computer Science. Your subfield is machine learning?"<br><br> He made it a question, but Zara didn't respond. Instead she looked slightly bored. She was really good at that particular look as well. She'd perfected that and the wide-eyed innocent look she was certain she was going to need very soon.<br><br> "I see you teach at Rutgers University. Why not private business? You could make a lot more money."<br><br> She shrugged. "Money bores me. I realize it makes the world go around, but I don't spend much time in the real world, Mr. Cheng. My mind prefers other pursuits." Which she supposed was the strict truth. She didn't think about money because she didn't have to. She thought about other things like life and death. Like survival. "I spend most of my time working on things others don't understand, and that's all right. My programs, hopefully, will be a contribution to the world."<br><br> "There isn't a lot here about your earlier life."<br><br> She frowned at him. "What does my earlier life have to do with my work?" She kept her voice mild, as if barely interested. She kept her heartbeat the exact same rhythm, and that took just a little extra work, but she knew it was possible her vitals were being monitored just by her sitting in the chair he'd chosen for her.<br><br> "I like to know everything about anyone I do business with."<br><br> "I'm not a businesswoman, Mr. Cheng. I lecture. I get paid to lecture. I give talks on exciting new breakthroughs in the world of artificial intelligence. That's what I thought you wanted from me, and knowing anything other than my credentials is not really helpful. I can assure you, my credentials speak for me. I'm regarded as one of the leading experts in AI and machine learning. I thought you were aware of that."<br><br> "I'm very aware of that, Miss Hightower," Cheng assured. "It's just that you're far younger than I thought you'd be. I noted your age, of course, but thought it was a typo."<br><br> His gaze flicked several times to Zhang, and more than ever she was certain they were somehow determining if she was lying or not. She liked cat-and-mouse games. She was good at them. She was fairly certain his secretary, or whoever prepared the report on her, wouldn't dare give him a report with a typo. His secretary wouldn't survive the hour.<br><br> "My age does sometimes give people pause, but I graduated with honors, I assure you," she said with a small shrug as if she didn't care whether he believed her or not. She uncrossed her legs to switch them, drawing their attention immediately. Once comfortable, she moved her foot, clad in a sexy blue high heel to match the blue jacket she wore, around in lazy circles. That always seemed to mesmerize males. It worked with Zhang, but not with Cheng.<br><br> "You disappear for long periods of time."<br><br> He made it a statement so she smiled sweetly at him as if waiting for a question, making him ask.<br><br> He sighed. "Where do you go?"<br><br> She shook her head. "I don't really think what I do in my downtime is any of your business."<br><br> "You're more of a consulting professor for Rutgers. I want to know where you go, Miss Hightower. You're asking me to trust you around my researchers."<br><br> She stopped the lazy circles, planted both feet solidly on the floor and leaned toward him. "Let's get something straight, Mr. Cheng. I'm doing you the favor, not the other way around. I said no over and over. I made it clear I wasn't interested in your money. You may think I agreed to speak to your people because the money was too good to pass up, but it was because you intrigued me. You were that persistent. I thought the research mattered to you. If you keep insisting on playing this silly game, I would very much like you to ask your driver to return me to my hotel."<br><br> "Have I offended you with my questions?"<br><br> Zhang interrupted, once again in his language. "Let me take her to the interrogation room, Mr. Cheng."<br><br> "That's it." Zara stood up, glaring at Zhang. "I can't believe how rude you're being when you invited me here.

Now Graham is ready to tell his story: his lower-class childhood in post-war England, his early days in the British Invasion group The Hollies; becoming the lover and muse of Joni Mitchell during the halcyon years, when both produced their most introspective and important work; meeting Stephen Stills and David Crosby and reaching superstardom with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young; and his enduring career as a solo musician and political activist.&nbsp; Nash has valuable insights into a world and time many think they know from the outside but few have experienced at its epicenter, and equally wonderful anecdotes about the people around him: the Beatles, the Stones, Hendrix, Cass Elliot, Dylan, and other rock luminaries. From London to Laurel Canyon and beyond, <i>Wild Tales</i> is a revealing look back at an extraordinary life&#x2014;with all the highs and the lows; the love, the sex, and the jealousy; the politics; the drugs; the insanity&#x2014;and the sanity&#x2014;of a magical era of music.</p></p><p><p>GRAHAM NASH is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee&#x2014;once with CSN and once with The Hollies.&nbsp; He was also inducted into the Songwriter&#x2019;s Hall of Fame twice&#x2014;both as a solo artist and with CSN. And, he is a Grammy award winner. In 2010, Nash was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth for his contributions as a musician and philanthropist.&nbsp;An activist for social and environmental justice, he is also an artist, acclaimed photographer and photography collector. His company Nash Editions&#x2019; original IRIS 3047 digital printer lives in the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution in recognition revolutionary accomplishments in the fine arts digital printing world.&nbsp;He lives in Hawaii with his wife, Susan.</p>chapter1<br><br>August 1968<br><br>It always comes down to the music.<br><br>I had a tune running through my head as my flight touched down a few minutes late at LAX. All my life I&#x2019;ve had music in my head, but that night the tune (the theme from the TV series 77 Sunset Strip) was doing battle on my behalf, helping me fend off the other shit that was rattling around in there. For the past few months, my well-ordered world had been turned upside down, and throughout the long flight from London everything seemed to gang up on me. There was no escaping it in that crowded cabin. With few distractions, I&#x2019;d taken stock of the difficult choices on my holy mess of a plate.<br><br>How&#x2019;s this for starters: I was contemplating leaving my country, my marriage, my bank account, and my band&#x2014;all at once! Any one of those would have been enough to put a grown man in the hole, but I was close to running the table.<br><br>My band, the Hollies, and I had come to an impasse. We had grown up together, spent many years making music, writing songs, drinking and larking about; we&#x2019;d had a fantastic string of hits, incredible success&#x2014;but from where I stood we were growing apart. I&#x2019;d moved on, I was headed in an exciting new direction, and my heart and soul weren&#x2019;t in the Hollies anymore.<br><br>The same with my marriage. My wife, Rosie, and I had been drifting for some time. We both knew things were coming to an end. In fact, for the last six months, we&#x2019;d started seeing other people. Now she was off in Spain chasing another man, and I was on my way to Los Angeles to visit a woman who had captured my heart.<br><br>I was also in love with LA and the States. I&#x2019;d known it from the moment I first set foot on American soil. It was the Promised Land, and I was drenched in the Hollywood scene&#x2014;the music, the sun, the palm trees, the attitude, the looseness. The way people there asked me, &#x201c;What do you think?&#x201d; In England, nobody ever asked your opinion of anything. You learned to keep your business to yourself, to mind your p&#x2019;s and q&#x2019;s. In America it seemed like there were no rules, everything was up for grabs, and I loved the freedom of it. I wanted all of it for myself.<br><br>No doubt about it, my life had gotten complicated. I was at a hell of a crossroads. There were plenty of unanswered questions. My plight became more apparent as I got off the plane and headed to the taxi stand. There was no point stopping for baggage. I had my guitar, that was it, that was all I had come with. Nothing else mattered. I was in America. I was going to see my new girlfriend, to be with Joni.<br><br>The sun had just left the western sky as the cab crawled up Laurel Canyon, bathing the Hollywood Hills in the golden flush of summer. I got a great vibe every time I came up here. Only a few minutes from the madness of the Strip, but a world apart. There was a shabby hippie chicness to it, with crazy little houses on stilts teetering along each side of the twisty-turny road. It was a place where there were free-spirited people just like me doing the things that I wanted to do, being creative and making music. I felt the pull of Laurel Canyon, its community spirit. Man, it looked like home to me.<br><br>We stopped in front of a small wooden house on Lookout Mountain Avenue. It wasn&#x2019;t a posh affair, just a one-bedroom bungalow, a little jewelbox, with a sloping shingled roof and a lovely garden out back on a lick of land. A tiny tree had taken root near the porch. A green VW van was parked by a mailbox at the curb. Inside, lights glowed brightly and I could hear the jingle-jangle of voices rising in unison. I knew she had company; I&#x2019;d called her from the airport. And I knew who was with her. Still, I hesitated, fearing to intrude. I leaned on my guitar case and considered again where I was and what I was doing. Deep down, I was still a kid from the north of England, a place that continued to leave its mark on me. Sure, I know, I was an English rock star, I had it made. But my past made me feel that I wasn&#x2019;t cool, that maybe, even now, I was out of my element. Ahhh&#x2014;what the hell? I&#x2019;d been in all kinds of situations the past ten years. No point in getting hung up on that now.<br><br>Suddenly, Joni was at the door and nothing else mattered. It had been a few months since we&#x2019;d last seen each other&#x2014;and that was, in fact, the first time we&#x2019;d met&#x2014;but our connection was instant. Joni Mitchell was the whole package: a lovely, sylphlike woman with a natural blush, like windburn, and an elusive quality that seemed lit from within. Her beauty was almost as big a gift as her talent, and I&#x2019;d been pulled into her orbit, captivated from the get-go.<br><br>Behind her, sitting at the dining room table, two men I&#x2019;d expected to see were finishing dinner. I grinned the moment I laid eyes on them.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Willy!&#x201d; David Crosby called from across the room, using a nickname reserved for my closest friends. He was one of those incredible guys it was impossible not to like, a gregarious character, irreverent as hell, with a gorgeous voice and a great sense of humor. I&#x2019;d met him almost two years earlier, when he was still a member of the Byrds, and we&#x2019;d become fast friends. There was something that just clicked when we were together. We were on the same wavelength. We loved the same music and the same kind of women, including Joni, who&#x2019;d been a lover of his some months back. Croz was a no-bullshit kind of guy who called things as he saw them. Besides, he always had the best dope in LA&#x2014;maybe the best dope anywhere.<br><br>The guy next to him was Stephen Stills, an amazing guitar player who was in Buffalo Springfield, one of the primo LA bands. We&#x2019;d gotten to know each other a little the last time I&#x2019;d been in the States. He was already something of an underground legend, a guy who played and held his own with Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix, totally unique, with a slew of incredible songs. Together, Stills and Crosby were a powerful combination. They had great chops, and I could tell from things they said that they had something cooking.<br><br>Seeing them put me totally at ease. Plus Joni really loved them. Stephen had played on her first album, which David had produced. They were all great friends, really comfortable in each other&#x2019;s company, and were eager to roll me into their circle.<br><br>Crosby had been smokin&#x2019; it before I got there and was reasonably high, so I had some catching up to do. They must have been making some music, too, because guitars were lying all over the place, which I&#x2019;d come to learn was par for the course. In that Laurel Canyon scene, people always brought their guitars to dinner. They took their guitars everywhere; it was part of who they were. And at some point, someone would always say, &#x201c;Get a load of this new song I&#x2019;m working on.&#x201d; You could set your watch by it, never failed.<br><br>I hadn&#x2019;t been there a half hour when David whacked Stephen on the arm and said, &#x201c;Hey, play Willy that song we were just doing.&#x201d; Stephen, who was sunk into an armchair next to a giant antique pig from a carousel, uncurled and grabbed his guitar. He fingerpicked a few bars of a beautiful intro while David walked over next to him and joined him in the verse. &#x201c;In the morning, when you rise / do you think of me and how you left me crying . . .&#x201d; Their harmonies were gorgeous, airtight, two-part&#x2014;Stephen on the melody with David underneath&#x2014;that rivaled the Everly Brothers. &#x201c;Are you thinking of telephones / and managers and where you got to be at noon?&#x201d; I was blown away. The song, &#x201c;You Don&#x2019;t Have to Cry,&#x201d; was a killer, and their voices double-killed it. You hear something like that, you know it&#x2019;s special right away. The words and tune were perfectly pitched.<br><br>They got to the end and I said, &#x201c;Fuck, that&#x2019;s a fabulous song! Man, Stephen, you wrote a beauty.&#x201d; I glanced at Joan, who was sitting by the piano, and flashed her a smile before asking them: &#x201c;Would you mind doing it again?&#x201d;<br><br>They looked at each other, shrugged, and said, &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>The next time around I really concentrated on the lyric and the way their voices intertwined and shadowed each other. Hearing them individually, you&#x2019;d think they&#x2019;d sideswipe each other. David&#x2019;s tenor was polished to a high gloss, while Stephen&#x2019;s voice was husky and less disciplined, influenced by bluesy southern roots rock. Somehow they didn&#x2019;t compete so much as complement. And they had a natural vibrato, which cast a haunting shade. Those cats could sing.<br><br>But so could I.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, bear with me here,&#x201d; I said when they finished. &#x201c;Do it one more time.&#x201d;<br><br>Three times, the same song. They must have thought I was stoned out of my gourd. But I was English and a guest, they figured let&#x2019;s amuse this guy. Now, I&#x2019;m a quick study, so I already knew the words and had the harmony down. I&#x2019;d been listening to it internally and thinking: I know what to do, I know where to go, I got it&#x2014;I got it. As Stephen launched into the intro again, I casually made my way over, standing to his left, and when they hit the opening line&#x2014;I&#x2019;m there. I had my breath down, the phrasing, the tuning. I put my harmony above Stephen, and off we sailed. You are livvvv-ing, a reality / I left years ago and it quite nearly killed me. In the lonnnng run . . . What a sound! We were locked in, tight as a drum. Flawless three-part harmony. It sounded so soft and beautiful, so incredible that a minute or so into the song we collapsed in laughter. Especially when we hit that chorus. It was insane!<br><br>&#x201c;Wow! Wait a second. What the fuck was that?&#x201d;<br><br>The three of us were harmony freaks and came from groups that had refined two-part as an art: the Hollies, the Springfield, and the Byrds. But the sound we&#x2019;d just made was different, so fresh. We had never heard anything like it before. It was the Everly Brothers plus. And yet so simple: just one acoustic guitar and three people singing as one.<br><br>It shocked David and Stephen. I&#x2019;m not sure they&#x2019;d ever thought about the song in three parts. But I&#x2019;d heard it right away.<br><br>Crosby was beaming ear to ear. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the best thing I ever heard!&#x201d; he said.<br><br>I asked Joni: &#x201c;Did that sound as incredible to you as it did to me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, it sounded pretty incredible.&#x201d;<br><br>Something magical had happened, and we all knew it. When you sing with two or three people and you get it right&#x2014;when the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts&#x2014;everything kind of lifts a couple feet off the ground. The three of us were levitating, all right. The vibe was so high, it was hard to touch down. There was an intense joy that we had found something new, an original sound different from anything that was out there. It was there, complete, a minute into our relationship. We all felt it, knew it. We wanted it for ourselves. But we were reluctant to discuss how to pull it off. It was almost as if we were afraid to talk about it, to let the secret out in case it wasn&#x2019;t there tomorrow morning.<br><br>Besides, there were so many roadblocks in our paths. To sing with these guys I would have to sever my ties with the Hollies&#x2014;not such an easy thing to do. For one thing, they were my mates; I loved those guys. Allan Clarke and I had been joined at the hip since we were six years old, and I was an integral part of the group. I&#x2019;d have to get out of my record contract, get my publishing rights back. It was a mess, but it could be done. Stephen had to figure out how to extricate himself from Buffalo Springfield.<br><br>&#x201c;We have to make this work,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>I nodded. &#x201c;We have no fucking choice but to make this work.&#x201d; There was no doubt in my mind. The moment I heard that sound I knew the rest of my life was headed in another direction. No two ways about it. I had no choice.<br><br>Eventually the guys left and, frankly, I was happy to see them go. I only had three days to spend with Joan, to get to know her intimately, and there are some things that even music doesn&#x2019;t trump. Nor did I see them the rest of the weekend. I was just with Joan; let&#x2019;s get real. But I couldn&#x2019;t get that sound out of my mind. I was haunted by those voices, the way they&#x2019;d blended so naturally. And those guys. And their songs.<br><br>On the flight back to London, I was more fidgety than ever. Not confused: I knew now what was in my heart. I had fallen deeply in love with Joni Mitchell. I was a goner in that department. And those two rascals, Stills and Crosby, were messing with my head. Maybe I had fallen for them, as well.<br><br>Everything in my world was spinning, colliding, but I knew what I had to do. There was no doubt in my entire body. And by the time the plane touched down I had it all figured out. I was going home to untangle the first twenty-six years of my life, and to tie up loose ends for the next however many decades. I had heard the future in the power of those voices. And I knew my life would never be the same.<br><br>chapter2<br><br>In 1996, I found myself in Blackpool of all places, a kind of run-down seaside resort where workers from northern England ventured for relaxation, and where I happened to be spending some precious downtime. My two sons, Jackson and Will, were with me, and one hazy afternoon as we strolled down New South Promenade, I detoured into a joint called the Kimberley Hotel, whose two-and-a-half-star Trip Advisor rating kind of says it all. At the front desk, the porter on duty looked up from a magazine he was reading as we hovered into sight.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen, I have a really strange question,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>He waved a hand to cut me off. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s around the corner. You go down two stairs and turn left.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said, with something less than tact, &#x201c;but how do you know what I&#x2019;m about to say?&#x201d;</p><h2>Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications</h2><p><b>The ultimate guide to cryptography, updated from an author team of the world's top cryptography experts.</b> <p>Cryptography is vital to keeping information safe, in an era when the formula to do so becomes more and more challenging.

Gabrielle is an enchanting heroine.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;The State</i> (Columbia, S.C.)</b><br><br> <b>&#x201c;A compelling historical romance.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><p>Julie Garwood is the author of numerous New York Times bestsellers, including Shadow Dance, Slow Burn, Murder List, Killjoy, Mercy, Heartbreaker, Ransom, and Come the Spring. There are more than thirty-two million copies of her books in print.One <br><br>Wellingshire, England <br><br>Princess Gabrielle was barely six years old when she was summoned to her mother&#x2019;s deathbed. Escorting her was her faithful guard, two soldiers on either side, their gait slow so she could keep up with them as they solemnly made their way down the long corridor. The only sound was their boots clicking against the cold stone floor.<br><br>Gabrielle had been called to her mother&#x2019;s deathbed so many times she&#x2019;d lost count.<br><br>As she walked, she kept her head bowed, staring intently at the shiny rock she&#x2019;d found. Mother was going to love it. It was black with a tiny white streak zigzagging all around it. One side was as smooth as her mother&#x2019;s hand when she stroked the side of Gabrielle&#x2019;s face. The rock&#x2019;s other side was as rough as her papa&#x2019;s whiskers.<br><br>Every day at sunset Gabrielle brought her mother a different treasure. Two days ago she&#x2019;d captured a butterfly. It had such pretty wings, gold with purple splotches. Mother declared it was the most beautiful butterfly she&#x2019;d ever seen. She praised Gabrielle for being so gentle with one of God&#x2019;s creatures as she walked to the window and let it fly away.<br><br>Yesterday Gabrielle had gathered flowers from the hill outside the castle walls. The scent of heather and honey had surrounded her, and she thought the lovely aroma even more pleasing than her mother&#x2019;s special oils and perfumes. Gabrielle had tied a pretty ribbon around the stems and tried to fashion a nice bow, but she didn&#x2019;t know how and she&#x2019;d made a mess of it. The ribbon had come undone before she handed the bouquet to her mother.<br><br>Rocks were Mother&#x2019;s favorite treasures. She kept a basketful that Gabrielle had collected for her on a table next to her bed, and she would love this rock most of all.<br><br>Gabrielle wasn&#x2019;t worried about today&#x2019;s visit. Her mother had promised that she wouldn&#x2019;t go away to heaven any time soon, and she never broke her promises.<br><br>The sun cast shadows along the stone walls and floor. If Gabrielle hadn&#x2019;t been on an errand with her rock, she would have liked to chase the shadows and try to capture one. The long corridor was one of her favorite places to play. She loved to hop on one foot from one stone to another and see how far she could get before falling. She hadn&#x2019;t made it to the second arched window yet, and there were five more windows to go.<br><br>Sometimes she closed her eyes, stretched her arms out wide, and spun and spun until she lost her balance and tumbled to the floor, so dizzy the walls seemed to fly about her head.<br><br>Most of all, she loved to run down the corridor, especially when her father was home. He was such a big, grand man, taller than any of the pillars in the church. Her papa would call to her and wait until she reached him. Then he scooped her up into his arms and lifted her high above his head. If they were in the courtyard, she raised her hands to the sky, certain she could almost touch a cloud. Papa always pretended to lose his grip so that she would think he was about to drop her. She knew he never would, but she squealed with delight over the possibility. She wrapped her arms around his neck and held tight as he strode toward her mother&#x2019;s rooms. When he was in an especially happy mood he would sing. Papa had a terrible singing voice, and sometimes Gabrielle giggled and covered her ears it was so awful, but she never really laughed. She didn&#x2019;t want to hurt his tender feelings.<br><br>Papa wasn&#x2019;t at home today. He had left Wellingshire to visit his uncle Morgan in northern England, and he wouldn&#x2019;t be home for several days. Gabrielle wasn&#x2019;t concerned. Mother wouldn&#x2019;t die without him by her side.<br><br>Stephen, the leader of the guards, opened the door to her mother&#x2019;s chamber and coaxed Gabrielle to enter by giving her a gentle little nudge between her shoulder blades. &#x201c;Go on, Princess,&#x201d; he urged.<br><br>She turned around with a disgruntled frown. &#x201c;Papa says you&#x2019;re to call my mama Princess Genevieve, and you&#x2019;re supposed to call me Lady Gabrielle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Here in England, you are Lady Gabrielle,&#x201d; He tapped the crest emblazoned on his tunic, &#x201c;But in St. Biel, you are our princess. Now go, your mother is waiting.&#x201d;<br><br>Seeing Gabrielle, her mother called out. Her voice was weak, and she looked terribly pale. For as long as Gabrielle could remember, her mother had stayed in bed. Her legs had forgotten how to walk, she&#x2019;d explained to Gabrielle, but she was hopeful, praying that they would one day remember. If that miracle were to happen, she promised Gabrielle that she would stand barefoot in the clear stream to gather stones with her daughter.<br><br>And she would dance with Papa, too.<br><br>The chamber was crowded with people. They made a narrow path for her. The priest, Father Gartner, was chanting his prayer in a low whisper near the alcove, and the royal physician, who always frowned and liked to make her mother bleed with his black, slimy bugs, was also in attendance. Gabrielle was thankful he hadn&#x2019;t put any bugs on her mother&#x2019;s arms today.<br><br>The maids, the stewards, and the housekeeper hovered beside the bed. Mother put down her tapestry and needle, shooed the servants away, and motioned to Gabrielle.<br><br>&#x201c;Come and sit with me,&#x201d; she ordered.<br><br>Gabrielle ran across the room, climbed up onto the platform, and thrust the rock at her mother.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s beautiful,&#x201d; she whispered as she took the rock and carefully examined it. &#x201c;This is the best one yet,&#x201d; she added with a nod.<br><br>&#x201c;Mother, you say that every time I bring you a rock. It&#x2019;s always the best one.&#x201d;<br><br>Her mother patted a spot next to her. Gabrielle scooted closer and said, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t die today. Remember? You promised.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I remember.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Papa will be awful angry, too, so you better not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lean closer, Gabrielle,&#x201d; her mother said. &#x201c;I have need to whisper.&#x201d;<br><br>The sparkle in her eyes told Gabrielle she was playing her game again.<br><br>&#x201c;A secret? Are you going to tell me a secret?&#x201d;<br><br>The crowd moved forward. All were eager to hear what she would say.<br><br>Gabrielle looked around the room. &#x201c;Mother, why are all these people here? Why?&#x201d;<br><br>Her mother kissed her cheek. &#x201c;They think that I know where a great treasure is hidden, and they hope that I will tell you where it is.&#x201d;<br><br>Gabrielle giggled. She liked this game. &#x201c;Are you going to tell me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not today,&#x201d; she answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Not today,&#x201d; Gabrielle repeated so that the curious onlookers would hear.<br><br>Her mother struggled to sit up. The housekeeper rushed forward to place pillows behind her back. A moment later the physician announced that her color was improving.<br><br>&#x201c;I am feeling much better,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Leave us now,&#x201d; she ordered, her voice growing stronger with each word. &#x201c;I would like a moment alone with my daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>The physician looked as though he wanted to protest, but he kept silent as he ushered the group from the chamber. He motioned for two maids to stay behind. The women waited by the door to do their mistress&#x2019;s bidding.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you feeling so much better you can tell me a story today?&#x201d; Gabrielle asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Which story would you like to hear?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The princess story,&#x201d; she eagerly answered.<br><br>Her mother wasn&#x2019;t surprised. Gabrielle always asked for the same story.<br><br>&#x201c;There once was a princess who lived in a faraway land called St. Biel,&#x201d; her mother began. &#x201c;Her home was a magnificent white castle high on the top of a mountain. Her uncle was the king. He was very kind to the princess, and she was very happy.&#x201d;<br><br>When her mother paused, Gabrielle blurted impatiently, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the princess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gabrielle, you know that I am and that this story is about your father and me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, but I like to hear you tell it.&#x201d;<br><br>Her mother continued. &#x201c;When the princess was of age, a bargain was struck with Baron Geoffrey of Wellingshire. The princess was to marry the baron and live with him in England.&#x201d;<br><br>Because she knew that her daughter loved to hear about the wedding ceremony, the gowns, and the music, she went into great detail. The little girl clapped her hands with delight when she heard about the banquet feast, especially the description of the fruit tarts and honey cakes. By the end of the story, the mother&#x2019;s narrative had become slow and labored. Exhaustion was catching up with her. The little girl took notice and, as was her ritual, she again made her mother promise she wouldn&#x2019;t die today.<br><br>&#x201c;I promise. Now it is your turn to tell me the story I taught you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Every word just like you taught me, Mother? And just like your mother taught you?&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled. &#x201c;Every word. And you will remember it and tell your daughters one day so they will know of their family and St. Biel.&#x201d;<br><br>Gabrielle grew solemn and closed her eyes to concentrate. She knew she must not forget a word of the story. This was her heritage, and her mother assured her that one day she would understand what that meant. She folded her hands in her lap and then opened her eyes again. Focusing on her mother&#x2019;s encouraging smile, she began.<br><br>&#x201c;Once upon a time in the year of the violent storms that tore in from the sea . . .&#x201d;</p><h2>Fair Land, Fair Land</h2><p>With his revered classics The Big Sky and The Way West, A. B. Guthrie, Jr., claimed his preeminent post as the father of the western epic. Fair Land, Fair Land, first published in 1982, marks the sequel to his two masterworks and rounds out a chronological gap, the mid-nineteenth century, in Guthrie&#39;s Big Sky series. Reappearing here is Dick Summers, of the earlier sagas, now a wizened conservationist who seeks retribution from his former compatriot Boone Caudill and renewed companionship with the self-reliant Teal Eye. Imbued with a rich sense for the impermanence of the idyllic plains, this tour de force offers a stirring commentary on a country&#39;s physical and spiritual erosion, as relevant today as it was a decade ago.</p><p>A. B. Guthrie, Jr. (1901&#x2013;1991), was the author of numerous books, including six Big Sky novels, as well as the Academy Award&#x2013;winning screenplay for the classic film Shane. He received the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for his novel The Way West. Guthrie was honored for his contribution to literature and his portrayal of the American West.Who says the West isn't wild any more? This duo by Guthrie follow on the boot heels of two recent Max Brand reprints (Classic Returns, 10/15/95), perhaps triggering a resurgence of interest in the genre. LJ's reviewer found Fair Land, a sequel to Guthrie's Big Sky and The Way West, "not only an authentic portrayal of the Old West but also a good novel with full-bodied characters and a spare, though picturesque, style" (LJ 9/1/82). The Thousand Hills, however, was deemed "far below the author's usual high standard" (LJ 11/15/56).

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy.

It haunts the popular imagination as an extreme faith that promotes terrorism, authoritarian government, female oppression, and civil war. In a vital revision of this narrow view of Islam and a distillation of years of thinking and writing about the subject, Karen Armstrong&#x2019;s short history demonstrates that the world&#x2019;s fastest-growing faith is a much more complex phenomenon than its modern fundamentalist strain might suggest.</p><p>The picture of Islam as a violent, backward, and insular tradition should be laid to rest, says Karen Armstrong, bestselling author of <i>Muhammad</i> and <i>A History of God</i>. Delving deep into Islamic history, Armstrong sketches the arc of a story that begins with the stirring of revelation in an Arab businessman named Muhammad. His concern with the poor who were being left behind in the blush of his society's new prosperity sets the tone for the tale of a culture that values community as a manifestation of God. Muhammad's ideas catch fire, quickly blossoming into a political empire. As the empire expands and the once fractured Arabs subdue and overtake the vast Persian domain, the story of a community becomes a panoramic drama. With great dexterity, Armstrong narrates the Sunni-Shi'ite schism, the rise of Persian influence, the clashes with Western crusaders and Mongolian conquerors, and the spiritual explorations that traced the route to God. Armstrong brings us through the debacle of European colonialism right up to the present day, putting Islamic fundamentalism into context as part of a worldwide phenomenon. <i>Islam: A Short History</i>, like Bruce Lawrence's <i>Shattering the Myth</i> and Mark Huband's <i>Warriors of the Prophet</i>, introduces us to a faith that beckons like a minaret to those who dare to venture beyond the headlines. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>&#x201c;A small gem bristling with insight.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>&#x201c;A valuable corrective to the hostile caricatures of Islam that circulate in the English-speaking world. . . .

Armstrong, one of our most prominent religious scholars, examines how these traditions began in response to the violence of their time. Studying figures as diverse as the Buddha and Socrates, Confucius and Jeremiah, Armstrong reveals how these still enduring philosophies can help address our contemporary problems.</p></p><p><p>Karen Armstrong is the author of numerous books on religion, including&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Case for God, A History of God, The Battle for God, Holy War, Islam, Buddha</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Fields of Bloos</i>, as well as a memoir,&nbsp;<i>The Spiral Staircase</i>.

The Aryans were not a distinct ethnic group, so this was not a racial term but an assertion of pride and meant something like &#x201c;noble&#x201d; or &#x201c;honorable.&#x201d; The Aryans were a loose-knit network of tribes who shared a common culture. Because they spoke a language that would form the basis of several Asiatic and European tongues, they are also called Indo-Europeans. They had lived on the Caucasian steppes since about 4500, but by the middle of the third millennium some tribes began to roam farther and farther afield, until they reached what is now Greece, Italy, Scandinavia, and Germany. At the same time, those Aryans who had remained behind on the steppes gradually drifted apart and became two separate peoples, speaking different forms of the original Indo-European. One used the Avestan dialect, the other an early form of Sanskrit. They were able to maintain contact, however, because at this stage their languages were still very similar, and until about 1500 they continued to live peacefully together, sharing the same cultural and religious traditions.<br><br>It was a quiet, sedentary existence. The Aryans could not travel far, because the horse had not yet been domesticated, so their horizons were bounded by the steppes. They farmed their land, herded their sheep, goats, and pigs, and valued stability and continuity. They were not a warlike people, since, apart from a few skirmishes with one another or with rival groups, they had no enemies and no ambition to conquer new territory. Their religion was simple and peaceful. Like other ancient peoples, the Aryans experienced an invisible force within themselves and in everything that they saw, heard, and touched. Storms, winds, trees, and rivers were not impersonal, mindless phenomena. The Aryans felt an affinity with them, and revered them as divine. Humans, deities, animals, plants, and the forces of nature were all manifestations of the same divine &#x201c;spirit,&#x201d; which the Avestans called <i>mainyu</i> and the Sanskrit-speakers <i>manya</i>. It animated, sustained, and bound them all together.<br><br>Over time the Aryans developed a more formal pantheon. At a very early stage, they had worshiped a Sky God called Dyaus Pitr, creator of the world. But like other High Gods, Dyaus was so remote that he was eventually replaced by more accessible gods, who were wholly identified with natural and cosmic forces. Varuna preserved the order of the universe; Mithra was the god of storm, thunder, and life-giving rain; Mazda, lord of justice and wisdom, was linked with the sun and stars; and Indra, a divine warrior, had fought a three-headed dragon called Vritra and brought order out of chaos. Fire, which was crucial to civilized society, was also a god and the Aryans called him Agni. Agni was not simply the divine patron of fire; he was the fire that burned in every single hearth. Even the hallucinogenic plant that inspired the Aryan poets was a god, called Haoma in Avestan and Soma in Sanskrit: he was a divine priest who protected the people from famine and looked after their cattle.<br><br>The Avestan Aryans called their gods <i>daevas</i> (&#x201c;the shining ones&#x201d;) and <i>amesha</i> (&#x201c;the immortals&#x201d;). In Sanskrit these terms became <i>devas</i> and <i>amrita</i>. None of these divine beings, however, were what we usually call &#x201c;gods&#x201d; today. They were not omnipotent and had no ultimate control over the cosmos. Like human beings and all the natural forces, they had to submit to the sacred order that held the universe together. Thanks to this order, the seasons succeeded one another in due course, the rain fell at the right times, and the crops grew each year in the appointed month. The Avestan Aryans called this order <i>asha</i>, while the Sanskrit-speakers called it<i> rita</i>. It made life possible, keeping everything in its proper place and defining what was true and correct.<br><br>Human society also depended upon this sacred order. People had to make firm, binding agreements about grazing rights, the herding of cattle, marriage, and the exchange of goods. Translated into social terms, <i>asha</i>/<i>rita</i> meant loyalty, truth, and respect, the ideals embodied by Varuna, the guardian of order, and Mithra, his assistant. These gods supervised all covenant agreements that were sealed by a solemn oath. The Aryans took the spoken word very seriously. Like all other phenomena, speech was a god, a <i>deva</i>. Aryan religion was not very visual. As far as we know, the Aryans did not make effigies of their gods. Instead, they found that the act of listening brought them close to the sacred. Quite apart from its meaning, the very sound of a chant was holy; even a single syllable could encapsulate the divine. Similarly, a vow, once uttered, was eternally binding, and a lie was absolutely evil because it perverted the holy power inherent in the spoken word. The Aryans would never lose this passion for absolute truthfulness.<br><br>Every day, the Aryans offered sacrifices to their gods to replenish the energies they expended in maintaining world order. Some of these rites were very simple. The sacrificer would throw a handful of grain, curds, or fuel into the fire to nourish Agni, or pound the stalks of soma, offer the pulp to the water goddesses, and make a sacred drink. The Aryans also sacrificed cattle. They did not grow enough crops for their needs, so killing was a tragic necessity, but the Aryans ate only meat that had been ritually and humanely slaughtered. When a beast was ceremonially given to the gods, its spirit was not extinguished but returned to Geush Urvan (&#x201c;Soul of the Bull&#x201d;), the archetypical domestic animal. The Aryans felt very close to their cattle. It was sinful to eat the flesh of a beast that had not been consecrated in this way, because profane slaughter destroyed it forever, and thus violated the sacred life that made all creatures kin. Again, the Aryans would never entirely lose this profound respect for the &#x201c;spirit&#x201d; that they shared with others, and this would become a crucial principle of their Axial Age.<br><br>To take the life of any being was a fearful act, not to be undertaken lightly, and the sacrificial ritual compelled the Aryans to confront this harsh law of existence. The sacrifice became and would remain the organizing symbol of their culture, by which they explained the world and their society. The Aryans believed that the universe itself had originated in a sacrificial offering. In the beginning, it was said, the gods, working in obedience to the divine order, had brought forth the world in seven stages. First they created the<i> Sky</i>, which was made of stone like a huge round shell; then the <i>Earth</i>, which rested like a flat dish upon the <i>Water</i> that had collected in the base of the shell. In the center of the Earth, the gods placed three living creatures: a <i>Plant</i>, a <i>Bull</i>, and a <i>Man</i>. Finally they produced Agni, the <i>Fire</i>. But at first everything was static and lifeless. It was not until the gods performed a triple sacrifice&#x2014;crushing the Plant, and killing the Bull and the Man&#x2014;that the world became animated. The sun began to move across the sky, seasonal change was established, and the three sacrificial victims brought forth their own kind. Flowers, crops, and trees sprouted from the pulped Plant; animals sprang from the corpse of the Bull; and the carcass of the first Man gave birth to the human race. The Aryans would always see sacrifice as creative. By reflecting on this ritual, they realized that their lives depended upon the death of other creatures. The three archetypal creatures had laid down their lives so that others might live. There could be no progress, materially or spiritually, without self-sacrifice. This too would become one of the principles of the Axial Age.<br><br>The Aryans had no elaborate shrines and temples. Sacrifice was offered in the open air on a small, level piece of land, marked off from the rest of the settlement by a furrow. The seven original creations were all symbolically represented in this arena: Earth in the soil, Water in the vessels, Fire in the hearth; the stone Sky was present in the flint knife, the Plant in the crushed soma stalks, the Bull in the victim, and the first Man in the priest. And the gods, it was thought, were also present. The <i>hotr</i> priest, expert in the liturgical chant, would sing a hymn to summon<i> devas</i> to the feast. When they had entered the sacred arena, the gods sat down on the freshly mown grass strewn around the altar to listen to these hymns of praise. Since the sound of these inspired syllables was itself a god, as the song filled the air and entered their consciousness, the congregation felt surrounded by and infused with divinity. Finally the primordial sacrifice was repeated. The cattle were slain, the soma pressed, and the priest laid the choicest portions of the victims onto the fire, so that Agni could convey them to the land of the gods. The ceremony ended with a holy communion, as priest and participants shared a festal meal with the deities, eating the consecrated meat and drinking the intoxicating soma, which seemed to lift them to another dimension of being.<br><br>The sacrifice brought practical benefits too. It was commissioned by a member of the community, who hoped that those<i> devas</i> who had responded to his invitation and attended the sacrifice would help him in the future. Like any act of hospitality, the ritual placed an obligation on the divinities to respond in kind, and the <i>hotr</i> often reminded them to protect the patron&#x2019;s family, crops, and herd. The sacrifice also enhanced the patron&#x2019;s standing in the community. Like the gods, his human guests were now in his debt, and by providing the cattle for the feast and giving the officiating priests a handsome gift, he had demonstrated that he was a man of substance. The benefits of religion were purely material and this-worldly. People wanted the gods to provide them with cattle, wealth, and security. At first the Aryans had entertained no hope of an afterlife, but by the end of the second millennium, some were beginning to believe that wealthy people who had commissioned a lot of sacrifices would be able to join the gods in paradise after their death.<br><br>This slow, uneventful life came to an end when the Aryans discovered modern technology. In about 1500, they had begun to trade with the more advanced societies south of the Caucasus in Mesopotamia and Armenia. They learned about bronze weaponry from the Armenians and also discovered new methods of transport: first they acquired wooden carts pulled by oxen, and then the war chariot. Once they had learned how to tame the wild horses of the steppes and harness them to their chariots, they discovered the joys of mobility. Life would never be the same again. The Aryans had become warriors. They could now travel long distances at high speed. With their superior weapons, they could conduct lightning raids on neighboring settlements and steal cattle and crops. This was far more thrilling and lucrative than stock breeding. Some of the younger men served as mercenaries in the armies of the southern kingdoms, and became expert in chariot warfare. When they returned to the steppes, they put their new skills to use and started to rustle their neighbors&#x2019; cattle. They killed, plundered, and pillaged, terrorizing the more conservative Aryans, who were bewildered, frightened, and entirely disoriented, feeling that their lives had been turned upside down.<br><br>Violence escalated on the steppes as never before. Even the more traditional tribes, who simply wanted to be left alone, had to learn the new military techniques in order to defend themselves. A heroic age had be-gun. Might was right; chieftains sought gain and glory; and bards celebrated aggression, reckless courage, and military prowess. The old Aryan religion had preached reciprocity, self-sacrifice, and kindness to animals. This was no longer appealing to the cattle rustlers, whose hero was the dynamic Indra, the dragon slayer, who rode in a chariot upon the clouds of heaven. Indra was now the divine model to whom the raiders aspired. &#x201c;Heroes with noble horses, fain for battle, selected warriors call on me in combat,&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;I, bountiful Indra, excite the conflict, I stir the dust, Lord of surpassing vigour!&#x201d; When they fought, killed, and robbed, the Aryan cowboys felt themselves one with Indra and the aggressive <i>devas</i> who had established the world order by force of arms.<br><br>But the more traditional, Avestan-speaking Aryans were appalled by Indra&#x2019;s naked aggression, and began to have doubts about the <i>daevas</i>. Were they all violent and immoral? Events on earth always reflected cosmic events in heaven, so, they reasoned, these terrifying raids must have a divine prototype. The cattle rustlers, who fought under the banner of Indra, must be his earthly counterparts. But who were the <i> daevas</i> attacking in heaven? The most important gods&#x2014;such as Varuna, Mazda, and Mithra, the guardians of orderwere given the honorific title &#x201c;Lord&#x201d; (ahura). Perhaps the peaceful ahuras, who stood for justice, truth, and respect for life and property, were themselves under attack by Indra and the more aggressive daevas? This, at any rate, was the view of a visionary priest, who in about 1200 claimed that Ahura Mazda had commissioned him to restore order to the steppes. His name was Zoroaster.<br><br>When he received his divine vocation, the new prophet was about thirty years old and strongly rooted in the Aryan faith. He had probably studied for the priesthood since he was seven years old, and was so steeped in tradition that he could improvise sacred chants to the gods during the sacrifice. But Zoroaster was deeply disturbed by the cattle raids, and after completing his education, he had spent some time in consultation with other priests, and had meditated on the rituals to find a solution to the problem. One morning, while he was celebrating the spring festival, Zoroaster had risen at dawn and walked down to the river to collect water for the daily sacrifice. Wading in, he immersed himself in the pure element, and when he emerged, saw a shining being standing on the riv-erbank, who told Zoroaster that his name was Vohu Manah (&#x201c;Good Purpose&#x201d;). Once he had been assured of Zoroaster&#x2019;s own good intentions, he led him into the presence of the greatest of the ahuras: Mazda, lord of wisdom and justice, who was surrounded by his retinue of seven radiant gods. He told Zoroaster to mobilize his people in a holy war against terror and violence. The story is bright with the promise of a new beginning. A fresh era had dawned: everybody had to make a decision, gods and humans alike. Were they on the side of order or evil?</p><h2>Petrus Romanus: The Final Pope Is Here</h2><p>For more than 800 years scholars have pointed to the dark augury having to do with &#34;the last Pope.&#34; The prophecy, taken from St. Malachy&#39;s &#34;Prophecy of the Popes,&#34; is among a list of verses predicting each of the Roman Catholic popes from Pope Celestine II to the final pope, &#34;Peter the Roman,&#34; whose reign would end in the destruction of Rome. First published in 1595, the prophecies were attributed to St. Malachy by a Benedictine historian named Arnold de Wyon, who recorded them in his book, Lignum Vit�. Tradition holds that Malachy had been called to Rome by Pope Innocent II, and while there, he experienced the vision of the future popes, including the last one, which he wrote down in a series of cryptic phrases. According to the prophecy, the next pope (following Benedict XVI) is to be the final pontiff, Petrus Romanus or Peter the Roman. The idea by some Catholics that the next pope on St. Malachy&#39;s list heralds the beginning of &#34;great apostasy&#34; followed by &#34;great tribulation&#34; sets the stage for the imminent unfolding of apocalyptic events, something many non-Catholics would agree with. This would give rise to a false prophet, who according to the book of Revelation leads the world&#39;s religious communities into embracing a political leader known as Antichrist. In recent history, several Catholic priests--some deceased now--have been surprisingly outspoken on what they have seen as this inevitable danger rising from within the ranks of Catholicism as a result of secret satanic &#34;Illuminati-Masonic&#34; influences. These priests claim secret knowledge of an multinational power elite and occult hierarchy operating behind supranatural and global political machinations. Among this secret society are sinister false Catholic infiltrators who understand that, as the Roman Catholic Church represents one-sixth of the world&#39;s population and over half of all Christians, it is indispensable for controlling future global elements in matters of church and state and the fulfillment of a diabolical plan they call &#34;Alta Vendita,&#34; which is set to assume control of the papacy and to help the False Prophet deceive the world&#39;s faithful (including Catholics) into worshipping Antichrist. As stated by Dr. Michael Lake on the front cover, Catholic and evangelical scholars have dreaded this moment for centuries. Unfortunately, as readers will learn, time for avoiding Peter the Roman just ran out.</p><p><i>" The Enthronement of the Fallen Archangel Lucifer was effected within the Roman Catholic Citadel on June 29, 1963; a fitting date for the historic promise about to be fulfilled. As the principal agents of this Ceremonial well knew, Satanist tradition had long predicted that the Time of the Prince would be ushered in at the moment when a Pope would take the name of the Apostle Paul [Pope Paul VI]. That requirement--the signal that the Availing Time had begun--had been accomplished just eight days before with the election of the latest Peter-in-the-Line."</i> <b>-Jesuit Priest, Father Malachi Martin</b> <br><br>For more than 800 hundred years Catholic and Evangelical scholars have pointed to the dark augury having to do with "the last Pope." The prophecy, taken from St. Malachy's "Prophecy of the Popes," is among a list of verses predicting each of the Roman Catholic popes from Pope Celestine II to the final pope, "Peter the Roman," whose reign heralds the beginning of "great apostasy" followed by "great tribulation." According to this prophecy, which was hidden away in the Vatican for hundreds of years, the next Pope (following Pope Benedict XVI) will be the false prophet who leads the world's religious communities into embracing the political leader known as Antichrist.

The book contrasts the thought of Aquinas with popular views, such as moral relativism, values clarification, utilitarianism, Kantian deontology, and situation ethics. Following the Socratic dictum "know thyself," Steven J. Jensen investigates the interior workings of the human mind, revealing the interplay of reason, will, and emotions. According to Aquinas, in a healthy ethical life, reason guides the emotions and will to the true human good. In an unhealthy life, emotional impulses distort the vision of reason, entrapping one in futile pursuits. In the human struggle to gain self-mastery, a person must overcome the capricious desires that enslave him to false goods.</p><p>Jensen ably guides readers through Aquinas's philosophy and explains the distinction between the moral and intellectual virtues. The moral virtues train our various desires toward the true good, helping us discard our misguided cravings and teaching us to enjoy what is truly worth pursuing. The virtue of justice directs our hearts to the good of others, freeing us from egoism in order to seek a good shared with others. The intellectual virtues train the mind toward the truth, so that we can find fulfillment in human understanding. Most important, the virtue of prudence directs our deliberations to discover the true path of<br>life.</p><p>Intended as a text for students, beginners of philosophy will gain access to a key aspect of Aquinas's thought, namely, that true happiness is realized not in the animal life of passion and greed but only in the reasonable pursuit of human goods, in which we find true peace and rest from the distractions of this world.</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p><p>Steven J.

Or, 'How can I get my people more engaged in safety?' You might think you can solve your safety problems by telling your people to be more careful, by reprimanding the miscreants, by issuing a new rule or procedure and demanding compliance. These are all expressions of 'The Bad Apple Theory' where you believe your system is basically safe if it were not for those few unreliable people in it. Building on its successful predecessors, the third edition of The Field Guide to Understanding &#x2019;Human Error&#x2019; will help you understand a new way of dealing with a perceived 'human error' problem in your organization. It will help you trace how your organization juggles inherent trade-offs between safety and other pressures and expectations, suggesting that you are not the custodian of an already safe system. It will encourage you to start looking more closely at the performance that others may still call 'human error', allowing you to discover how your people create safety through practice, at all levels of your organization, mostly successfully, under the pressure of resource constraints and multiple conflicting goals. The Field Guide to Understanding 'Human Error' will help you understand how to move beyond 'human error'; how to understand accidents; how to do better investigations; how to understand and improve your safety work. You will be invited to think creatively and differently about the safety issues you and your organization face. In each, you will find possibilities for a new language, for different concepts, and for new leverage points to influence your own thinking and practice, as well as that of your colleagues and organization. If you are faced with a &#x2019;human error&#x2019; problem, abandon the fallacy of a quick fix. Read this book.</p><p>Sidney Dekker (PhD Ohio State University, USA, 1996) is currently professor at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, where he runs the Safety Science Innovation Lab. He is also Professor (Hon.) of psychology at The University of Queensland, and Professor (Hon.) of human factors and patient safety at the Royal Children&#39;s Hospital in Brisbane. Previously, Sidney was Professor of human factors and system safety at Lund University in Sweden. After becoming full professor, he learned to fly the Boeing 737, working part-time as an airline pilot out of Copenhagen. Sidney is the best-selling author of a multitude of human factors and safety books, including, most recently, Safety Differently (2014), Second Victim (2013), Just Culture (2012), Drift into Failure (2011), and Patient Safety (2011).It's in the world's best interest to read Dekkers book. The Field Guide is nothing short of a paradigm shift in thinking about human error, and in my domain of software and Internet engineering, it should be considered required reading. This Third Edition is much better than the Second, and the layout of the material is far more accessible. <br>John Allspaw, SVP, Infrastructure and Operations, Etsy<br><br>If you design equipment or operating procedures, if you investigate accidents or deal with safety, this is an essential book. Sidney Dekker, a leading world authority on human error; has enhanced his already exceptional Field Guide; to be a concise, readable guide to both design of equipment and procedures and also the analysis of mishaps. The label human error; is misleading and its use prevents discovery and correction of the true underlying causes of incidents. So read about hindsight bias, about the difference between the view from inside the system rather than from outside, and about difference between the blunt end (where you should do your work) and the sharp end (where people tend to focus). Read, learn, and put these ideas into practice. The results will be fewer incidents, less damage, less injury. --Don Norman, author of The Design of Everyday Things<br><br>The Third Edition of Sidney Dekker's Field Guide to Understanding Human Error provides a solid practical framework for anyone wanting to make sense of safety science, human factors analysis, and the New View approach to conducting investigations of incidents and accidents. The trademark direct and passionate style that is common in Dekker's work focuses on the circumstances of frontline operators and managers working in complex systems, as well as the challenges of the safety investigator. Dekker does not mince his words; Any human factors investigation that does not take goal conflicts seriously does not take human work seriously and is clearly supportive both of sharp end workers, who are tasked with creating safety in the face of resource constraints in complex systems, as well as the investigators, charged with making sense of events that often seem surprising and unpredictable. Several new topics are introduced and enrich the earlier versions of the Field Guide - for instance the chapter on creating a safety department presents important principles for those with the courage to take on such a daunting task. This will be an invaluable resource for any organization serious about understanding and improving the safety of their operations. --Dr Robert Robson, Principal Advisor, Healthcare System Safety and Accountability, Inc.<br><br>When things go wrong in organisations, one thing is almost always found in the post-mortem: human error (in various guises). But one only needs to scratch the surface of system failures to understand that things are not so straightforward. What seems to make sense as a causal catch-all for our everyday slips and blunders snaps when stretched; it fails to explain the context and complexity of our work and systems. There is a better way. In this important book, Sidney Dekker conveys a practical approach for life after human error . It is both humanistic and systemic; it treats people holistically and non-judgementally, while considering system conditions and dynamics in context. If you are prepared to suspend your own preconceptions and reactions to failure this book will repay you with a practical, highly readable and deeply humane approach to dealing with failure. --Steven Shorrock, European Safety Culture Program Leader, EUROCONTROL</p><h2>Guitar Chord Bible: Over 500 Illustrated Chords for Rock, Blues, Soul, Country, Jazz, and Classical (Volume 8) (Music Bibles, 8)</h2><p>Over 500 illustrated chords are covered for Rock, Blues, Soul, Country, Jazz and Classical music.

Depressed college student Dylan attempts suicide only to be spared by a demon with the offer of a bargain-kill someone once a month or face death yourself. Dylan soon decides to start targeting criminals overlooked by the system and becomes strangely successful in his violent endeavors. His personal affairs improve, and it seems for the first time he's living the life he's always wanted-which is exactly when the repercussions of his actions start catching up to him. Brubaker's talent for plotting, dialog, and exploring the darkest corners of the human heart is wonderfully complemented by Phillips's skill at depicting both drama and larger-than-life violence.

McManus's gently comic stories about outdoor life have earned him millions of fans worldwide. With <i>Kerplunk!</i>, McManus delivers a collection of folksy, wonderfully wise depictions of country life worthy of Mark Twain.<br><br>In these tall tales, McManus and his buddies learn how not to net a fish, why you should never get your hair cut by someone who's mad at you, what to do when a deer wanders into camp but your sleeping bag has frozen shut, and how to avoid bird-dog flatulence.<br> <br> Traveling the highways and byways of the Pacific Northwest, the delightful backcountry characters of <i>Kerplunk!</i> understand how a life of hunting and fishing -- and its inherent potential for misadventure -- can resonate with larger meaning. McManus's characters know exactly why it costs $500 to make a fly lure that retails for $2; why installing a boat trailer hookup can lead to divorce; and, most important, why you should always listen for the sound of your fishing line hitting the water -- because in life as it is in fishing, you don't know you're in the water until you hear the kerplunk!<br> <br> These wry, curmudgeonly tales appeal to real outdoorsmen and the armchair variety alike. Often nostalgic, occasionally philosophical, and always funny, the stories in <i>Kerplunk!</i> reaffirm Patrick F. McManus's reputation as an American classic.</p><p>Patrick F.

His most recent Sheriff Bo Tully mysteries are <i>The Double-Jack Murders</i> and <i>Avalanche</i>.

As often happened in those days, a spontaneous card party had erupted at the main ranch house one Sunday afternoon, and it was decided by the rancher that everyone should stay for dinner that evening. The fact that the ranch larder had little on hand to feed twenty or so people bothered the rancher not at all. He simply turned to one of the older boys and ordered, "Biff, go catch us some fish for supper."</p><p>To my mind, this was about the same as ordering up a miracle: "Biff, go to the moon and back before supper." My own father, a member of the card party, probably reacted to the order about the same as I did. Dad didn't put on any airs that he was some kind of sportsman, but catching a fish for him was about equal in difficulty to working out the mathematics for Einstein's theory of relativity. (I inherited my father's genes for both mathematics and fishing.)</p><p>Although Biff didn't seem particularly pleased with this assignment, he turned to me and said, "C'mon, Pat, I'll show you how to catch fish."</p><p>It must have been in the spring of the year, March or April, because I recall great, greasy masses of frog eggs in pools of water scattered about the meadow through which the creek meandered. I never did see the actual creek, because it was bordered on both sides by brush considerably higher than Biff's head.</p><p>The fish-catching apparatus apparently was well established at the ranch. Biff stopped by one of the barns and scooped large handfuls of worms out of a box of soil. He put the worms in a rusty can and the can in an old milk bucket. Then we headed out into the watery meadow. Biff hadn't bothered with a fishing rod, and I soon discovered why.</p><p>Leaning up against the brush along the creek every ten yards or so was a slender, peeled tamarack pole. Each was about ten feet long. A line ran from the tip to the butt. A heavy lead sinker was attached to the line. A sturdy leader ran from the line to the hook. The hook was neatly tucked into the butt of the pole. (Please note that I do not dignify these contraptions by referring to them as "rods.")</p><p>Biff undid a hook and placed a bit of worm on it. He then whipped the pole around in a rather graceful arc and sent hook, line, and sinker flying over the brush. (This action was much more difficult to accomplish than it seemed, as I was shortly to find out.) It was then that I received my first bit of fishing advice.</p><p>"Always listen for the kerplunk," Biff said.</p><p>"The kerplunk?" I said.</p><p>"Yeah," he said. "<i>Kerplunk</i> is the sound your sinker makes hitting the water. If you don't hear the kerplunk, your hook may be sitting on a log or hung up on the brush. Your line's not even in the water."</p><p>I have remembered that bit of fishing advice all my life and follow it even to this day whenever I am in a situation that requires me to hurl a baited hook over a wall of brush. Indeed, it is good advice for everyday life: Always listen for the kerplunk. Otherwise, your line may not even be in the water.</p><p>As I recall, the catching of the fish that day was rather tedious and miserable, the weather being wet and cold. Biff baited the hook on each pole, and then whipped the line over the brush. We then walked back to the beginning of the row of poles -- I think there were eight or ten of them -- and, reversing his maneuver of sending the line out over the brush, he brought it back, with a fish looping through the air and plopping on the ground behind us. Most of the trout we caught seemed to run to the small side, about eight inches or so. (Good, though!) Biff dropped each in the bucket as he caught it. Within an hour and a half we had in the bucket what in those days was described quite accurately as "one heck of a mess of fish." Still, I doubt we were over our combined limit, because the limit for trout back then was twenty-one per fisherman. So we would have been perfectly legal, provided Biff had had a license.</p><p>I think the unofficial limit back then was "all you can catch plus one fish," but even so it was unusual for anyone to reach even the official limit. To say you caught your limit meant something in those days. It usually meant you were lying.</p><p>I remember only one fellow back then who practiced catch-and-release. He was eventually nabbed, I think, and placed in an institution.</p><p>Biff also gave me my second piece of fishing advice: Use a strong leader. I doubt his own leaders could have been used to tow a logging truck out of a mud hole, but they would have served well for most jobs short of that. As I mentioned earlier, I found casting a line over the wall of brush to be much harder than it looked. Several times I cast over the brush and didn't hear the kerplunk on the other side. On these occasions Biff would drag the log or stump or branch or whatever the hook had become attached to back over the brush. Also, I don't recall ever losing a fish because a leader snapped off. So always remember to use a strong leader, particularly if you're fishing with a tamarack pole.</p><p>I started fishing with flies when I was about ten. Later I would learn there is nothing that attracts unwanted advice so voluminously as fly-fishing, but back then my fishing buddy, one Vern Schulze, didn't know any more about fly-fishing than I did.</p><p>If Vern caught a fish, I'd ask him, "What are you using?"</p><p>"A big old gray thing with white wings," he'd reply.</p><p>"Good," I'd say. "I've got one of those."</p><p>There were two flies we actually knew the names of: Black Gnat and Royal Coachman. If someone asked us what our favorite fly was, however, we'd almost always say Royal Coachman, because that sounded so much better than Black Gnat. Neither of us ever caught a fish on the Royal Coachman. Apparently, the fish in our part of the country had never seen a bug that looked even remotely like a Royal Coachman.</p><p>All of our flies were big, too: #10s, and even #8s and #6s. You needed hooks that big in order to get a really strong leader to fit through the eyes. But we seldom lost a fly. Oh, sure, sometimes, when we had to drag a stump or log out of a creek, but it was better than losing a fly.</p><p>I've fished with Vern for more than half a century, and I don't think he has even once given me a bit of advice on how to catch fish. He always catches more fish than I do, so maybe it's just that he doesn't want to reveal any of his secrets.</p><p>Our method of fly-fishing was, first, get the fly in the water. That's it, there's nothing else: Get the fly in the water. If the fly isn't in the water, it isn't going to catch a fish. Even though I have two whole library shelves devoted to fly-fishing, the entirety of my fly-fishing technique, after all these years, consists of nothing more than getting the fly in the water. This fact raises great consternation among my fly-fishing friends and guides. They cannot help but shout advice to me, occasionally with the emphasis of very bad fourteen-letter words. "Keep your rod tip up!" they shout. "Keep the rod tip down! Keep that fish away from the boat! Don't let it get under the boat! Put some goop on your line! Put some goop on your fly! Cast over there! Cast over here! Pump! Pump! Mend your line!"</p><p>My fly casting has been compared by a guide to having the exact same motions as those of an old lady fighting off a bee with a broom handle. I thought that was particularly cruel. One guide even complained that he was afraid my casting was going to upset the boat. Yeah, well, anyone who puts a 5-weight line on a 7-weight rod will cast like that. Try it yourself.</p><p>My response to most of the advice and criticism hurled at my fishing technique is to smile and nod, as though I have just absorbed some great truth. Then I will turn and say, very soberly, "But remember this one thing. Always listen for the kerplunk."</p><p>You see, I know a great many people who have never heard a kerplunk, and therefore never even realize they don't have their line in the water.Copyright � 2007 by Patrick F.

How exactly does it work? And what do three siblings trying to share a cake have to do with it? In <i>How to Bake Pi</i>, math professor Eugenia Cheng provides an accessible introduction to the logic and beauty of mathematics, powered, unexpectedly, by insights from the kitchen. We learn how the bechamel in a lasagna can be a lot like the number five, and why making a good custard proves that math is easy but life is hard. At the heart of it all is Cheng's work on category theory, a cutting-edge "mathematics of mathematics," that is about figuring out how math works.<br>Combined with her infectious enthusiasm for cooking and true zest for life, Cheng's perspective on math is a funny journey through a vast territory no popular book on math has explored before. So, what is math? Let's look for the answer in the kitchen.</p><p><b>Eugenia Cheng</b> is tenured in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sheffield. She is the Scientist in Residence at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where she currently lives."Cheng never quite overeggs her metaphor of the mathematician as chef...and her tone is clear, clever and friendly. Even at her most whimsical she is rigorous and insightful. Potentially confusing ideas are expressed with a matter-of-fact simplicity.... <i>How to Bake Pi</i> is a welcome addition to the popular-math shelf, unusual not only because of its quirky premise but also because Cheng is a woman, a lucid and nimble expositor, and unashamedly proud of her domestic obsessions.... It would be wonderful if this book attracted a new audience to the field. And there's no better ambassador (or dinner-party host, I'd wager) than Eugenia Cheng."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Alex Bellos</b>, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></i></b><br><br>"[A] slyly illuminating dispatch on the deep meaning of mathematics.... Cheng manages to do for us what the mathematician Keith Devlin has said mathematicians do for themselves: she compels us to see numbers and symbols as vivid characters in an ongoing drama, a narrative in which we are alternately observers and participants."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Natalie Angier</b>, <i>The American Scholar</i></i></b><br><br>"[O]ften entertaining...frequently illuminating.... [<i>How to Bake Pi</i>] offers enough nourishment for the brain to chew on for a long time."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Columbus Dispatch</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In her new book, <i>How to Bake Pi</i>, mathematician/baker Eugenia Cheng offers a novel, mathematical approach to cooking.... <i>How to Bake Pi</i> is more than a mathematically-minded cookbook. It is just as much a book about mathematical theory and how we learn it. The premise at the heart of the book is that the problem that stops a cookbook from teaching us how to cook is the same problem that makes math classes so bad at actually teaching us to do math."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Ria Misra</b>, <i>io9</i></i></b><br><br>"Invoking plenty of examples from cooking and baking, as well as other everyday-life situations such as calculating a taxi fare, searching for love through online dating services and training for a marathon, [Cheng] explains abstract mathematical ideas--including topology and logic--in understandable ways.... Her lively, accessible book demonstrates how important and intriguing such a pursuit can be."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Scientific American</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[Cheng's] book, a very gentle introduction to the main ideas of mathematics in general and category theory in particular, exudes enthusiasm for mathematics, teaching, and creative recipes. Category theory is dangerously abstract, but Cheng's writing is down-to-earth and friendly. She's the kind of person you'd want to talk to at a party, whether about math, food, music, or just the weather....

Though these culinary analogies teach readers about particular mathematical principles and processes, they ultimately point toward the fundamental character of mathematics as a system of logic, a system presenting daunting difficulties yet offering rare power to make life easier. Despite her zeal for mathematical logic, Cheng recognizes that such logic begins in faith--irrational faith--and ultimately requires poetry and art to complement its findings. A singular humanization of the mathematical project."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Booklist</b></i>, starred review</i></b><br><br>"Cheng is exceptional at translating the abstract concepts of mathematics into ordinary language, a strength aided by a writing style that showcases the workings of her curious, sometimes whimsical mind.

It is to remedy this situation that Father Dani�lou has written this book. <i>The Bible and the Liturgy</i> illuminates, better than has ever before been done, the vital and meaningful bond between Bible and liturgy. Father Dani�lou aims at bringing clearly before his reader's minds the fact that the Church's liturgical rites and feasts are intended, not only to transmit the grace of the sacraments, but to instruct the faithful in their meaning as well as the meaning of the whole Christian life. It is through the sacraments in their role as signs that we learn. So that their value will be appreciated, Dani�lou attempts to help us rediscover the significance of these rites so that the sacraments may once again be thought of as the prolongation of the great works of God in the Old Testament and the New.</p><p>&#x201c;No serious student of the liturgy, no cleric especially, will want to miss the depths of meaning conveyed by the sacramental signs which this book reveals.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Catholic World</i><br><br> &#x201c;Father Dani�lou shows a life-long, intimate friendship with the early fathers of the church. With an amazing ease and dexterity he will call upon these holy writers to explain the early origin as well as the deeper and more primitive meaning of the sacramental rites. . . . [<i>The Bible and the Liturgy</i>] will provide a much deeper understanding of our principal liturgical rites in themselves and in their relation to the Passion. . . . There is much profit and inspiration in this book, so wonderfully rich in patristic lore.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Passionist</i><br><br> &#x201c;Dani�lou offers us a rich synthesis of the profound meaning of the sacramental rites and feasts. The book is written most properly for a wide public; its contents are intended for the members of God&#x2019;s people who, whether in parishes or cloisters, celebrate the feasts of the Church and take part in her sacraments. It is of high importance for pastoral liturgy and catechetical instruction.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Worship</i><br><br> &#x201c;[T]he book awakens the reader to the depth and dimension and unity that characterize divine activities.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Religious Education</i><br><br> Jean Dani�lou, S.J.

Volume 1</h2><p>Today there are untold voices in print, on television, and online calling for our attention, and so many of these mock or belittle our faith. From coworkers to those calling themselves Christians, the tone has become one of reproach, disparaging the character of God and undermining the authority of the Bible. For those who have a heart for God, it can be intimidating and discouraging. <p> <i>How Do We Know the Bible is True?</i> is based on the absolute authority of Gods Word, not man-centered explanations. Clearly presented, it will help bring clarity in a world filled with increasingly vague notions of truth. Over 20 relevant issues are discussed including: </p><p> </p><ul> <li>Is the Bible totally without error?</li> <li>Did the resurrection really happen?</li> <li>How do we know that the 66 books of the Bible are from God?</li> <li>Does the Bible contradict itself?</li> <li>How were people saved before Jesus came?</li> <li>What is the purpose and meaning of life?</li> <li>Did miracles really happen?</li> <li>Was Genesis derived from ancient myths?</li> <li>How should we interpret the Bible; should Genesis be literal?</li> <li>Do you have to believe in a young earth to be saved?</li> </ul> <p> Within these pages you will find responses to those honest questions of faith, helping to build a confidence in God s Word and inspiring your daily walk in His grace and peace.

She'll leave it closed in wintry mists, and as cold as they'</i></p><p>On 5th November 1831, Anne Lister began settling into a new apartment overlooking the sea at 15 Pelham Crescent in Hastings. Assisted by her '<i>noodle</i>' of a servant, Cameron, she started by unpacking some of her extensive library of books, among them Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein</i>, de la Beches's <i>Geology</i>, Dr Scudamore's <i>Observations on Pulmonary Consumption</i> and Edward Gibbon's <i>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>.<br> It was a rainy, blustery day, and Anne was pleased to discover a comforting piece of Yorkshire Parkin in her packing box. Choosing to ignore the fact that, judging by its label, the cake was intended for her manservant George Playforth, she shared it with Miss Vere Hobart, who along with her servant, Norbury, was busy unpacking her things in the bedroom across the landing. Anne's aristocratic travelling companion was delighted by the sticky Yorkshire delicacy, describing it as '<i>next to vanilla cake in goodness</i>'.<br> Vere's approval pleased Anne, who remarked in her diary that Miss Hobart '<i>spoke as if with some regard for consideration for Shibden</i>'. With the bills for the groceries, servants and the carriage being sorted amicably, Anne commented drily how Vere liked her enough to let her '<i>pay for, and give her as much as I like</i>.'<br> It was providence - or '<i>dame destiny</i>', as Anne sometimes liked to call it - that brought Anne Lister and Vere Hobart to Hastings together in the winter of 1831. Anne's original plan to travel to Spain with another friend, Lady Caroline Duff Gordon, had failed at the last minute, leaving her unsure of her next move. She didn't like the idea of returning to Shibden, where she found living harmoniously with her younger sister Marian - the '<i>cock of the dunghill</i>' - a challenge.<br> However, while it was a disappointment not to be going abroad with '<i>quick, clever and agreeable</i>' Lady Gordon, who had already proven herself a '<i>woman of the world</i>' and ideal travel companion on a tour of the Pyrenees with Anne in 1829, Anne herself recognised that the aborted travel plan was financially serendipitous. Still to receive her full inheritance of Shibden Hall, Anne had to watch how much she was spending. On top of that, the threat of cholera made the prospect of travelling to Europe, with anyone, less attractive. Anne noted on 20th September 1831 that '<i>people were in great alarm</i>' over the disease. They included Lady Stuart de Rothesay, a relative of Vere Hobart, who had by now been settled upon as Anne's travelling companion. Concerned that travel would exacerbate Vere's persistent and debilitating cough, Lady Stuart de Rothesay warned Anne that '<i>to go abroad was madness . . . even to Milan</i>'.<br> Anne agreed. She was fearful of cholera too. By now, the epidemic had reached the village of Wibsey, only three miles from Shibden and, while nothing could compare to the '<i>health breathing gales</i>' of the West Yorkshire dales, she conceded that Hastings and the healthy, bracing winds of the south coast could suit her and Vere both.<br> Anne Lister had been introduced to the Hobarts and Stuart de Rothesays in 1829 by Vere's late aunt, Sibella Maclean. They were important society people; Vere's cousin, Charles Stuart, the husband of Lady Stuart de Rothesay, was ambassador at the British Embassy in Paris, and Vere was the daughter of the Honourable George Hobart, Earl of Buckinghamshire. They had stylish residences dotted around London (in St James' Park, Richmond and Marylebone), as well as the palatial Highcliffe Castle in Dorset. Theirs was a world far removed from draughty Shibden and Anne's own family. But Anne was a skilled social networker. Always ambitious to forge links with the upper echelons of society, she charmed herself into their circle with her charismatic personality - and perhaps a slightly romanticised vision of her ancestral seat.<br> When Lady Stuart identified Anne as a '<i>highly&nbsp;respectable person</i>' to accompany her great-niece to Hastings, Anne was more than satisfied with the arrangement. '<i>Well</i>,' she wrote in her diary, '<i>I shall have more society with Vere at Hastings, and I had better be with her there than wander about the continent thro' cholera alone. I do the kindness and it suits me well</i>' (21st September 1831).<br> Doing '<i>the kindness</i>' was something Anne was already practised in, having acted as a chaperone to Vere during the Stuarts' stay in Paris two years previously. As well as a milestone in Anne's conquest of her new aristocratic friends, it proved significant in her love life: it was during this trip of 1829-1830 that Anne determined to win Vere's heart.<br> However, Anne's first impressions of Vere were not entirely favourable. On 8th July in 1829, when the two women paid a visit to the Conservatoire des Artes to look at the horology exhibition, Vere had to be persuaded to go in. At twenty-seven years of age, she lacked Anne's natural confidence. She did not like the look of the gathering crowd outside, made up mostly of men. Anne, who had no such qualms about propriety, thought to herself that Vere was '<i>a goose</i>'. In another diary entry, she branded her a '<i>noodle</i>'. Later, when comparing her with Mariana Lawton, the on-off lover for whom she still harboured complicated feelings, Anne decided, unkindly, that Vere was simply '<i>a good humoured fat girl</i>' (30th July 1829).<br> But as the two women got better acquainted, and Vere became more comfortable in her company, Anne changed her mind. She became '<i>decidedly attentive</i>' towards Vere, '<i>playing the agreeable</i>' at every opportunity. She began, slowly, to make Vere aware of the nature of her liking for her, recording in her journal every detail of the flirtation that was developing between them. She wrote that she was allowed to unhook Vere's gown on going to bed (but was not permitted to untie her petticoats), and that Vere played love ballads for her on the piano. When she told Vere that '<i>she was pretty, had the prettiest mouth I ever saw</i>', she noted that Vere took the compliment very well. Having initially thought that her '<i>chance would not be great with Miss Hobart', </i>Anne soon reassessed <i>- ''tis now clear she likes me</i>' (Travel journal, 13th-14th OCTOBER 1829).<br> Vere would go on to describe Anne as '<i>the most extraordinary person</i>' she had ever met. It is clear that she was increasingly cognisant of Anne's sexuality. When Anne asked why, unlike their mutual friend, Lady Gordon, she was not allowed into Vere's bedroom, Vere's reply was revealing: Lady Gordon would '<i>not remember what she saw, and you</i> [Anne] <i>would never forget it</i>'. On a separate occasion, Vere told Anne that when Anne happened to touch her, it led to a 'ticklish' feeling she could not quite fathom (Travel journal, 17th OCTOBER 1829). Buoyed by this encouragement, Anne stepped up her efforts to forge a romantic connection with Vere.<br> Anne told Vere that she was going to construct a special cryptic alphabet, a secret language in which they could write to each other. Sharing her crypt-hand with potential lovers was a technique Anne had used before, and her imagination started to run away with her. '<i>What will she write to me?</i>' she wondered.<br> Vere waivered, worried about the attention such a pointedly private correspondence might bring to her friendship with Anne. Noting her concern, Anne reported, '<i>People might think if she used it she was writing something improper - it would not look well to use it.</i>' Anne nevertheless succeeded in talking Vere '<i>off her scruples</i>' and into using the secret code (16th OCTOBER 1829).<br> Anne enjoyed making gifts to Vere. As well as a beautiful hand-embroidered handkerchief with a '<i>pretty, coloured gothic border</i>' and expensive bottle of eau-de-cologne, there was a bottle of '<i>golden ink</i>':<br><br><i>Gave her the little bottle of golden ink. She kissed me for it of her own accord. I laughed and said the skies would fall. We all sat in her bedroom, writing journal and accounts. She showed me a line or two of nonsense and asked me to write 'festina lente', which I did.</i><br><i> T</i>RAVEL JOURNAL, 19th OCTOBER 1829</p><p>Vere's request for '<i>more haste, less speed</i>' was a significant acknowledgement of Anne's attentions. What Vere wanted was for Anne to slow down, to moderate her occasionally over-bearing manner towards her. Anne might have anticipated this, having noted in her journal some months before:</p><p><i>I cannot quite make Miss H out - whether she does not like me much, whether I have overdone it with attention - or whether she likes me and does not want to show it - and rather flirts with me. Is the latter possible?<br></i>31st JULY 1829</p><p>Throughout her stay in Paris, Anne was eager to make a good impression on Lady Stuart de Rothesay and elderly Lady Stuart. She made sure to act with what she felt was the utmost propriety, careful not to raise eyebrows with her eccentricity. It was an approach which yielded mixed results, not least because Anne found it hard to resist acting in a decidedly gentlemanly fashion.<br> '<i>We get very cozy and good friends,' wrote Anne, after a late night in Lady Stuart de Rothesay's company. 'Talked about women's characters. She very liberal. We quite agreed on this point. She talked to me exactly as she would to a married man, and surely feels quite at ease with me</i>' (30th JULY 1830).<br> Anne was becoming more relaxed around her new 'high-ton' (i.e., 'posh') friends, as she called them. Three days earlier, conversation between the two women had been more guarded. Anne, not wishing to demonstrate an intellectual prowess above that of someone of superior rank, had given Lady Stuart de Rothesay the last word on the subject of Creationism:</p><p><i>Got onto the first chapter of Genesis. The light created before the sun. She talked some moments of which I, too civil to take any advantage, in spite of her saying the sun was created afterwards. She thought it not necessary to believe it not existing before the creation of our world. There were many suns and systems.</i><br>27th JULY 1830</p><p>Having already forged connections with leading French scientists, Anne was in a position to treat her friends to some unusual cultural experiences in Paris. Now, at the invitation of the scientist �tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, she took Vere and the Stuart de Rothesays to see the inside of a skeleton of a female whale. Lady Stuart de Rothesay, her two young daughters, Charlotte and Louisa, as well as Vere and elderly Lady Stuart, gamely followed Anne up the '<i>carpeted ladders</i>' to take their seat inside the skeleton, '<i>in which</i>' wrote Anne, '<i>30 persons can sit</i>' among '<i>tables and books and newspapers</i>'. When Monsieur Saint-Hilaire had to leave the party temporarily, she took over the lecture with panache. '<i>All listened with attention</i>,' she said, '<i>And the thing went off well</i>.'<br> Vere, it seems, agreed. Anne reported their conversation in her diary: '<i>Said she, "I do not know whether you will think it a compliment but the children [</i>Louisa and Charlotte<i>] said to me, "We wished Miss Lister would begin again for we understood her much better than Monsieur Hilaire</i>".' Anne gave herself a pat on the back: '<i>That will do well enough</i>' (10th July 1829).<br>Those children who had been so captivated by Anne Lister would go on to lead extraordinary adult lives themselves. Charlotte Stuart became Viscountess Canning when she married the son of the former Prime Minister George Canning. By 1842, two years after Anne's death, Charlotte Canning was Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria. She achieved success in her own right as an artist of Indian landscapes.<br> Charlotte's younger sister Louisa Stuart, who became Marchioness of Waterford, also trained as an artist, under the tutelage of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Her image was said to have inspired some of the Pre-Raphaelite painters. Augustus Hare's 1893 biography,<i> The Story of Two Noble Lives</i>, gives great insight into the characters of the two women, and gives a flavour of the auspicious social circles in which Anne Lister had found herself moving by the 1830s.<br> Vere was quick to offer Anne unsolicited pointers about how to behave in high society. Anne recorded more than one occasion in Paris when Vere indicated that she felt Anne's inquisitive mind was getting the better of her in the company of people of rank. Vere only wanted Anne to make a good impression. It was not the 'done thing' to have asked Lord Cosmo Gordon to name his '<i>favourite hero of antiquity</i>'. '<i>You will puzzle him</i>,' she said. Similarly, when Anne had asked Sir Charles Bagot, a member of the Privy Council who served as British Ambassador to Russia and to the Netherlands, why he '<i>disliked Petersburgh people</i>' Vere was quick to tell her that such people '<i>Cannot always answer such leading questions</i>' (18th OCTOBER 1829).<br> Initially defensive - '<i>If people express a decided opinion, they subject themselves to a decided question as to why and wherefore</i>' - Anne, who was given to periods of introspection and self-analysis, went on to absorb Vere's remarks about her behaviour. She was aware that she was used to being in a position of control. At Shibden, she took charge of running of her own estate and managing the people who lived and worked on it. There, she behaved in a manner befitting her rank, as landowner and employer of men. She was looked up to. It was becoming clear to her that she would need to learn a new set of behaviours if she was to succeed and be accepted in this social circle:</p><p><i>But, thought I, there is a good hint - never ask a too decided or abrupt question. She little thinks how much I have had to learn - when to talk and when not. I was too new among such society to quite know how to manage for the best. I was anxious not to appear too familiar. My manner wants to be more easy and liante [sociable] without being too much so, but I do not fancy people see thro' the real person. Better think me stupid and reserved and cold than the contrary . . .<br>I must dress well, and having everything nice, and reading all the works of the day, and studying at the same time - nothing but this to bear me thro'. I must see to about having a carriage. I can then be useful to people and this will do something.<br></i>TRAVEL JOURNAL, 18th OCTOBER 1829</p><p>Anne was painfully aware of the gulf that existed between her and her monied friends. Vere was somehow under the impression that Anne had an income of �5,000 a year, a piece of misinformation which Anne chose not to correct. '<i>Oh, if they saw my father and Shibden and knew all</i>' she wrote in her travel journal on 15th October 1829, horrified at the prospect of them discovering her real circumstances.</p></p><h2>Mysteries, Marvels and Miracles</h2><p>Includes hundreds of true stories of miraculous phenomena in the lives of the Saints: bilocation, levitation, multiplication of food, etc. Fascinating, hard to put down, and helpful to strengthen one\&#39;s faith.

And considering that the "one man" is Neal Stephenson, "the hacker Hemingway" (<em>Newsweek</em>) -- acclaimed novelist, pragmatist, seer, nerd-friendly philosopher, and nationally bestselling author of groundbreaking literary works (<em>Snow Crash, Cryptonomicon,</em> etc., etc.) -- the word is well worth hearing. Mostly well-reasoned examination and partial rant, Stephenson's <em>In the Beginning... was the Command Line</em> is a thoughtful, irreverent, hilarious treatise on the cyber-culture past and present; on operating system tyrannies and downloaded popular revolutions; on the Internet, Disney World, Big Bangs, not to mention the meaning of life itself.</p></p><p>Neal Stephenson, author of the sprawling and engaging <i>Cryptonomicon</i>, has written a manifesto that could be spoken by a character from that brilliant book. Primarily, <i>In the Beginning ... Was the Command Line</i> discusses the past and future of personal computer operating systems. "It is the fate of manufactured goods to slowly and gently depreciate as they get old," he writes, "but it is the fate of operating systems to become free." While others in the computer industry express similarly dogmatic statements, Stephenson charms the reader into his way of thinking, providing anecdotes and examples that turn the pages for you.<p> Stephenson is a techie, and he's writing for an audience of coders and hackers in <i>Command Line</i>. The idea for this essay began online, when a shortened version of it was posted on <i>Slashdot.org</i>. The book still holds some marks of an e-mail flame gone awry, and some tangents should have been edited to hone his formidable arguments. But unlike similar writers who also discuss technical topics, he doesn't write to exclude; readers who appreciate computing history (like <i>Dealers of Lightning</i> or <i>Fire in the Valley</i>) can easily step into this book.</p><p> Stephenson tackles many myths about industry giants in this volume, specifically Apple and Microsoft. By now, every newspaper reader has heard of Microsoft's overbearing business practices, but Stephenson cuts to the heart of new issues for the software giant with a finely sharpened steel blade. Apple fares only a little better as Stephenson (a former Mac user himself) highlights the early steps the company took to prepare for a monopoly within the computer market--and its surprise when this didn't materialize. Linux culture gets a thorough--but fair--skewering, and the strengths of BeOS are touted (although no operating system is nearly close enough to perfection in Stephenson's eyes).</p><p> As for the rest of us, who have gladly traded free will and an intellectual understanding of computers for a clutter-free, graphically pleasing interface, Stephenson has thoughts to offer as well. He fully understands the limits nonprogrammers feel in the face of technology (an example being the "blinking 12" problem when your VCR resets itself). Even so, within <i>Command Line</i> he convincingly encourages us as a society to examine the metaphors of technology--simplifications that aren't really much simpler--that we greedily accept. <i>--Jennifer Buckendorff</i></p><p>Neal Stephenson is the bestselling author of the novels <em>Reamde</em>, <em>Anathem</em>, <em>The System of the World</em>, <em>The Confusion</em>, <em>Quicksilver</em>, <em>Cryptonomicon</em>, <em>The Diamond Age</em>, <em>Snow Crash</em>, and <em>Zodiac</em>, and the groundbreaking nonfiction work <em>In the Beginning . . .

In <i>A Chain of Thunder,</i> the action shifts to the fortress city of Vicksburg, Mississippi. There, in the vaunted &#x201c;Gibraltar of the Confederacy,&#x201d; a siege for the ages will cement the reputation of one Union general&#x2014;and all but seal the fate of the rebel cause.<br> &nbsp;<br> In May 1863, after months of hard and bitter combat, Union troops under the command of Major General Ulysses S. Grant at long last successfully cross the Mississippi River. They force the remnants of Confederate Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton&#x2019;s army to retreat to Vicksburg, burning the bridges over the Big Black River in its path. But after sustaining heavy casualties in two failed assaults against the rebels, Union soldiers are losing confidence and morale is low. Grant reluctantly decides to lay siege to the city, trapping soldiers and civilians alike inside an iron ring of Federal entrenchments. Six weeks later, the starving and destitute Southerners finally surrender, yielding command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces on July 4&#x2014;Independence Day&#x2014;and marking a crucial turning point in the Civil War.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on comprehensive research and his own intimate knowledge of the Vicksburg Campaign, Jeff Shaara once again weaves brilliant fiction out of the ragged cloth of historical fact. From the command tents where generals plot strategy to the ruined mansions where beleaguered citizens huddle for safety, this is a panoramic portrait of men and women whose lives are forever altered by the siege. On one side stand the emerging legend Grant, his irascible second William T. Sherman, and the youthful &#x201c;grunt&#x201d; Private Fritz Bauer; on the other, the Confederate commanders Pemberton and Joseph Johnston, as well as nineteen-year-old Lucy Spence, a civilian doing her best to survive in the besieged city. By giving voice to their experiences at Vicksburg, <i>A Chain of Thunder</i> vividly evokes a battle whose outcome still reverberates more than 150 years after the cannons fell silent.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>A Chain of Thunder</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;[Jeff] Shaara continues to draw powerful novels from the bloody history of the Civil War. . . .

He lives in Gettysburg.VICKSBURG, MISSISSIPPI<br> APRIL 16, 1863<br> &nbsp;<br> The ball was a glorious affair, the Confederate officers in their finest gray, adorned with plumed hats and sashes at their waists. There was dancing and a feast of every kind of local fare, even the wine flowing with no one&#x2019;s disapproval. By ten o&#x2019;clock, most of the older citizens had retired, the senior officers gone as well, offering the reasonable excuse that there were duties to perform, an early morning that would come too soon. Those who remained were the young and the unmarried, no one among them objecting to that. The music continued, more lively now, the quartet of violinists respecting the youth in the room, waltzes that brought the officers closer to the young women, hands extended, those girls who had caught the eye, whose furtive glances spoke of flirtation, the daring willingness to accept the invitation of a young man who had the courage or the skills to lead a dance.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the night wore on, and the matrons drifted away, Lucy had allowed herself a single dance, had caught a beaming smile from a young lieutenant, one of the Louisiana regiments. She knew nothing of a soldier&#x2019;s life, what authority he carried, but the face was handsome, a firm jaw and bright blue eyes, clean-shaven, the young man&#x2019;s hand extended toward her with smiling optimism, hinting of hope. She knew he had been watching her for most of the evening, and she had smiled at him once, was immediately embarrassed by that, quick glances to be certain that none of the others noticed. But now, as the energy of the ball rose with the youthfulness of those who remained, so too did her courage. And, apparently, his.<br> &nbsp;<br> The waltz they danced to had been familiar, the violins doing admirable service with a pleasing rhythm that seemed to intoxicate her, the young officer admirably graceful. The couple was one of a half dozen who moved with elegance across the floor, but it ended too soon. With visible regret, the lieutenant had done what was required, had properly escorted her back to one side of the room, where the ladies sat, the officers returning to their own station, closer to where the wine flowed.<br> &nbsp;<br> She sat, maneuvering the wide hoops of her finest gown, still glancing at the other girls, the rivalry they all observed. Such occasions were rare now. The welcome invitation had come from Major Watt, the officer spreading word that a gala was well deserved. But many stayed away, a gloomy acceptance that perhaps this kind of frivolity was not yet appropriate, not with the Yankees so close. For months now, the citizens had endured shellfire, Federal gunboats with the audacity to throw their projectiles into the city itself. Most of those boats were anchored far upriver, and the officers in the town boasted of that, that Federal sailors knew they could not match the enormous power of the guns dug into the hillsides across the riverfront. But still the shells came, and many of the civilians had heeded the advice of the army&#x2019;s senior commanders, had begun to move out of their homes, digging themselves into caves and caverns, most dug by the labor of Negroes.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first serious violence had come close to Christmas, and the customary Christmas ball had been rudely preempted by one of &#x201c;the first great assaults, what so many of the townspeople described as the barbarity of the Yankees, their utter disregard for simple courtesy, for the sacred observance of Christmas ritual. Major Watt seemed to recognize that as well, and with the warmer weather came the army&#x2019;s gift to the town, driven by the kindness of this one major, who seemed to understand that the civilians would be buoyed by a party, a show of defiance toward the ever-present gunboats. Though the attendance was not as large as the major had hoped, the air of protest was there still, and like the others who attended the ball, the young Miss Spence thought it entirely appropriate that the townspeople make some effort to improve their own morale. Since Christmas, most of the people had gone about their business as though nothing were really happening upriver, as if the Yankees were there just for show, a protest of their own. Businesses continued to operate, the markets mostly able to stock their shelves, citizens freely traveling to the countryside. Even the occasional bombardments were part of the routine, and for the most part the damage had been minimal, the shelling more random than targeted. Like Lucy, most of her neighbors had sought the protection of Providence, that if a shell was to find them, it would be the hand of God and not the unfortunate aim of some devilish Yankee gunner. After all, the people of Vicksburg had done nothing to deserve such violence.<br> &nbsp;<br> She watched her young lieutenant across the room, was disappointed to see a glance at a pocket watch. The music began to slow, and the atmosphere in the grand room was growing heavy with shared sleepiness. It was, after all, near ten o&#x2019;clock, far beyond the bedtime of even the young.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lucy felt the same weariness, suppressed a yawn, heard the talk around her, much as it had been all evening. The young women spoke of those things Lucy had kept mostly to herself: who among the men in their gray finery were the best dancers, the most handsome, who had embarrassed himself by enjoying a bit too much wine. She held quietly to the warm glow that came from the single dance with her lieutenant, that it was her young man who outshone them all. She wondered about Louisiana, not the swamps that spread out for miles across the river, but down south, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, sophisticated places she could only imagine. Surely he was from the cities, she thought, a cultured man, familiar with music and libraries, perhaps from a military academy. Her imagination was fed by the sleepiness, and she blinked hard, fought to keep anyone from noticing that, saw him glance at his watch again, a scowl on his face. Then he glanced toward her, and she looked away, then back, wanted to smile, held it, scolded herself. He was speaking to another officer now, a captain, both men showing regret that this one beacon of color and gaiety had to come to an end. He began to move toward her, and her heart jumped, a blend of hope and alarm that he might ask to escort her home. She felt a slight shiver, and he seemed to hesitate, gathering courage of his own.<br> &nbsp;<br> And now came a large thump of thunder, a jolt in the floor beneath her feet, the chandelier quivering, the entire room suddenly motionless. Another rumble came, but it was not close. She saw the lieutenant looking past her and realized he was staring toward the river, where the army had anchored its largest guns. Now the firing thundered closer, the officers speaking up, calming voices, that it was their own guns, not the enemy. To one side a door burst open, an older officer moving in quickly, searching, finding Major Watt, a quick word between them. Watt turned to them all and gained their attention.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I regret,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;this ball has concluded. The Yankee boats are coming downriver, and you must retire to your shelters. Do not hesitate. Officers, report immediately to your posts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> There was authority in his words, and the men were quick to move, filing toward the wide entranceway, already disappearing into the darkness. She caught sight of the lieutenant, but he did not look back, and she pushed that from her mind, rose up with the other women, some of the officers lingering, standing to one side, allowing them to pass. There were questions, but no panic, so many of the civilians having experienced all of this before. Major Watt stood by the door, still their host, and offered a smile, pleasantries to the women, with the slight edge of firmness.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go on home, now. We shall deal with the Yankees. This has been a most pleasant evening. It shall be still, if our artillerymen have their way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She passed the major, was outside now, a cool night, no moon, a hint of lantern light from the homes that lined the street. But quickly those grew dark, the usual caution, no needless targets offered to any Yankee gunner who might be telescoping this very place. She stepped onto the hard dirt, being careful to avoid the ruts from wagon wheels, and heard the talk around her in hushed excitement. She felt it as well, that there was something different about this assault. She looked in every direction, still no shells coming into the town, the sounds all toward the river. The soldiers were mostly gone, with only a few, the usual guards drifting past, offering assistance if any was required. Lucy saw a cluster of women moving uphill, not toward their homes, but toward the magnificent vantage point, what they all called Sky Parlor Hill. It was the highest point in the city, a knob of land the width of two city blocks, and during the daytime it was the most popular place for couples to gather, for picnics and courtship.</p><h2>Big Cherry Holler: A Novel (Big Stone Gap)</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Heartwarming . . .

Henrys second wife and mother of Elizabeth I, Anne was the first English queen to be publicly executed. Yet what do we know of the achievements and legacy of her short reign?In The Life and Death of Anne Boleyn Eric Ives provides the most detailed and convincing portrait we have of the queen. He reveals a person of intellect with a passion for the new culture of the Renaissance, a woman who made her way in a mans world by force of education and personality. She played a powerful and independent role in the faction-ridden court of Henry VIII and the unceasing struggle for royal favour that was Tudor politics. The consequences can still be detected today. Indeed, Ives shows that it was precisely because Anne was a powerful figure in her own right that it needed a coup to bring her down. She had to be stopped even by a lie.<b>Eric Ives</b> is Emeritus Professor of English History at the University of Birmingham.

Thompson.<br><br>Brazen, incisive, and outrageous as ever, this second volume of Thompson&#x2019;s private correspondence is the highly anticipated follow-up to <i>The Proud Highway</i>. When that first book of letters appeared in 1997, Time pronounced it "deliriously entertaining"; Rolling Stone called it "brilliant beyond description"; and <i>The New York Times</i> celebrated its "wicked humor and bracing political conviction." <br> <br>Spanning the years between 1968 and 1976, these never-before-published letters show Thompson building his legend: running for sheriff in Aspen, Colorado; creating the seminal road book <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i>; twisting political reporting to new heights for <i>Rolling Stone</i>; and making sense of it all in the landmark <i>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</i>. To read Thompson's dispatches from these years&#x2014;addressed to the author's friends, enemies, editors, and creditors, and such notables as Jimmy Carter, Tom Wolfe, and Kurt Vonnegut&#x2014;is to read a raw, revolutionary eyewitness account of one of the most exciting and pivotal eras in American history.</p><p>Hunter S. Thompson was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky. His books include <i>Hell's Angels</i>, <i>Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</i>, <i>The Rum Diary</i>, and <i>Better than Sex</i>. He died in February 2005.<b>From Chapter One</b> <p> OWL FARM -- WINTER OF '68: </p><p> 1967 was the year of the hippy. As this is the last meditation I intend to write on that subject, I decided, while composing it, to have the proper background. So, in the same small room with me and my typewriter, I have two huge speakers and a 100 watt music amplifier booming out Bob Dylan's "Mr. Tambourine Man." This, to me, is the Hippy National Anthem. It's an acid or LSD song -- and like much of the hippy music, its lyrics don't make much sense to anyone not "cool" or "with it" or "into the drug scene." I was living in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district when the word "hippy" was coined by <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> columnist Herb Caen -- who also came up with "beatnik," in the late 1950s -- so I figure I'm entitled to lean on personal experience in these things. To anyone who was part of that (post-beat) scene before the word "hippy" became a national publicity landmark (in 1966 and 1967), "Mr. Tambourine Man" is both an epitaph and a swan-song for the lifestyle and the instincts that led, eventually, to the hugely-advertised "hippy phenomenon." </p><p> Bob Dylan was the original hippy, and anyone curious about the style and tone of the "younger generation's" thinking in the early 1960s has only to play his albums in chronological order. They move from folk-whimsy to weird humor to harsh social protest during the time of the civil rights marches and the Mississippi summer protests of 1963 and '64. Then, in the months after the death of President Kennedy, Dylan switched from the hard commitments of social realism to the more abstract "realities" of neo-protest and disengagement. His style became one of eloquent despair and personal anarchism. His lyrics became increasingly drug-oriented, with double-entendres and dual meanings that were more and more obvious, until his "Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35" was banned by radio stations from coast to coast...mainly because of the chorus line saying "Everybody must get stoned...." </p><p> By this time he was a folk hero to the "under thirty generation" that seemed to be in total revolt against everything their elders were trying to believe in. By this time, too, Dylan was flying around the country -- from one sold-out concert to another -- in his private jet plane, worth about $500,000. His rare press conferences were jammed by reporters who treated them more like an audience with a Wizard than a question and answer session with an accidental public figure. At the same time, Dylan's appearance became more and more bizarre. When he began singing in Greenwich Village about 1960 his name was Bob Zimmerman and he looked like a teen-age hobo in the Huck Finn tradition...or like the Nick Adams of the early Hemingway stories. But by 1965 he had changed his last name to Dylan &amp; was wearing shoulder-length hair and rubber-tight, pin-stripe suits that reflected the colorful &amp; sarcastically bisexual image that was, even then, becoming the universal style of a sub-culture called "hippies." </p><p> This focus on Dylan is no accident. Any culture -- and especially any sub-culture -- can be at least tentatively defined by its heroes...and of all the hippy heroes, Bob Dylan was first and foremost. He appeared at a time when Joan Baez was the Queen Bee of that world of the young and alienated...but unlike Joanie, who wrote none of her own songs and preferred wistful ballads to contemporary drug anthems, Dylan moved on to become the voice of an anguished and half-desperate generation. Or at least that part of a generation that saw itself as doomed and useless in terms of the status-quo, business-as-usual kind of atmosphere that prevailed in this country as the war in Vietnam went from bad to worse and the United States, in the eyes of the whole world's "under thirty generation," seemed to be drifting toward a stance of vengeful, uncontrolled militarism. </p><p> The fact that this viewpoint wasn't (and still isn't) universal deserves a prominent mention, but it has little to do with the hippies. They are a product of a growing disillusion with the military/industrial realities of life in these United States, and in terms of sheer numbers, they represent a minority that doubles and triples its numbers every year. By 1967 this minority viewpoint had emerged, full-blown, in the American mass media...and it obviously had a powerful appeal -- at least to the publishers, editors and reporters who measured the public taste and found it overwhelmingly ready for a dose of hippy articles. The reason for this is the reason the hippies exist -- not necessarily because of any inherent worth of their own, but because they emphasize, by their very existence, the same uneasy vacuum in American life that also gave birth to the beatniks some ten years earlier. Not even the people who think all hippies should be put in jail or sent to the front-lines in Vietnam will quarrel with what is usually accepted as the Hippy Ethic -- Peace, Love, and Every Man for Himself in a Free-Wheeling Orgy of Live and Let Live. </p><p> The hippies threatened the establishment by dis-interring some of the most basic and original "American values," and trying to apply them to life in a sprawling, high-pressure technocracy that has come a long way, in nearly 200 years, from the simple agrarian values that prevailed at the time of the Boston Tea Party. The hippies are a menace in the form of an anachronism, a noisy reminder of values gone sour and warped...of the painful contradictions in a society conceived as a monument to "human freedom" and "individual rights," a nation in which all men are supposedly "created free and equal"...a nation that any thinking hippy will insist has become a fear-oriented "warfare state" that can no longer afford to tolerate even the minor aberrations that go along with "individual freedom." </p><p> I remember that pre-hippy era in San Francisco as a good, wild-eyed, free-falling time when everything seemed to be coming out right. I had an exciting book to write, and a publisher to pay for it, and a big chrome-red motorcycle to boom around the midnight streets wearing a sweatshirt and cut-off levis and wellington boots, running from angry cop cars on the uphill blocks of Ashbury st, doubling back suddenly and running 90 miles an hour up Masonic toward the Presidio...then gearing down, laughing, on the twisting black curves with the white line leading through the middle of that woodsy fortress, past the MP shack out to the crowded lights on Lombard st, with the cold Bay and the yacht club and Alcatraz off to the left and all the steep postcards of cable car San Francisco looking down from the other side. Getting off Lombard to avoid the lights and roaring down Union st, past the apartment where that girl used to live and wondering who's up there now, then around the corner by the dentist's office (and I still owe that man two hundred and eleven dollars. Pay him off, pay all those old debts...who else do I owe? Send a bill, you bastards. I want to flush those beggar memories...). </p><p> Around the corner and down a few blocks on Union to the Matrix, a blank-looking place on the right, up on the sidewalk and park between those two small trees, knowing the cops will come around yelling and trying to ticket the bike for being off the street (Park that motorcycle in the gutter, boy...). Maybe seeing Pete Knell's orange chopper parked in that gutter. Pete was then the talking spirit of the Frisco Angels and later president of that doomed and graceless chapter...sometimes he played a banjo in the Drinking Gourd up on Union, but that was before he became a fanatic. </p><p> The Matrix, womb of the Jefferson Airplane. They owned part of the club when it still served booze, and maybe they own it all now. They've rolled up a lot of points since that night when I reeled through the door with no money, muttering "Jerry Anderson invited me," and then found Jerry somewhere in back, listening to his wife Signe wailing out in front of the Airplane's half-formed sound. Signe with the trombone voice, and Marty Balin polishing his eternal signature song that he titled, for some wrong reason, "And I Like It." I recall telling Jerry, while he paid for my beer, that this Jefferson Airplane thing was a surefire famous money bomb for everybody connected with it...and later calling Ralph Gleason, the <i>Chronicle</i>'s special pleader, to tell him the Airplane was something worth hearing. "Yeah, sure," he said. "People keep telling me about these groups; I try to check em out -- you know how it is." Sure, Ralph...not knowing if he remembered that about a year earlier I'd pushed another group on him, a group that almost immediately got a record contract without help and then exploded into oblivion when Davy, the lead singer, choked to death on his own vomit in an elegant house on the beach in Carmel. </p><p> But about a year after the Airplane opened at the Matrix, Gleason wrote the notes for their first record jacket. </p><p> The Jefferson Airplane is another key sound from that era -- like Dylan and the Grateful Dead. And Grace Slick, who made even the worst Matrix nights worth sitting through. In that era she was carrying a hopeless group called The Great Society, which eventually made it by croaking the group and going off in different directions. But Grace Slick was always my best reason for going to the Matrix. I would sit back in the corner by the projection booth and watch her do all those things that she later did with the Airplane and for <i>LOOK</i> magazine, but which seemed so much better then, because she was her own White Rabbit....I was shocked to learn she was married to the drummer. But I got a lot of shocks in that era...my nerves were pretty close to the surface and everything registered. It's hard to understand now, why "things seemed to be coming out right." But I remember that feeling, that we were all making it somehow. And the only one around who had already made it was Ken Kesey, who seemed to be working overtime to find the downhill tube. Which he eventually did, and I recall some waterhead creep accusing me (in the <i>L.A. Free Press</i>) of "giving away" Kesey's secret address in Par...</p></p><h2>Disability and the Gospel: How God Uses Our Brokenness to Display His Grace</h2><p><p>Explores key Bible passages on brokenness and disability to develop helpful principles for believers and churches, teaching them first to embrace their own brokenness and then to embrace those who are more physically and visibly broken.</p></p><p><p><strong>Michael S.

In these pages, you'll learn countless ways to grow in such virtue.</p> <p>The wise Msgr. Romano Guardini, a German priest hailed by Pope Benedict XVI as a great figure who aspired to the truth of God and to the truth of man, leads you from a consideration of virtue in itself to a discussion of each of the key virtues that will make you holy and lead you to God. </p> <p>Here you'll learn how to begin practicing the virtues and make them part of your daily routine. You'll also learn about:</p> <p><br> </p><li>Envy, the hidden sin, even in the spiritually mature: how to fight it </li> <li>Courtesy: how good manners are spiritually vital to souls</li> <li>"What is truth?" The surprising answer to Pilate's question will transform you</li> <li>Patience: it's the prerequisite for all moral growth, and only the morally strong attain it</li> <li>Orderliness: not a moral virtue in itself, but lack of it may cost your soul </li> <li>Why a sense of humor is so important even to your spiritual health</li> <li>The strange contradiction in blaming God for the evil in the world</li> <li>Belief in progress: in our day it can be a form of idolatry</li> <li>The tyranny of justice: why so many justice movements turn unjust (knowing this is the key to our future as a society)</li> <li>Asceticism: it's not just for monks without it, you may not be saved!</li> <li>Trashy movies: there's spiritual danger even in the ones that don't obviously glorify sin</li> <li>Discover why noise weakens the soul, and how silence is balm for your spiritual life</li> <li>Plus: many other topics to help you grow in the virtues that lead you to God!</li><p></p></p><p><p>Romano Guardini (1885 1968) is regarded as one of the most important Catholic intellectuals of the twentieth century. He lived in Germany most of his life and was ordained a priest in Mainz in 1910. Guardini s academic focus was philosophy of religion and he is best known for such works as <em>The Lord, The End of the Modern World</em> and <em>The Spirit of the Liturgy</em>. Guardini taught at the University of Berlin until he was forced to resign for criticizing Nazi mythologizing of Jesus and for emphasizing Christ s Jewishness. After World War II, he taught at the University of Tubingen and the University of Munich.</p><b>Mary Hartwell, TheIntegratedCatholicLife.org</b><br> "The virtues never change, but this book allows us to view them with fresh eyes. Fr. Guardini s insights give us an opportunity to strengthen our faith, our prayer life, and our relationships with those around us family, friends and strangers." --Endorsements</p><h2>Genetic Entropy</h2><p><i>Genetic Entropy</i> presents compelling scientific evidence that the genomes of all living creatures are slowly degenerating - due to the accumulation of slightly harmful mutations. This is happening in spite of natural selection. The author of this book, Dr. John Sanford, is a Cornell University geneticist. Dr. Sanford has devoted more than 10 years of his life to the study of this specific problem. Arguably, he has examined this problem in greater depth than any other scientist. The evidences that he presents are diverse and compelling. He begins by examining how random mutation and natural selection actually operate, and shows that simple logic demands that genomes must degenerate. He then makes a historical examination of the relevant field (population genetics), and shows that the best scientists in that field have consistently acknowledged many of the fundamental problems he has uncovered (but they have failed to communicate these problems to the broader scientific community). He then shows, in collaboration with a team of other scientists, that state-of-the-art numerical simulation experiments consistently confirm the problem of genetic degeneration (even given very strong selection and optimal conditions). Lastly, in collaboration with other scientists, he shows that real biological populations clearly manifest genetic degeneration.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Sanford's findings have enormous implications. His work largely invalidates classic neo-Darwinian theory. The mutation/selection process by itself is not capable of creating the new biological information that is required for creating new life forms. Dr. Sanford shows that not only is mutation/selection incapable of creating our genomes - it can't even preserve our genomes. As biochemist Dr. Michael Behe of Lehigh University writes in his review of <i>Genetic Entropy</i>, "...not only does Darwinism not have answers for how information got into the genome, it doesn't even have answers for how it could remain there." Dr. Sanford has coined the term "genetic entropy" to describe this fatal flaw of neo-Darwinian theory. This fundamental problem has been something of a trade-secret within the field of population genetics, with the rest of the world largely being kept in the dark. Fortunately, this book finally discloses this very serious problem, using language that is for the most part accessible to all scholars and students having a basic understanding of biology.<br> <br> This new edition of <i>Genetic Entropy</i> includes numerous new lines of evidence supporting Dr. Sanford's thesis. Much of this new evidence is from recently published scientific papers that are now part of the scientific literature. <i>Genetic Entropy</i> is a must-read for any thoughtful person who in interested in science.<br> Dr. Sanford ends his book by asking two questions. First, if our genome did not actually arise via the accumulation of genetic "word-processing errors" (as is claimed), how did it arise? Second, if our genomes are undergoing relentless degeneration - where can we possibly place our hope for the future?</p><p>Dr. John Sanford has been a Cornell University Professor for more than 30 years. He received his PhD from the University of Wisconsin in the area of plant breeding and plant genetics. While a professor at Cornell, John trained graduate students and conducted genetic research at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, NY. <br><br>At Cornell, John bred new crop varieties using conventional breeding and then became heavily involved in the newly-emerging field of plant genetic engineering. John has published over 100 scientific publications and has been granted several dozen patents. His most significant scientific contributions during the first half of his career involved three inventions: the biolistic ("gene gun") process, pathogen-derived resistance, and genetic immunization. A large fraction of the transgenic crops (in terms of numbers and acreage) grown in the world today were genetically engineered using the gene gun technology developed by John and his collaborators. John also started two biotech enterprises derived from his research, Biolistics, Inc., and Sanford Scientific, Inc. <br><br>John still holds a position at Cornell (Courtesy Associate Professor), but has largely retired from Cornell and has started a small non-profit organization, Feed My Sheep Foundation (FMS). Through FMS, John has conducted research in the areas of theoretical genetics and bioinformatics for the last 14 years. This book was the "first fruits" of those efforts.</p><h2>American Ballads and Folk Songs (Dover Books On Music: Folk Songs)</h2><p><p>"A book to cherish permanently." &#x2014; <i>The New York Times.<br></i>With this ample collection of authentic ballads and songs, you can immerse yourself in the rich tradition and heritage of American folk music.

For Jewish readers, it affirmed the Messiahship of Jesus, referring consistently to the Scriptures to establish his credentials. For Gentile disciples, it provided powerful and dramatic support of their inclusion in God&#x2019;s kingdom. The cross of Christ had removed the division between Jew and non-Jew, and through Matthew&#x2019;s writings, we see Israel&#x2019;s God drawing the entire world to himself through Jesus.&#x201c;The Gospel according to Matthew . . . Was the most widely read and frequently used of any of the four Gospels in the formative years of the church,&#x201d; writes Michael Wilkins. In this volume of the NIV Application Commentary, Wilkins explains Matthew&#x2019;s broad appeal not only to his ancient readers, but also to us today. Exploring the links between the Bible and our own times, Wilkins shares perspectives on Matthew&#x2019;s Gospel that reveal its enduring relevance for our twenty-first-century lives.Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from our world to the world of the Bible. But they leave us there, assuming that we can somehow make the return journey on our own. They focus on the original meaning of the passage but don&#x2019;t discuss its contemporary application. The information they offer is valuable&#x2015;but the job is only half done! The NIV Application Commentary Series helps bring both halves of the interpretive task together. This unique, award-winning series shows readers how to bring an ancient message into our present-day context.

Featured authors include Russell Baker on <i>Growing Up</i>; Jill Ker Conway on <i>The Road from Coorain</i>; Annie Dillard on An American Childhood; Ian Frazier on Family; Henry Louis Gates Jr. on Colored People; Alfred Kazin on <i>A Walker in the City</i>; Frank McCourt on <i>Angela's Ashes</i>; Toni Morrison on <i>Beloved</i>; and Eileen Simpson on <i>Poets in Their Youth</i>.</p></p><p>Every time <i>Inventing the Truth</i> appears in a new edition, editor William Zinsser can't help but add to it. The first edition (1987) evolved from a series of New York Public Library talks, for which the mandate was not to lecture about the genre of the memoir but to explain how a specific memoir came to be written. In the book's 1995 edition, Russell Baker, Annie Dillard, Alfred Kazin, and Toni Morrison were joined by Jill Ker Conway, Eileen Simpson, Henry Louis Gates Jr., and Ian Frazier. This time around, Zinsser has added a rich and charming reminiscence by Frank McCourt (<i>Angela's Ashes</i>).<p> The authors do stick to their assignment: Russell Baker credits his huge family with helping him "learn a lot about humanity from close-up observation"; Jill Ker Conway talks about her desire to write a female memoir that was not a romantic happily-ever-after; and Henry Louis Gates Jr. discusses "want[ing] to write a book that imitated the specialness of black culture when no white people are around." But there is also plenty of advice for writers here, and some general thoughts about the genre. Conway addresses the difficulty of "going back as a historian" and trying to understand "all the things you took as a given when you were a child." Gates warns us to "be prepared for the revelation of things you don't even dream are going to come up." And Annie Dillard contemplates the strangeness of spending "more time writing about [a scene or an event] than you did living it." <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>William Zinsser is a writer, editior, and teacher.

To celebrate Ferdinand&#39;s seventy-fifth anniversary, Viking is issuing his story in a handsome slipcased edition. Perfect for those who love Ferdinand, and for those who have yet to meet him.</p><p><p>What else can be said about the fabulous Ferdinand? Published more than 50 years ago (and one of the bestselling children's books of all time), this simple story of peace and contentment has withstood the test of many generations. Ferdinand is a little bull who much prefers sitting quietly under a cork tree-- just smelling the flowers--to jumping around, snorting, and butting heads with other bulls. This cow is no coward--he simply has his pacifist priorities clear. As Ferdinand grows big and strong, his temperament remains mellow, until the day he meets with the wrong end of a bee. In a show of bovine irony, the one day Ferdinand is most definitely <i>not</i> sitting quietly under the cork tree (due to a frightful sting), is the selfsame day that five men come to choose the "biggest, fastest, roughest bull" for the bullfights in Madrid. </p><p>Ferdinand's day in the arena gives readers not only an education in the historical tradition of bullfighting, but also a lesson in nonviolent tranquility. Robert Lawson's black-and-white drawings are evocative and detailed, with especially sweet renditions of Ferdinand, the serene bull hero. <i>The Story of Ferdinand</i> closes with one of the happiest endings in the history of happy endings--readers of all ages will drift off to a peaceful sleep, dreaming of sweet-smelling flowers and contented cows.</p>In Spain lives a big and strong bull whose name is Ferdinand. Unlike the other bulls, Ferdinand does not like to fight. He would rather sit in the shade of his favorite cork tree and smell the flowers.</p><h2>Orchid Blues (Holly Barker)</h2><p><b>Stuart Woods brings back small-town police chief Holly Barker&#x2014;and her extraordinary Doberman, Daisy&#x2014;for another exhilarating adventure in this <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.<br><br></b>When Holly Barker&#x2019;s wedding festivities are shattered by a brutal robbery, she vows to find the culprits.

It was an older Ford commercial van, well cared for and clean. &#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; he said. He got out of the car and grabbed his tool bag. &#x201c;Drive over to the edge of the parking lot and wait. When you see the van&#x2019;s headlights go on, follow me home. I&#x2019;ll be making a lot of turns.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yessir,&#x201d; the boy said.<br>He slipped a pair of rubber gloves on, then &nbsp;walked over to the van and tried the door. Unlocked. It took him less than a minute to punch the steering lock and start the van. He switched on the lights and checked the odometer: 48,000 miles; not bad. He backed out of the parking space and drove out of the lot, onto the highway. In the rearview mirror he watched the boy fall in behind him, well back. He drove for a couple of minutes, constantly making turns, checking the mirror; then he turned down a dirt road, drove a hundred yards and stopped. The boy stopped behind him. He sat in the van and watched the traffic pass on the highway for five minutes; then he made a U-turn and went back to the highway and headed west. He had two hours before the van&#x2019;s owner would come out of the movies and discover his loss, but he needed only half an hour.<br>Twenty-five minutes later, he drove into the little town, and five minutes after that, he pulled the van into the large steel shed behind his business. Half a dozen men, who had been sitting around a poker table, stood up and walked over.<br>&#x201c;Looks good,&#x201d; one of them said.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll do. Only 48K on the clock, and it runs like a sewing machine. Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d;<br>Everybody went to work. First, they donned rubber gloves, then they washed the van thoroughly and cleaned the interior, and fastened two rough wooden benches to the floor. Two men unrolled a large decal and affixed it to the side of the van. Environmental Services, Inc., it read, and in smaller letters, Cleaning up after the world. There was a phone number, too. If anyone rang it, they&#x2019;d get a pizzeria on U.S. 1. They fixed an identical decal to the opposite side of the van, then changed the license plates, tossing the old ones into the van.<br>Somebody looked under the hood, fiddled with a couple of things, then closed it. &#x201c;Good shape,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The man knows how to take care of a vehicle.&#x201d; He checked a sticker on the windshield. &#x201c;Had it serviced last week; nice of him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I hope his insurance is paid up,&#x201d; someone else said.<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; their leader said, &#x201c;let&#x2019;s go over it again.&#x201d; The poker chips and cards were removed from the big round table, and a large floor plan was spread out. &#x201c;Number two,&#x201d; the leader said, &#x201c;take us through it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We all know it by heart,&#x201d; somebody said.<br>&#x201c;You will when I&#x2019;m finished,&#x201d; the leader said. &#x201c;Then you can all get a good night&#x2019;s sleep.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>When the van was ready they went home and left him alone in the shed. He went to an elongated safe in a corner, tapped the combination into the keypad, and opened it. He removed six Remington riot guns&#x2014;12-gauge pump shotguns with 18�-inch barrels, normally used for police work&#x2014;and took them to the van, laying them on the floor. He went to a &nbsp;locker and removed six blue jumpsuits&#x2014;all the same size&#x2014;took them to the van and put one where each man would sit. Back to the locker to find six yellow construction hard hats, six dust masks and six pairs of tinted safety goggles, which he laid neatly on top of the jumpsuits. He then laid a shotgun on each seat, and placed a box of double-aught shells and a pair of latex surgical gloves beside each shotgun. Finally, he went back to the gun safe, removed six 9mm semiautomatic handguns and boxes of ammunition and distributed them inside the van. The weapons had been bought, one at a time, at gun shows or from unlicensed dealers, then stripped, inspected and, if necessary, repaired. Before reassembly, each part of each weapon had been washed clean with denatured alcohol and oiled. There would be no fingerprints or DNA samples on them.<br>When he was done, he sat down at the table, stripped off his gloves and poured himself a drink from a bottle of bourbon. He looked at the newspaper clipping again. Eleven o&#x2019;clock at the courthouse. &#x201c;Happy occasion,&#x201d; he said aloud to himself. &#x201c;And oh so convenient.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Two</b><br><br>HOLLY BARKER OPENED HER EYES AND FELT FOR Jackson. His side of the bed was empty, and she could hear the shower running. She moved her hand to the warm place on her stomach and found Daisy&#x2019;s head. She scratched behind an ear and was answered with a small sigh. Daisy was a Doberman pinscher, and she liked to sleep with her head on Holly&#x2019;s belly.<br>Holly heard the shower turn off and, a moment later, Jackson&#x2019;s bare feet padding across the bedroom carpet. She raised her head, tucked a pillow under it and eyed him&#x2014;naked, wet hair, in a hurry. She liked him naked.<br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;where am I going on my honeymoon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Same place as I am,&#x201d; Jackson replied, stepping into his boxer shorts and selecting a white shirt from a drawer.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m relieved to hear it,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And where is that?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Someplace you&#x2019;ll probably like,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;Probably&nbsp;like?

What if you screw up?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just have to take that chance.&#x201d; He pulled on his trousers, found a necktie and started to tie it.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re driving me crazy,&#x201d; she said, falling back onto the pillow.<br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t pull that sheet over your breasts, you&#x2019;re going to drive me crazy,&#x201d; he replied, looking at her in the mirror.<br>She kicked the sheet completely off, disturbing Daisy&#x2019;s sleep. &#x201c;Take that,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I intend to,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;when we arrive in . . . whatchacallit.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why are you rushing off ?&#x201d; she asked seductively.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t point that thing at me,&#x201d; Jackson said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a closing in half an hour, then I have to do some dictating before I leave the office and then, on the way to the courthouse, I have to pick up the tickets at the travel agent&#x2019;s and stop at the bank for some travelers&#x2019; checks.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you have the tickets sent here?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Because you would have ripped them open to find out where you&#x2019;re going on your honeymoon.&#x201d;<br>He had her there. She fumed.<br>He slipped into his suit jacket, adjusted his tie, came to the bed and bent over her.<br>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you dry your hair?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put the top down.&#x201d; He kissed her on one nipple, then the other.<br>She giggled. &#x201c;Sure the closing can wait a few minutes.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Would you muss my wedding dress?&#x201d; he asked. That was how he referred to the white linen suit he had had made for the occasion.<br>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re too beautiful.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Tell you what, if you&#x2019;ll call yourself Mrs. Oxenhandler for the rest of your life, I&#x2019;ll tell you where you&#x2019;re going on your honeymoon.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Jackson, I keep telling you:&nbsp;nobody&nbsp;would&nbsp;choose&nbsp;&nbsp;to be called Mrs. Oxenhandler.

They couldn&#x2019;t keep a straight face.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I think that&#x2019;s a very dignified name for a chief of police,&#x201d; Jackson said, trying to look hurt.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a very dignified name for someone who handles oxen,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; he sighed, &#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;ll find out where you&#x2019;re going on your honeymoon when you get there.&#x201d;<br>She pulled the sheet over her head. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t even tell me&nbsp;then!&#x201d; she cried. She pulled down the sheet again, and he was standing in the bedroom doorway, looking splendid in his new suit.<br>&#x201c;See you at the courthouse,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;In Judge Chandler&#x2019;s courtroom, and you&#x2019;d better be there early!&#x201d; she called after him. She fell back on the bed. She would always remember that picture of him, standing in the doorway in his white linen suit and gold tie, with his hair still wet.<br>Holly got out of bed, brushed her teeth and got into the shower, reaching for the shampoo. She had let her hair grow, and it was nearly down to her &nbsp;shoulders, though she wore it up when she was in uniform, which was most of the time. She was allowing herself two hours for the process&#x2014;washing, rolling and drying her hair, putting on a little makeup, which she rarely wore, and getting into the short white sheath that would be her wedding dress.<br>Daisy lay on the bathroom mat, watching her through the clear glass shower door, waiting patiently for her breakfast and to be let out. Holly laughed. Daisy would be her maid of honor; Holly had trained her to carry the bouquet all the way to the front of the courtroom before handing it to her. Daisy could do anything.<br>Holly felt that she could do anything, too. She was bursting with happiness and expectation and with trying to figure out where Jackson was taking her on her honeymoon.<br>She got out of the shower and called her office&#x2019;s direct line.<br>&#x201c;Chief Barker&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; her secretary and office manager, Helen Tubman, said.<br>&#x201c;Hi, it&#x2019;s me.

The esteem in which this monumental, lavishly illustrated work is universally held derives not only from its scholarship and creativity, but also from the rich literary style that exemplifies Thompson's great erudition in the physical and natural sciences, ancient and modern languages and the humanities.<br>The book begins with studies of organic magnitude, the rate of growth, cellular form and structure, adsorption, and the forms of tissues, then examines a vast spectrum of life forms, and concludes with a comparison of related forms that leads to the theory of transformations.</p><p></p></p><p>First published in 1917, <i>On Growth and Form</i> was at once revolutionary and conservative. Scottish embryologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860-1948) grew up in the newly cast shadow of Darwinism, and he took issue with some of the orthodoxies of the day--not because they were necessarily wrong, he said, but because they violated the spirit of Occam's razor, in which simple explanations are preferable to complex ones. In the case of such subjects as the growth of eggs, skeletons, and crystals, Thompson cited mathematical authority: these were matters of "economy and transformation," and they could be explained by laws governing surface tension and the like. (He doubtless would have enjoyed the study of fractals, which came after his time.) In <i>On Growth and Form</i>, he examines such matters as the curve of frequency or bell curve (which explains variations in height among 10-year-old schoolboys, the florets of a daisy, the distribution of darts on a cork board, the thickness of stripes along a zebra's flanks, the shape of mountain ranges and sand dunes) and spirals (which turn up everywhere in nature you look: in the curve of a seashell, the swirl of water boiling in a saucepan, the sweep of faraway nebulae, the twist of a strand of DNA, the turns of the labyrinth in which the legendary Minotaur lived out its days). The result is an astonishingly varied book that repays skimming and close reading alike. English biologist Sir Peter Medawar called Thompson's tome "beyond comparison the finest work of literature in all the annals of science that have been recorded in the English tongue." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Why do living things and physical phenomena take the forms they do? Analyzing the mathematical and physical aspects of biological processes, this historic work, first published in 1917, has become renowned as well for the poetry of is descriptions.</p><h2>Suite for Barbara Loden</h2><p>Fiction. Translated from the French by Natasha Lehrer and C�cile Menon. "I believe there is a miracle in <em>Wanda</em>," wrote Marguerite Duras of the only film American actress Barbara Loden ever wrote and directed. "Usually, there is a distance between representation and text, subject and action. Here that distance is completely eradicated." It is perhaps this "miracle"&#x2015;the seeming collapse of fiction and fact&#x2015;that has made <em>Wanda</em> (1970) a subject of fascination for artists from Isabelle Huppert to Rachel Kushner to Kate Zambreno, and that set acclaimed French writer Nathalie L�ger on an obsessive quest across continents, into archives, and through mining towns of Pennsylvania trying to get closer to the film and its maker. SUITE FOR BARBARA LODEN is the magnificent result. Moving contrapuntally between biography and auto-fiction, film criticism and anecdote, fact and speculation, SUITE FOR BARBARA LODEN is a stunning meditation on knowledge and self-knowledge, on the surfaces of life and art, and how we come to truth&#x2015;a kind of truth&#x2015;not through facts alone but through acts of the imagination.</p><p>Nathalie L�ger is an award-winning French author, as well as an editor, archivist, and curator. SUITE FOR BARBARA LODEN won the prestigious Prix du livre Inter 2012, voted for by readers across France."Here, now, is a remarkable new book that does everything&#x2015;biography, criticism, film history, memoir, and even fiction, all at once, all out in front...In her combination of the conversational and the incantatory, the fragmentary and the infinite, L�ger captures something of [Marguerite] Duras's own tones and moods, yet her approach to Loden and her appreciation of 'Wanda' are entirely her own."&#x2015;<strong>The New Yorker</strong><br><br>"Assigned to write the entry about <em>Wanda</em> (1970), Barbara Loden's art-house movie, for a film encyclopedia, L�ger let herself get lost. The result gracefully melds criticism, fiction, and autobiography, and is a powerful example of how summary, channeled through the most personal of perspectives, can be a form of art."&#x2015;<strong>Harper's Magazine</strong><br><br>"When I set out to review <em>Suite for Barbara Loden</em>, I realized I didn't have much to say, exactly, beyond what L�ger says. I wanted to show how she shows how one woman's experience is filtered through another, collapses into another. And I wanted to show how we (women) connect with Wanda&#x2015;even extraordinary, glamorous, intellectual women like L�ger or Loden, and even women generations younger than Wanda, like myself&#x2015;how the book sucks in every woman who approaches it."&#x2015;<strong>The Rumpus</strong><br><br>"What is initially L�ger's explicit hesitance to create a biography that does not do Loden justice is transformed into her own story, one of how the lives of women seep into one another."&#x2015;<strong>Los Angeles Review of Books</strong><br><br>"[A] beautiful and intimate mixed portrait of Loden, <em>Wanda</em>, and L�ger."&#x2015;<strong>Small Press Book Review</strong><br><br>"Moving descriptions of Loden's performance in <em>Wanda</em> dot the narration as L�ger struggles to reveal joy or pain Loden may have hidden, beyond her early work as a pin-up girl, her marriage to Elia Kazan, and a 1964 Tony Award for her role in Arthur Miller's <em>After the Fall</em>. Translators Lehrer and Menon give L�ger's voice immense verve in English as her small task becomes an obsession."&#x2015;<strong>Kirkus Reviews</strong><br><br>"I am not a movie buff&#x2015;in fact, I rarely watch movies, especially the 'important' ones&#x2015;but I realize I love reading descriptions of film scenes. There's a kind of inert vividness to these descriptions, a scrim between me and the dramatic moment, that I find almost erotic. L�ger intersperses descriptions of <em>Wanda</em> with passages about how she came to know this movie, how she tried and tried to understand Barbara Loden herself. Woven into these, too, are autobiographical asides. One begins: 'Once upon a time the man I loved reproached me for my apparent passivity with other men.' The result of these combined fragments is delicious and mysterious.&#x201d;&#x2015;Edan Lepucki, "My Year in Reading," <strong>The Millions</strong><br><br>"L�ger jump-cuts through time and space with the expertise of a movie director."&#x2015;<strong>Joanna Walsh, author of <em>Vertigo</em></strong><br><br>"I hope this book inspires a new hybrid form of film criticism, where private excavation is also cooperative creativity."&#x2015;Brad Johnson, Diesel Books (<strong>The Literary Hub</strong> "Great Bookseller Fall 2016 Preview")<br><br>"In <em>Suite for Barbara Loden</em>, L�ger enacts a kind of double excavation in her desire 'to excavate a miniature model of modernity' that is Barbara Loden, an unearthing that has no teleological endpoint because it continues beyond the scope of the text being written. This excavation, indeed, must engage with the many texts that inform it, shaping the journey and, in effect, refracting the writing subject back on to herself&#x2015;a fantasmatic act of the other becoming the self."&#x2015;<strong>Music &amp; Literature</strong></p><h2>Seductive Poison: A Jonestown Survivor&#39;s Story of Life and Death in the Peoples Temple</h2><p><b>In this haunting and riveting firsthand account, a survivor of Jim Jones's Peoples Temple opens up the shadowy world of cults and shows how anyone can fall under their spell. </b><br><br>A high-level member of Jim Jones's Peoples Temple for seven years, Deborah Layton escaped his infamous commune in the Guyanese jungle, leaving behind her mother, her older brother, and many friends. She returned to the United States with warnings of impending disaster, but her pleas for help fell on skeptical ears, and shortly thereafter, in November 1978, the Jonestown massacre shocked the world. <i>Seductive Poison</i> is both an unflinching historical document and a suspenseful story of intrigue, power, and murder.</p><p>Deborah Layton was, by her own account, a typical rebellious youth, with nothing in her dossier to indicate that she would eventually find herself in Jim Jones's People's Temple in Guyana, looking for a way out of the green hell that had become the People's Temple Agricultural Project. She barely escaped in June 1978. Within months, more than 900 people drank Jones's cyanide punch and committed "revolutionary suicide" in the face of mounting stateside pressure on the cult, some of it prompted by Layton's own testimonials upon her safe return home. Her brother, Larry, also survived, and as one of the few left alive in Guyana became a scapegoat for Jones's crimes; he is now serving a life sentence in federal prison. <p> There is a simple naivet� at the root of <i>Seductive Poison</i>. Layton's own youthful innocence, foremost, but also the desire to trust another person, the need for belonging and meaning, which led so many perfectly normal Americans to place their faith in a suicidal madman. Far from confirming the simplistically monstrous Jones of the public imagination, Layton paints the man as a dark, twisted shaman, by turns soothing, then suddenly malevolent and petty, with a hugely sadistic streak that belied his perfectly coifed hair, expensive suits, and impressive political connections. The scenes in which she describes her escape and flight to safety are wrenching, her last-minute conversation with Jones and his seductive appeal for her to return home to Jonestown are chilling, and her fear and indecision are still palpable on the printed page. For Layton to recount tales this personal and horrifying must have been tremendously difficult. For her to lift those recollections above the bargain-basement freak-show reputation the People's Temple has achieved in the popular imagination and depict them with the power of great tragedy is nothing but extraordinary. <i>--Tjames Madison</i></p>Told by a former high-level member of the Peoples Temple and Jonestown survivor, Seductive Poison is the "truly unforgettable" ("Kirkus Review) story of how one woman was seduced by one of the most notorious cults in recent memory and how she found her way back to sanity. <br>From Waco to Heaven's Gate, the past decade has seen its share of cult tragedies. But none has been quite so dramatic or compelling as the Jonestown massacre of 1978, in which the Reverend Jim Jones and 913 of his disciples perished. Deborah Layton had been a member of the Peoples Temple for seven years when she departed for Jonestown, Guyana, the promised land nestled deep in the South American jungle. When she arrived, however, Layton saw that something was seriously wrong. Jones constantly spoke of a revolutionary mass suicide, and Layton knew only too well that he had enough control over the minds of the Jonestown residents to carry it out. But her pleas for help--and her sworn affidavit to the U.S. government--fell on skeptical ears. In this very personal account, Layton opens up the shadowy world of cults and shows how anyone can fall under their spell. Seductive Poison is both an unflinching historical document and a riveting story of intrigue, power, and murder.</p><h2>Documentary: A History of the Non-Fiction Film</h2><p>Now brought completely up to date, the new edition of this classic work on documentary films and filmmaking surveys the history of the genre from 1895 to the present day. With the myriad social upheavals over the past decade, documentaries have enjoyed an international renaissance; here Barnouw considers the medium in the light of an entirely new political and social climate. He examines as well the latest filmmaking technology, and the effects that video cassettes and cable television are having on the production of documentaries. And like the previous editions, <em>Documentary</em> is filled with photographs, many of them rare, collected during the author's travels around the world. Covering the full course of the documentary from Louis Lumiere's first effort to recent landmark productions such as <em>Shoah</em>, this book makes the growing importance of a unique blend of art and reality accessible and understandable to all film lovers.<br></p><p><br><strong>Erik Barnouw</strong>, now retired, was Chief of the Library of Congress's Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division, and long headed Columbia University's film division.

Rejecting the theory that some knowledge is innate in us, Locke argues that it derives from sense perceptions and experience, as analysed and developed by reason. While defending these central claims with vigorous common sense, Locke offers many incidental - and highly influential - reflections on space and time, meaning, free will and personal identity. The result is a powerful, pioneering work, which, together with Descartes's works, largely set the agenda for modern philosophy.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

However, his interests lay in medicine and the new experimental sciences and in 1667 he became personal physician to the Earl of Shaftesbury. Under the influence of Shaftesbury, Locke developed his ideas on politics, property, trade, monarchy and the mind. Shaftesbury became a bitter opponent of Charles II and was involved in the plot of 1683. This forced Locke to flee in exile to Holland, but he returned after 1688 and began to publish his most famous works. He wrote also on ethology, education, and in defense of religious tolerance, while founding the analytic philosophy of the mind.</p><h2>Ten Myths About Israel</h2><p><b>The myths&#x2014;and reality&#x2014;behind the state of Israel<br><br></b>In this groundbreaking book, published on the fiftieth anniversary of the Occupation, the outspoken and radical Israeli historian Ilan Pappe examines the most contested ideas concerning the origins and identity of the contemporary state of Israel.<br><br>The &#x201c;ten myths&#x201d; that Pappe explores&#x2014;repeated endlessly in the media, enforced by the military, accepted without question by the world&#x2019;s governments&#x2014;reinforce the regional status quo. He explores the claim that Palestine was an empty land at the time of the Balfour Declaration, as well as the formation of Zionism and its role in the early decades of nation building. He asks whether the Palestinians voluntarily left their homeland in 1948, and whether June 1967 was a war of &#x201c;no choice.&#x201d; Turning to the myths surrounding the failures of the Camp David Accords and the official reasons for the attacks on Gaza, Pappe explains why the two-state solution is no longer viable.</p><p><b>Ilan Pappe</b> is an Israeli historian and socialist activist.

And so Brettler unpacks the literary conventions, ideological assumptions, and historical conditions that inform the biblical text and demonstrates how modern critical scholarship and archaeological discoveries shed light on this fascinating and complex literature.<br> Brettler surveys representative biblical texts from different genres to illustrate how modern can read these texts. He guides us in reading the Bible as it was read in the biblical period, independent of later religious norms and interpretive traditions. Understanding the Bible this way lets us appreciate it as an interesting text that speaks in multiple voices on profound issues.<br> Although the emphasis of <em>How to Read the Jewish Bible</em> is on showing contemporary Jews, as well as Christians, how they can relate to the Bible in a more meaningful way, readers at any level of religious faith can benefit greatly from this comprehensive but remarkably clear guide to interpreting the Jewish Bible.<br></p><p><br><strong>Marc Brettler</strong> is Dora Golding Professor of Biblical Literature and chair of the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University.

I highly recommend his work."--The Reporter<br><br>"Brettler is clearly a master, and his book should be the first choice for any non-specialist interested in the field."--Jbooks.com<br><br>"Brettler examines the historical context--the conventions and ideology--that prevailed at the time the biblical scriptures were written. His approach underscores the literary workings of the text, and ties biblical stories to specific events. With its emphasis on the historical-critical<br>method, How to Read the Bible provides insight into the history of the Jewish Bible as well as that of Israel itself. The book has been hailed for its relevance to scholars and casual students alike."--Terry Gross, Fresh Air, National Public Radio<br><br>"As a professor of biblical studies, I am frequently sent textbooks...and I often consult academic introductions to the field as well. None of them is as clear, sophisticated, and readable as this book. For Jewish and non-Jewish readers.... The book's accomplishments remain stellar."--Benjamin<br>D. Sommer, Sh'ma/Koret Book Review</p><h2>Rights of Man, Common Sense, and Other Political Writings (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Thomas Paine was the first international revolutionary. His <em>Common Sense</em> (1776) was the most widely read pamphlet of the American Revolution--and his <em>Rights of Man</em> (1791-2), the most famous defense of the French Revolution, sent out a clarion call for revolution throughout the world. Paine paid the price for his principles: he was outlawed in Britain, narrowly escaped execution in France, and was vilified as an atheist and a Jacobin on his return to America.<br>This new edition contains the complete texts of both <em>Rights of Man</em> and <em>Common Sense</em>, as well as six other powerfully political writings--<em>American Crisis I</em>, <em>American Crisis XIII</em>, <em>Agrarian Justice</em>, <em>Letter to Jefferson</em>, <em>Letter Addressed to the Addressers on the Late Proclamation</em>, and <em>Dissertation on</em> <em>the First Principles of Government</em>--all of which illustrate why Paine's ideas still resonate in the modern welfare states of today.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Using the imagery above, I tried to picture what happens when the truth of Christ penetrates our hearts, melts our assumptions, and propels us on a journey of abandonment to God.<br><br>But you and I are not intended to plunge down the mountain of radical obedience alone. That&#x2019;s one of the reasons I love this imagery of the Amazon. The force of a single drop of water descending the Andes is minuscule. Similarly, as long as individual Christians journey alone&#x2014;no matter how &#x201c;radical&#x201d; they are&#x2014;their effect will be minimal. But as men and women who are surrendered to the person of Christ join together in churches that are committed to the purpose of Christ, then nothing can stop the spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth.<br><br>In <i>Radical Together</i>, I want to consider what happens&#x2014;or can happen&#x2014;when we apply the revolutionary claims and commands of Christ to our communities of faith. I want to contemplate the force of a people who come together to enjoy God&#x2019;s grace in the church while they extend God&#x2019;s glory in the world. And I want to propose that a movement of such people in such churches has the potential to permeate nations with the praise of God.<br><br>I am speaking to believers who are ready to lead, influence, or simply be a part of such a movement in their local church. You may be a follower of Christ who desires to live out a more biblical gospel, and you want to see your church do the same. You may be a pastor, staff person, or leader of some other description in the church, and you want your local fellowship to count for the spread of God&#x2019;s glory in the world. You may even be a Christian who is tempted to throw in the towel and say, &#x201c;My church will never be radical.&#x201d;<br><br>Whatever your circumstance, in this book I invite you to engage God&#x2019;s Word and God&#x2019;s world with a fresh, honest, and<br>open perspective so that together we might answer one question:<br><br>How can we in the church best unleash the people of God in the Spirit of God with the Word of God for the glory of God in the world?<br><br>As I pose this question, I do not claim to be an expert on how to answer it. I am merely one pastor in one church, and I have so much to learn. Yet I know that, as leaders and members of churches, we are called to spur one another toward Christ and his agenda in the world. And I am convinced that in the church we can&#x2014;unknowingly and unintentionally&#x2014;actually prevent God&#x2019;s people from accomplishing God&#x2019;s purpose. If we are not careful, our activities in the church can hinder the advancement of Christ&#x2019;s kingdom. For this reason I believe certain ideas are foundational<br>for Christians who desire to be a part of churches that are unleashing people into the world with the gospel.<br><br>This book is organized around six such ideas. I do not claim they are exhaustive, but as a pastor working out the implications of the gospel in a local church, I do believe these ideas are essential. Here&#x2019;s a preview:<br><br>1. One of the worst enemies of Christians can be good things in the church.<br>2. The gospel that saves us from work saves us to work.<br>3. The Word does the work.<br>4. Building the right church depends on using all the wrong people.<br>5. We are living&#x2014;and longing&#x2014;for the end of the world.<br>6. We are selfless followers of a self-centered God.<br><br>At first glance these ideas may seem fanciful, even untrue. I understand that. But then many of Jesus&#x2019; statements struck his listeners that way too. Statements like these: &#x201c;Many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first,&#x201d; &#x201c;It is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.&#x201d; Though I certainly don&#x2019;t claim the authority or creativity of Jesus, my aim is to put forward ideas that at first may seem confusing, if not contradictory, but upon deeper investigation will<br>bring to light important realities that most overlook.<br><br>I hope and pray that accurate theological foundations undergird all my practical exhortations. I am grateful for valuable resources that help us understand the nature and marks of the church. But I want to be clear that my goal here is not to present a comprehensive overview of the church. Instead, it is to build upon biblical foundations in order to consider practical implications for how a right understanding of the church fuels radical obedience among Christians.<br><br>Throughout the history of humankind, God has chosen to call out not just individuals but a people for himself. He told the Israelites, &#x201c;I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be my people.&#x201d; Through Christ, God brought Jews and Gentiles together as &#x201c;one body&#x201d; in which &#x201c;each member belongs to all the others.&#x201d; Peter told the church, &#x201c;You are a chosen people,...a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.&#x201d; Indeed, God&#x2019;s intention is that &#x201c;through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms.&#x201d;<br><br>If you and I want our lives to count for God&#x2019;s purpose in the world, we need to begin with a commitment to God&#x2019;s people in the church. God has called us to lock arms with one another in single-minded, death-defying obedience to one objective: the declaration of his gospel for the demonstration of his glory to all nations. This is God&#x2019;s design for his people, and it is worth giving our lives to see it accomplished. It is worth it for billions of people who do not yet know that Jesus is the grave-conquering, lifegiving, all-satisfying King. And it is worth it for you and me, because we were made to enjoy the great pleasures of God in the context of total abandonment to his global purpose.</p><h2>A Druid&#39;s Herbal for the Sacred Earth Year</h2><p>For the ancient Druids, the healing and magical properties of herbs were inseparable from the larger cycles of the seasons, the movements of the planets, and the progression of a human life. <br><br><i>A Druid&#x2019;s Herbal </i>shows the reader how to use herbs when creating rituals to celebrate festivals and significant life passages such as births, house blessings, weddings, funerals, and naming ceremonies. <br><br>Drawing on extensive research and a deep personal experience with Pagan traditions, Ellen Evert Hopman explores the history and folklore surrounding the eight major Celtic festivals: Samhain, Winter Solstice, Imbolc, Spring Equinox, Beltaine, Summer Solstice, Lugnasad, and Fall Equinox.

Morning mist, thick as smoke, hung over the lake, and the trees beyond her window drifted in and out of focus. Another gunshot rang out, closer this time. Since first light, she'd heard the gunfire, and would probably hear it all day until dusk, because it was the first day of November. The start of hunting season. Somewhere in those woods, a man with a rifle was tramping around half-blind through the mist as imagined shadows of white-tailed deer danced around him.<br><br>"I don't think you should wait outside for the bus," said Claire. "I'll drive you to school."<br><br>Noah, hunched at the breakfast table, said nothing. He scooped up another spoonful of Cheerios and slurped it down. Fourteen years old, and her son still ate like a two-year-old, milk splashing on the table, crumbs of toast littering the floor around his chair. He ate without looking at her, as though to meet her gaze was to come face to face with Medusa. And what difference would it make if he did look at me, she thought wryly. My darling son has already turned to stone.<br><br>She said again, "I'll drive you to school, Noah."<br><br>"That's okay. I'm taking the bus." He stood up and grabbed his backpack and skateboard.<br><br>"Those hunters out there can't possibly see what they're shooting at. At least wear the orange hat. So they won't think you're a deer."<br><br>"But it looks so dorky."<br><br>"You can take it off on the bus. Just put it on now." She took the knit cap from the mitten shelf and held it out to him.<br><br>He looked at it, then finally, at her. He had sprouted up several inches in just one year, and they were now the same height, their gazes meeting straight on, neither one able to claim the advantage. She wondered if Noah was as acutely aware of their new physical equality as she was. Once she could hug him and a child would hug back. Now the child was gone, his softness resculpted into muscle, his face narrowed to a sharp new angularity.<br><br>"Please," she said, still holding out the cap.<br><br>At last he sighed and jammed the cap over his dark hair. She had to suppress a smile; he did look dorky.<br><br>He had already started down the hallway when she called out: "Good-bye kiss?"<br><br>With a look of exasperation, he turned to give her the barest peck on the cheek, and then he was out of the door.<br><br>No hugs anymore, she thought ruefully as she stood at the window and watched him trudge toward the road. It's all grunts and shrugs and awkward silences.<br><br>He stopped beneath the maple tree at the end of the driveway, pulled off the cap, and stood with his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched against the cold. No jacket, just a thin gray sweatshirt against a thirty-seven-degree morning. It was cool to be cold. She had to resist the urge to run outside and bundle him into a coat.<br><br>Claire waited until the school bus appeared. She watched her son climb aboard without a backward glance, saw his silhouette move down the aisle and take a seat beside another student -- a girl. Who is that girl? she wondered. I don't know the names of my son's friends anymore. I've shrunk to just a small corner of his universe. She knew this was supposed to happen, the pulling away, the child's struggle for independence, but she was not prepared for it. The transformation had occurred suddenly, as though a sweet boy had walked out of the house one day, and a stranger had walked back in. <i>You're all I have left of Peter. I'm not ready to lose you as well.</i><br><br>The bus rumbled away.<br><br>Claire returned to the kitchen and sat down to her cup of lukewarm coffee. The house felt hollow and silent, a home still in mourning. She sighed and unrolled the weekly <i>Tranquility Gazette.</i> HEALTHY DEER HERD PROMISES BOUNTIFUL HARVEST, announced the front page. The hunt was on. Thirty days to bag your deer.<br><br>Outside, another gunshot echoed in the woods.<br><br>She turned the page to the police blotter. There was no mention yet of last night's Halloween disturbance, or of the seven rowdy teenagers who'd been arrested for taking their annual trick-or-treating too far. But there, buried among the reports of lost dogs and stolen firewood, was her name, under VIOLATIONS: "Claire Elliot, age forty, operating vehicle with expired safety sticker." She still hadn't brought the Subaru in for its safety inspection; today she'd have to drive the truck instead, just to avoid getting another citation. Irritably she flipped to the next page and was scanning the day's weather forecast -- cold and windy, high in the thirties, low in the twenties -- when the telephone rang.<br><br>She rose to answer it. "Hello?"<br><br>"Dr. Elliot? This is Rachel Sorkin out on Toddy Point Road. I've got something of an emergency out here. Elwyn just shot himself."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"You know, that idiot Elwyn Clyde. He came trespassing on my property, chasing after some poor deer. Killed it too -- a beautiful doe, right in my front yard. These stupid men and their stupid guns."<br><br>"What about Elwyn?"<br><br>"Oh, he tripped and shot his own foot. Serves him right."<br><br>"He should go straight to the hospital."<br><br>"Well you see, that's the problem. He doesn't want to go to the hospital, and he won't let me call an ambulance. He wants me to drive him and the deer home. Well, I'm not going to. So what should I do with him?"<br><br>"How badly is he bleeding?"<br><br>She heard Rachel call out: "Hey, Elwyn? <i>Elwyn!</i> Are you bleeding?" Then Rachel came back on the line. "He says he's fine. He just wants a ride home. But I'm not taking him, and I'm certainly not taking the deer."<br><br>Claire sighed. "I guess I can drive over and take a look. You're on Toddy Point Road?"<br><br>"About a mile past the Boulders. My name's on the mail box."<br><br>The mist was starting to lift as Claire turned her pickup truck onto Toddy Point Road. Through stands of white pine, she caught glimpses of Locust Lake, the fog rising like steam. Already beams of sunlight were breaking through, splashing gold onto the rippling water. Across the lake, just visible through fingers of mist, was the north shore with its summer cottages, most of them boarded up for the season, their wealthy owners gone home to Boston or New York. On the south shore, where Claire now drove, were the more modest homes, some of them little more than two-room shacks tucked in among the trees.<br><br>She drove past the Boulders, an outcropping of granite stones where the local teenagers gathered to swim in the summertime, and spotted the mailbox with the name <i>Sorkin.</i><br><br>A bumpy dirt road brought her to the house. It was a strange and whimsical structure, rooms added haphazardly, corners jutting out in unexpected places. Rising above it all, like the tip of a crystal breaking through the roof, was a glassed-in belfry. An eccentric woman would have an eccentric house, and Rachel Sorkin was one of Tranquility's odd birds, a striking, black-haired woman who strode once a week into town, swathed in a purple hooded cape. This looked like a house in which a caped woman might reside.<br><br>By the front steps, next to a neatly tended herb garden, lay the dead deer.<br><br>Claire climbed out of her truck. At once two dogs bounded out of the woods and barred her way, barking and growling. Guarding the kill, she realized.<br><br>Rachel came out of the house and yelled at the dogs: "Get out of here, you bloody animals! Go home!" She grabbed a broom from the porch and came tearing down the steps, long black hair flying, the broom thrust forward like a lance.<br><br>The dogs backed away.<br><br>"Ha! Cowards," said Rachel, lunging at them with the broom. They retreated toward the woods.<br><br>"Hey, you leave my dogs alone!" shouted Elwyn Clyde, who had limped out onto the porch. Elwyn was a prime example of an evolutionary dead end: a fifty-year-old lump bundled in flannel, and doomed to eternal bachelorhood. "They're not hurtin' nothin'. They're just watchin' after my deer."<br><br>"Elwyn, I got news for you. You killed this poor creature on my property. So she's mine."<br><br>"What you gonna do with a deer? Blasted vegetarian!"<br><br>Claire cut in: "How's the foot, Elwyn?"<br><br>He looked it Claire and blinked, as though surprised to see her. "I tripped," he said. "No big deal."<br><br>"A bullet wound is always a big deal. May I take a look at it?"<br><br>"Can't pay you..." He paused, one scraggly eyebrow lifting as a sly thought occurred. "'Less you want some venison."<br><br>"I just want to make sure you're not bleeding to death. We can settle up some other time. Can I look at your foot?"<br><br>"If you really want to," he said, and limped back into the house.<br><br>"This should be a treat," said Rachel.<br><br>It was warm inside the kitchen. Rachel threw a birch log into the wood stove, and sweet smoke puffed out as she dropped the cast iron lid back in place.<br><br>"Let's see the foot," said Claire.<br><br>Elwyn hobbled over to a chair, leaving smears of blood on the floor. He had his sock on, and there was it jagged hole at the top, near the big toe, as though a rat had chewed through the wool. "Hardly bothering me," he said. "Not worth all this fuss, if you ask me."<br><br>Claire knelt clown and peeled off the sock. It came away slowly, the wool matted to his foot not by blood but by sweat and dead skin.<br><br>"Oh God," said Rachel, cupping her hand over her nose. "Don't you ever change your socks, Elwyn?"<br><br>The bullet had passed through the fleshy web between the first and second toe. Claire found the exit wound underneath the foot. There was only a little blood oozing out now. Trying not to gag on the smell, she tested movement of all the toes, and determined that no nerves had been damaged.<br><br>"You'll have to clean it and change the bandages every day," she said. "And you need a tetanus shot, Elwyn."<br><br>"Oh, I got one of them already."<br><br>"When?"<br><br>"Last year, from ol' Doc Pomeroy After I shot myself."<br><br>"Is this an annual event?"<br><br>"That one went through my other foot. 'Tweren't a big deal."<br><br>Dr. Pomeroy had died back in January, and Claire had acquired all his old medical records when she'd bought the practice from his estate eight months ago. She could check Elwyn's file and confirm the date of his last tetanus shot.<br><br>"I guess it's up to me to clean that foot," said Rachel.<br><br>Claire took out a small bottle of Betadine from her medical bag and handed it to her. "Add that to a warm bucket of water. Let him soak in it for a while."<br><br>"Oh, I can do that myself," said Elwyn, and got up.<br><br>"Then we might as well just amputate right now!" snapped Rachel. "Sit <i>down,</i> Elwyn."<br><br>"Gee," he said, and sat down.<br><br>Claire left a few packets of bandages and gauze wrappings on the table. "Elwyn, you come into my office next week, so I can check the wound."<br><br>"But I got too much to do -- "<br><br>"If you don't come in, I'll have to hunt you down like a dog."<br><br>He blinked at her in surprise. "Yes, ma'am," he said meekly.<br><br>Suppressing a smile, Claire picked up her medical bag and walked out of the house.<br><br>The two dogs were in the front yard again, fighting over a filthy bone. As Claire came down the steps, they both spun around to stare at her.<br><br>The black one trotted forward and growled.<br><br>"Shoo," Claire said, but the dog refused to back down. It took another few steps forward, teeth bared.<br><br>The tan dog, spotting opportunity, snatched the bone in its teeth and began dragging away the prize. It got halfway across the yard before the black dog suddenly noticed the thief and streaked back into the fight. Yelping and growling, they thrashed around the yard in a tangle of black and tan. The bone lay, forgotten, beside Claire's pickup truck.<br><br>She opened the door and was just sliding in behind the steering wheel when the image registered in her brain. She looked down at the ground, at the bone.<br><br>It was less than a foot long, and stained a rusty brown with dirt. One end had broken off, leaving jagged splinters. The other end was intact, the bony landmarks recognizable.<br><br>It was a femur. And it was human.<br><br>Ten miles out of town, Tranquility Police Chief Lincoln Kelly finally caught up with his wife.<br><br>She was doing about fifty in a stolen Chevy, weaving left and right, the loose tailpipe kicking up sparks every time she hit a dip in the road.<br><br>"Man oh man," said Floyd Spear, sitting beside Lincoln in the cruiser. "Doreen got her snookerful today."<br><br>"I've been on the road all morning," said Lincoln. "Didn't get a chance to check up on her." He turned on the siren, hoping that would induce Doreen to slow down. She sped up.<br><br>"Now what?" asked Floyd. "Want me to call for backup?"<br><br>Backup meant Hank Dorr, the only other officer on patrol duty that morning.<br><br>"No," said Lincoln. "Let's see if we can't talk her into pulling over."<br><br>"At sixty miles an hour?"<br><br>"Get on the bullhorn."<br><br>0 Floyd picked up the mike and his voice boomed out over the speaker: "Hey, Doreen, pull over! C'mon, Sweetheart, you're gonna hurt someone!"<br><br>The Chevy just kept dipping and weaving.<br><br>"We could wait till she runs out of gas," Floyd suggested.<br><br>"Keep talking to her."<br><br>Floyd tried the mike again. "Doreen, Lincoln's here! C'mon, Sweetheart, pull over! He wants ta 'pologize!<br><br>"I want to <i>what?"</i><br><br>"Pull over, Doreen, and he'll tell you himself!"<br><br>"What in hell are you talking about?" said Lincoln.<br><br>"Women always expect a man to apologize."<br><br>"But I didn't do anything!"<br><br>Up ahead, the Chevy's brake lights suddenly lit up.<br><br>"See?" said Floyd as the Chevy rolled to a stop at the side of the road.<br><br>Lincoln pulled up behind it and climbed out of the cruiser.<br><br>Doreen sat hunched behind the steering wheel, her red hair wild and tangled, her hands shaking. Lincoln opened the door, reached over his wife's lap, and removed the car keys. "Doreen," he said wearily, "you gotta come back to the station."<br><br>"When are you coming home, Lincoln?" she asked.<br><br>"We'll talk about that later. Come on, Honey, let's get in the cruiser." He reached for her elbow but she shook him off and slapped his hand for good measure.<br><br>"I just want to know when you're coming home," she said.<br><br>"We've talked about this and talked about this."<br><br>"You're still married to me. You're still my husband."<br><br>"And there's just no point in talking about it any more." Again he took her elbow. He already had her out of the Chevy when she hauled off and slugged him in the jaw. He staggered back a few steps, his whole head ringing.<br><br>"Hey!" said Floyd, grabbing Doreen's arms. "Hey now, you don't wanna go doing that!"<br><br>"Lemme go!" screeched Doreen. She broke out of Floyd's grasp and took another swing at her husband.<br><br>This time Lincoln ducked, which only made his wife madder. She got in one more swing before Lincoln and Floyd managed to get her arms secured.<br><br>"I hate to do this," said Lincoln. "But you're just not being reasonable today." He snapped the handcuffs on her wrists. She spat at him. He wiped his sleeve across his face, then patiently guided his wife into the backseat of the cruiser.<br><br>"Oh man," said Floyd. "You know we're gonna have to book her."<br><br>"I know." Lincoln sighed and slid in behind the wheel.<br><br>"You can't divorce me, Lincoln Kelly!" said Doreen. "You promised to love and cherish!"<br><br>"I didn't know about the bottle," said Lincoln, and he turned the car around.<br><br>They drove at a leisurely speed toward town, Doreen cussing a purple streak the whole time.

It was a time of magic and mysticism that saw a vital resurgence of interest in the occult and a creative intensity not seen in the West since the Renaissance. This was the time of the God-Seekers, pilgrims of the soul and explorers of the spirit who sought the salvation of the world through art and ideas. These sages and their visions of Holy Russia are returning to prominence now through Russian president Vladimir Putin, who, inspired by their ideas, envisions a new &#x201c;Eurasian&#x201d; civilization with Russia as its leader. <br><br>Exploring Russia&#x2019;s long history of mysticism and apocalyptic thought, Gary Lachman examines Russia&#x2019;s unique position between East and West and its potential role in the future of the world. Lachman discusses Russia&#x2019;s original Slavic paganism and its eager adoption of mystical and apocalyptic Eastern Orthodox Christianity. He explores the Silver Age and its &#x201c;occult revival&#x201d; with a look at Rasputin&#x2019;s prophecies, Blavatsky&#x2019;s Theosophy, Roerich&#x2019;s &#x201c;Red Shambhala,&#x201d; and the philosophies of Berdyaev and Solovyov. He looks at Russian Rosicrucianism, the Illuminati Scare, Russian Freemasonry, and the rise of other secret societies in Russia. He explores the Russian character as that of the &#x201c;holy fool,&#x201d; as seen in the great Russian literature of the 19th century, especially Dostoyevsky. He also examines the psychic research performed by the Russian government throughout the 20th century and the influence of Evola and the esoteric right on the spiritual and political milieus in Russia. <br><br>Through in-depth exploration of the philosophies that inspire Putin&#x2019;s political regime and a look at Russia&#x2019;s unique cultural identity, Lachman ponders what they will mean for the future of Russia and the world. What drives the Russian soul to pursue the apocalypse? Will these philosophers lead Russia to dominate the world, or will they lead it into a new cultural epoch centered on spiritual power and mystical wisdom?</p><p>Gary Lachman is an author and lecturer on consciousness, counterculture, and the Western esoteric tradition.

The antinomian says, &#39;Ah, this gospel is a wonderful message of salvation by the free grace of God. Therefore, it doesn&#39;t matter at all how you live as a believer; you are saved once and forever.&#39; The Apostle shows us why some people have misused the doctrine of the grace of God in that way, and explains why Christians - &#39;the servants of righteousness&#39; - must not live in sin or let sin reign within.</p><p>Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981) was born in Wales.

Operating in Chicago&#x2019;s notorious Levee district at the dawn of the last century, the Club&#x2019;s proprietors, two aristocratic sisters named Minna and Ada Everleigh, welcomed moguls and actors, senators and athletes, foreign dignitaries and literary icons, into their stately double mansion, where thirty stunning Everleigh &#x201c;butterflies&#x201d; awaited their arrival. Courtesans named Doll, Suzy Poon Tang, and Brick Top devoured raw meat to the delight of Prince Henry of Prussia and recited poetry for Theodore Dreiser. Whereas lesser madams pocketed most of a harlot&#x2019;s earnings and kept a &#x201c;whipper&#x201d; on staff to mete out discipline, the Everleighs made sure their girls dined on gourmet food, were examined by an honest physician, and even tutored in the literature of Balzac.<br><br>Not everyone appreciated the sisters&#x2019; attempts to elevate the industry. Rival Levee madams hatched numerous schemes to ruin the Everleighs, including an attempt to frame them for the death of department store heir Marshall Field, Jr. But the sisters&#x2019; most daunting foes were the Progressive Era reformers, who sent the entire country into a frenzy with lurid tales of &#x201c;white slavery&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x2014;the allegedly rampant practice of kidnapping young girls and forcing them into brothels. This furor shaped America&#x2019;s sexual culture and had repercussions all the way to the White House, including the formation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<br><br>With a cast of characters that includes Jack Johnson, John Barrymore, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., William Howard Taft, &#x201c;Hinky Dink&#x201d; Kenna, and Al Capone, Sin in the Second City is Karen Abbott&#x2019;s colorful, nuanced portrait of the iconic Everleigh sisters, their world-famous Club, and the perennial clash between our nation&#x2019;s hedonistic impulses and Puritanical roots.

Amplifying things, good or bad, was what Chicago did best.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the days following November 22, 1905, rumors about the shooting spun through the city&#x2019;s streets. The fruit cart vendors whispered to the newsboys who shouted to the hansom drivers who murmured to the society women who were overheard by servants who gossiped with bartenders who bantered with pimps and whores and drunks. Did they hear the wound was just like the one that killed President McKinley? Tore through his abdomen, caught a corner of the liver, grazed the stomach, and skidded to a halt outside the spinal cord&#x2014;lucky for Marshall Junior. He was in his bedroom at the Prairie Avenue mansion, home alone with his son and the hired help, when a hollow boom split the air. A cry followed, thin and drawn out like taffy<br> &nbsp;<br> The family nurse and the butler scaled the stairs in flying jumps and found him slumped in a chair, wan face seeking cover in the curve of his shoulder. Goodness, the blood&#x2014;it was everywhere. Veining across his shirt, fissuring down the wall. His automatic revolver came to rest on the tip of his shoe. He tried to straighten, treaded the air as if it were a lolling wave. &#x201c;I shot myself,&#x201d; Marshall Junior said. &#x201c;Accidentally.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But it couldn&#x2019;t have been an accident. Who really believed that Field dropped his gun, and that the trigger could slam an armchair with sufficient force to explode a cartridge? A reporter at the <i>Chicago Daily News</i> said it was impossible&#x2014;he took an identical, unloaded revolver and hurled it several times to the floor. Not once did the thing go off. Marshall Junior must have pointed the gun at himself; it was the only way. And a suicide attempt made sense. He had suffered a nervous breakdown the year prior, in 1904&#x2014; this act could be a decisive sequel.<br> &nbsp;<br> No, what <i>really</i> happened was sadder than suicide, more pitiful than a nervous breakdown: Field had sneaked off to the Levee district for a tryst at the Everleigh Club. So what if he was married, the father of three&#x2014;he had money and status and power, and men with those things always went to the Everleigh Club. A prostitute shot him, maybe in the Gold Room or the Japanese Parlor or beneath the glass chandeliers suspended like stalactites from the ceiling. Later, as the sun deserted the sky and the streets gripped the fog, those Scarlet Sisters, Minna and Ada Everleigh, ordered his unconscious body smuggled out and planted in his home.<br> &nbsp;<br> Those Scarlet Sisters heard all about their alleged hand in the incident, how they stood idly by while one of their harlots blasted the poor man, then directed the covert removal of his bloody body.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We are a funeral parlor,&#x201d; Ada Everleigh said, &#x201c;instead of a resort.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Her younger sister, Minna, gave a blunt, trumpet-burst laugh. Ada parsed her words as if they were in limited supply, but damned if she didn&#x2019;t load each one before it left her mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Chicago rumor mill operated as predictably as the Everleighs&#x2019; regular clients; no matter how gossip began, or where it twisted and turned, it ended up, invariably, at the doorstep of 2131&#x2013;2133 South Dearborn Street. Nonsense, every bit of it. The sisters had decided long ago to permit no stains, blood or otherwise, on their house.<br> &nbsp;<br> Neither would the Everleighs add their own voices to the din. Discretion paid&#x2014;but also had its price.<br> &nbsp;<br> Even Chicago&#x2019;s newspapers kept their distance from the speculation for fear that Marshall Field Sr. would pull his advertising dollars. He certainly wouldn&#x2019;t appreciate reports that his son, currently lying in critical condition at Mercy Hospital, had visited a whorehouse, even one as dignified as the Everleigh Club. Still, journalists staked out the sisters all week, trying to score something&#x2014;anything&#x2014;that would be safe to print. Minna and Ada waited in the front parlor, expecting yet another newsman.<br> &nbsp;<br> All thirty Everleigh Club harlots remained upstairs in their boudoirs, preparing for the night ahead, running razors under their arms, down and xx prologue: angels of the line between their legs&#x2014;clients didn&#x2019;t have a smooth woman at home. They packed themselves with sponges, made certain they had enough douche, checked cabinets for the little black pills that, along with three days of hot baths, usually &#x201c;brought a girl around&#x201d; from any unwanted condition. They yanked and tied one another&#x2019;s corsets, buttoned up gowns made of slippery silk, unrolled black stockings over long legs. Hair was wound tight with pins or left to fall in tousled waves, depending on the preference of their regulars. A dab of gasoline&#x2014;the newest fad in perfume, if you couldn&#x2019;t afford an automobile&#x2014;behind the ears, across the wrists and ankles, between the breasts. Eyes rimmed in black and lashes painted, standing stiffer than the prongs of a fork. Each courtesan had a name chosen by her peers. Once she entered this life&#x2014;<i>the</i> life&#x2014;she discarded all remnants of the one she&#x2019;d left behind.<br> &nbsp;<br> Minna navigated the silk couches, the easy chairs, and the grand piano, the statues of Greek goddesses peering through exotic palms, the bronze effigies of Cupid and Psyche, the imported rugs that swallowed footsteps. She had an odd walk, a sort of caterpillar bend and hump, pause and catch up, as the poet Edgar Lee Masters, a friend and frequent client, described it. She came to rest before a wide-paneled window and swallowed, her throat squeezing behind a brooch of diamonds thick as a clenched fist. Holding back the curtain, she surveyed Dearborn Street.<br> &nbsp;<br> Arc lamps stretched up and out, unfurling bold ribbons of light. The air was thick and yellow, as if the varnish manufacturer on the next block had slathered his product across the sky. Visibility was reduced to the next street, or the next corner, or sometimes just the next step. No matter: Minna didn&#x2019;t have to see the Levee district to know what it was up to.<br> &nbsp;<br> Panders, an underworld term that served as both verb and noun, were outfitted in dandy ties and jaunty hats, lurking in corners and alleys. Eugene Hustion and his wife, Lottie, the &#x201c;King and Queen of the Cokies,&#x201d; weighed thirty pounds of cocaine and half as much morphine. Soon their salesmen would make the rounds. Funny thing was, Minna knew, Lottie was a college graduate who spoke five languages, and in her spare time composed music and painted portraits.<br> &nbsp;<br> Down the street, at the House of All Nations, johns lined up at the $2 and $5 entrances&#x2014;too bad the suckers didn&#x2019;t know that the same girls worked both sides. Blind men cranked hurdy-gurdies, spinning tangled reams of melody. The air reeked of sweat and blood and swine entrails, prologue: angels of the line xxi drifting up from the Union Stock Yards just a few blocks southwest. Mickey Finn hawked his eponymous &#x201c;Special&#x201d; at his Dearborn Street bar. Merry Widdo Kiddo, the famous peep-show girl, warmed up her booth, breasts twirling like pinwheels behind the glass. Levee piano players&#x2014; &#x201c;professors,&#x201d; they were called&#x2014;cracked their knuckles before plucking out the hiccuped notes of ragtime.<br> &nbsp;<br> Minna watched a figure turn the corner of 21st Street onto Dearborn and waited for the solemn gong of the bell. She patted the dark, frizzed coil of hair at the nape of her neck and reached for the door. From knuckle to wrist to elbow, waist to bodice to neck, she was ablaze in jewels. Diamonds played with the parlor light, tossing tiny rainbows against the wall.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How <i>is</i> my boy?&#x201d; she said, her customary greeting for every caller.<br> &nbsp;<br> The boy this time was Frank Carson of the <i>Chicago Inter Ocean</i>, a once respected newspaper that had declined in recent years. Minna invited him inside with a slow-motion sweep of her arm. He was no stranger to the Everleigh Club; every reporter in the city knew its phone number, Calumet 412, by heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Carson saw precisely what the Everleighs wished him to see, and knew what they wished him to know. Both sisters had a prim, close-lipped smile, genuine but guarded, as if a full-on grin risked conveying complexities best left unmined. The younger one, Minna, was the talker. She spoke in clipped, staccato sentences, shooting words from her mouth&#x2014;it was so good to see her boy, it had been far too long since his last visit, he should stop by more often. She broke occasionally for a frenetic drag of a goldtipped, perfumed cigarette. Ada stood next to her sister, quiet. Her eyes were darker, her hair lighter, her figure fuller. Her hands were wind-chill cold.<br> &nbsp;<br> Frank Carson knew they ran a clean place with clean girls; their house doctor never forged the reports. He knew that Sunday was &#x201c;Beau Night&#x201d; at the Everleigh Club, when girls were permitted to see their sweethearts, to accept flowers and hold hands, to experience all the thrills of dating as if they lived in homes. He knew there had been a shooting at the Club two years earlier, an unfortunate incident that was no fault of the sisters&#x2019;. He knew the Everleighs brought a bit of decency to a profession rife with shame.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>The Finding of the Third Eye</h2><p>A discussion of the secrets of breathing, color, sound, diet, and exercise, and how these can be used to develop the third eye.

But how can a woman get her needs met when she&#39;s relinquished her power to her dominant partner? With warmth, wisdom and a down-to-earth approach, experienced submissive Kacie Cunningham analyzes the realities of the dominant-submissive lifestyle and suggests ways in which both partners can experience the greatest possible growth and pleasure. At the heart of the book is an emotion Kacie has dubbed &#34;Conquer Me&#34; -- which she defines as &#34;the submissive&#39;s internal demand for a show of strength.&#34; Without a clear understanding of &#34;conquer me,&#34; both submissive and dominant may find themselves at odds -- either fighting unhappily, or watching the passion ebb from their relationship. This book explains this unique need and how to get it met -- essential knowledge for any submissive or couple who wants to get the most out of their D/s lifestyle.</p><p>Kacie Cunningham had her first real experience with kink when she was 18 years old, and has spent the last decade searching out better and safer ways of doing it. Some of her favorite non-kinky things to do are read, sew, knit, and bake, and she spends much of her time writing, loving, and laughing. At the time of publication, she has been with her Master for four years, and they live in Indianapolis, with their two dogs and two fish. They hope to one day find the perfect submissive girl to add to their family, but they aren&#39;t looking. This is her first book.The paradox is that the needs of the Master are not, in fact, superior to the needs of the submissive. Rather, they share equal importance. In fact, sometimes, the need of the submissive to serve actually overrides the Master&#39;s need for independence. In my case, I know there are things that Master asks or allows me to do even though he might prefer to do it himself, simply because it affords me an opportunity to serve him, and I need that. To put it simply, we are well suited, in that our needs so neatly complement one another that we meet one another&#39;s needs simply by ensuring that our own are met. He needs to know what is happening inside of me so that he can most effectively dominate me ... and I need to open myself up and be vulnerable to him so that I can experience the depths of my submission. However, it would be unrealistic to imagine that this is always the case! There are times when both parties in any relationship will subjugate their own needs in favor of their partner&#39;s needs. The point is that both (or all, if you&#39;re poly) members of the relationship are human, with feelings and needs, and that the onus for &#39;giving in&#39; should not be put upon the submissive only, if the relationship is going to be successful. I am fond of saying that in any relationship, if one person&#39;s needs aren&#39;t being met, that person is likely to leave in order to get those needs met elsewhere. And underneath, kink aside, we&#39;re all just people.</p><h2>The Habsburg Empire: A New History</h2><p><p>A <i>EuropeNow</i> Editor&#x2019;s Pick<br>A <i>Choice</i> Outstanding Academic Title of the Year</p><p>&#x201c;Pieter M.

She lives in Texas with her husband, three children, and an assortment of pets.Chapter 1<br><br>Mairin Stuart knelt on the stone floor beside her pallet and bowed her head in her evening prayer. Her hand slipped to the small wooden cross hanging from a bit of leather around her neck, and her thumb rubbed a familiar path over the now smooth surface.<br><br>For several long minutes, she whispered the words she&#x2019;d recited since she was a child, and then she ended it as she always did. Please, God. Don&#x2019;t let them find me.<br><br>She pushed herself from the floor, her knees scraping the uneven stones. The plain, brown garb she wore signaled her place along the other novices. Though she&#x2019;d been here far longer than the others, she&#x2019;d never taken the vows that would complete her spiritual journey. It was never her intention.<br><br>She went to the basin in the corner and poured from the pitcher of water. She smiled as she dampened her cloth, and Mother Serenity&#x2019;s words came floating to mind. Cleanliness is next to Godliness.<br><br>She wiped her face and started to remove her gown to extend her wash when she heard a terrible crash. Startled, she dropped the cloth and whirled around to stare at her closed door. Then galvanized to action, she ran and flung it open, racing into the hall.<br><br>Around her, the other nuns also filled the hall, their dismayed murmurs rising. A loud bellow echoed down the corridor from the abbey&#x2019;s front entrance. A cry of pain followed the bellow, and Mairin&#x2019;s heart froze. Mother Serenity.<br><br>Mairin and the rest of the sisters ran toward the sound, some lagging back while others shoved determinedly ahead. When they reached the chapel, Mairin drew up short, paralyzed by the sight before her.<br><br>Warriors were everywhere. There were at least twenty, all dressed in battle gear, their faces unwashed, sweat drenching their hair and clothing. But no blood. They hadn&#x2019;t come for sanctuary or aid. The leader held Mother Serenity by the arm, and even from a distance, Mairin could see the abbess&#x2019;s face drawn in pain.<br><br>&#x201c;Where is she?&#x201d; the man demanded in a cold voice.<br><br>Mairin took a step back. He was a fierce-�looking man. Evil. Rage coiled in his eyes like a snake waiting to strike. He shook Mother Serenity when she didn&#x2019;t respond, and she warbled in his grasp like a rag doll.<br><br>Mairin crossed herself and whispered an urgent prayer. The nuns around her gathered in a close ball and also offered their prayers.<br><br>&#x201c;She is not here,&#x201d; Mother Serenity gasped out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve told you the woman you seek is not here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You lie!&#x201d; he roared.<br><br>He looked toward the group of nuns, his gaze flickering coldly over them.<br><br>&#x201c;Mairin Stuart. Tell me where she is.&#x201d;<br><br>Mairin went cold, fear rising to a boil in her stomach. How had he found her? After all this time. Her nightmare wasn&#x2019;t over. It was, indeed, just beginning.<br><br>Her hands shook so badly that she had to hide them in the folds of her dress. Sweat gathered on her brow, and her gut lurched. She swallowed, willing herself not to be sick.<br><br>When no answer was forthcoming, the man smiled, and it sent a chill straight down Mairin&#x2019;s spine. Still staring at them, he lifted Mother Serenity&#x2019;s arm so that it was in plain sight. Callously, he bent her index finger until Mairin heard the betraying pop of bone.<br><br>One of the nuns shrieked and ran forward only to be backhanded down by one of the soldiers. The rest of the nuns gasped at the bold outrage.<br><br>&#x201c;This is God&#x2019;s house,&#x201d; Mother Serenity said in a reedy voice. &#x201c;You sin greatly by bringing violence onto holy ground.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up, old woman,&#x201d; the man snapped. &#x201c;Tell me where Mairin Stuart is or I&#x2019;ll kill every last one of you.&#x201d;<br><br>Mairin sucked in her breath and curled her fingers into balls at her sides. She believed him. There was too much evil, too much desperation, in his eyes. He had been sent on a devil&#x2019;s errand, and he wouldn&#x2019;t be denied.<br><br>He grasped Mother Serenity&#x2019;s middle finger, and Mairin rushed forward.<br><br>&#x201c;Charity, nay!&#x201d; Mother Serenity cried.<br><br>Mairin ignored her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Mairin Stuart. Now let her go!&#x201d;<br><br>The man dropped Mother Serenity&#x2019;s hand then shoved the woman back. He stared at Mairin with interest, then let his gaze wander suggestively down her body and back up again. Mairin&#x2019;s cheeks flamed at the blatant disrespect, but she gave no quarter, staring back at the man with as much defiance as she dared.<br><br>He snapped his fingers, and two men advanced on Mairin, grabbing her before she could think to run. They had her on the floor in a split second, their hands fumbling with the hem of her gown.<br><br>She kicked wildly, flailing her arms, but she was no match for their strength. Would they rape her here on the chapel floor? Tears gathered in her eyes as they shoved her clothing up over her hips.<br><br>They turned her to the right and fingers touched her hip, right where the mark rested.<br><br>Oh nay.<br><br>She bowed her head as tears of defeat slipped down her cheeks.<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2019;Tis her!&#x201d; one of them said excitedly.<br><br>He was instantly shoved aside as the leader bent over to examine the mark for himself.<br><br>He, too, touched it, outlining the royal crest of Alexander. Issuing a grunt of satisfaction, he curled his hand around her chin and yanked until she faced him.<br><br>His smile revolted her.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been looking for you a long time, Mairin Stuart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go to hell,&#x201d; she spat.<br><br>Instead of striking her, his grin broadened. &#x201c;Tsk-�tsk, such blasphemy in the house of God.&#x201d;<br><br>He stood rapidly, and before Mairin could blink, she was hauled over a man&#x2019;s shoulder, and the soldiers filed out of the abbey and into the cool night.<br><br>They wasted no time getting onto their horses. Mairin was gagged then trussed hand and foot and tossed over the saddle in front of one of the men. They were away, the thunder of hooves echoing across the still night, before she had time to react. They were as precise as they were ruthless.<br><br>The saddle dug into her belly, and she bounced up and down until she was sure she was going to throw up. She moaned, afraid she&#x2019;d choke with the gag so securely around her mouth.<br><br>When they finally stopped, she was nearly unconscious. A hand gripped her nape, the fingers easily circling the slim column. She was hauled upward and dropped unceremoniously to the ground.<br><br>Around her, they made camp while she lay shivering in the damp air. Finally she heard one say, &#x201c;You best be seeing to the lass, Finn. Laird Cameron won&#x2019;t be happy if she dies of exposure.&#x201d;<br><br>An irritated grunt followed, but a minute later, she was untied and the gag removed. Finn, the apparent leader of this abduction, leaned down over her, his eyes gleaming in the light of the fire.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no one to hear you scream, and if you utter a sound, I&#x2019;ll rattle your jaw.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded her understanding and crawled to an upright position. He nudged her backside with his boot and chuckled when she whirled around in outrage.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a blanket by the fire. Get on it and get some sleep. We leave at first light.&#x201d;<br><br>She curled gratefully into the warmth of the blanket, uncaring that the stones and sticks on the ground dug into her skin. Laird Cameron. She&#x2019;d heard talk of him from the soldiers who drifted in and out of the abbey. He was a ruthless man. Greedy and eager to add to his growing power. It was rumored that his army was one of the largest in all of Scotland and that David, the Scottish king, feared him.<br><br>Malcolm, bastard son of Alexander&#x2014;�and her half brother&#x2014;�had already led one revolt against David in a bid for the throne. Were Malcolm and Duncan Cameron to ally, they would be a near unstoppable force.<br><br>She swallowed and closed her eyes. The possession of Neamh �lainn would render Cameron invincible.<br><br>&#x201c;Dear God, help me,&#x201d; she whispered.<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t allow him to gain control of Neamh �lainn. It was her legacy, the only thing of her father&#x2019;s that she had.<br><br>It was impossible to sleep, and so she lay there huddled in the blanket, her hand curled around the wooden cross as she prayed for strength and guidance. Some of the soldiers slept while others kept careful watch. She wasn&#x2019;t fool enough to think she&#x2019;d be given any opportunity to escape. Not when she was worth more than her weight in gold.<br><br>But they wouldn&#x2019;t kill her either, which granted her an advantage. She had nothing to fear by trying to escape and everything to gain.<br><br>An hour into her vigil of prayer, a commotion behind her had her sitting straight up and staring into the darkness. Around her, the sleeping soldiers stumbled upward, their hands on their swords when a child&#x2019;s cry rent the night.<br><br>One of the men hauled a kicking, wiggling child into the circle around the fire and dropped him on the ground. The child crouched and looked around wildly while the men laughed uproariously.<br><br>&#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; Finn demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;Caught him trying to sneak one of the horses,&#x201d; the child&#x2019;s captor said.<br><br>Anger slanted Finn&#x2019;s features into those of the devil, made more demonic by the light of the fire. The boy, who couldn&#x2019;t be more than seven or eight years old, tilted his chin up defiantly as if daring the man to do his worst.<br><br>&#x201c;Why you insolent little pup,&#x201d; Finn roared.<br><br>He raised his hand, and Mairin flew across the ground, throwing herself in front of the child as the fist swung and clipped her cheek.<br><br>She went reeling but recovered and quickly threw herself back over the child, gathering him close so she could cover as much of him as possible.<br><br>The boy struggled wildly under her, screeching obscenities in Gaelic. His head connected with her already aching jaw, and she saw stars.<br><br>&#x201c;Hush now,&#x201d; she told him in his own language. &#x201c;Be still. I won&#x2019;t let them hurt you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get off him!&#x201d; Finn roared.<br><br>She tightened around the little boy who finally stopped kicking and flailing. Finn reached down and curled his hand into her hair, yanking brutally upward, but she refused to let go of her charge.</p><h2>The Last Odyssey: A Thriller (Sigma Force Novels, 15)</h2><p><p><strong>To save the world and our future, Sigma Force must embark on a dangerous odyssey into an ancient past whose horrors are all too present in this page-turning thriller from #1&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling author James Rollins that combines cutting-edge science, historical mystery, mythology, and pulse-pounding action.</strong></p><p>For eons, the city of Troy&#x2014;whose legendary fall was detailed in Homer&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>Iliad</em>&#x2014;was believed to be myth, until archaeologists in the nineteenth century uncovered its ancient walls buried beneath the sands. If Troy was real, how much of Homer&#x2019;s twin tales of gods and monsters, curses and miracles&#x2014;<em>The Iliad</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Odyssey</em>&#x2014;could also be true and awaiting discovery?</p><p>In the frozen tundra of Greenland, a group of modern-day&nbsp;researchers&nbsp;stumble on a shocking find: a medieval ship buried a half-mile below the ice. The ship&#x2019;s hold contains a collection of even older artifacts&#x2014;tools of war&#x2014;dating back to the Bronze Age. Inside the captain&#x2019;s cabin is a magnificent treasure that is as priceless as it is miraculous: a clockwork gold&nbsp;map&nbsp;imbedded with&nbsp;an intricate silver astrolabe.

But the route detours as the map opens to reveal a fiery river leading to a hidden realm underneath the Mediterranean Sea. It is the subterranean world of Tartarus, the Greek name for Hell. In mythology, Tartarus was where the wicked were punished and the monstrous Titans of old, imprisoned.</p><p>When word of Tartarus spreads&#x2014;and of the cache of miraculous weapons said to be hidden there&#x2014;tensions explode in this volatile region where Turks battle Kurds, terrorists wage war, and civilians suffer untold horrors. The phantasmagoric horrors found in Homer&#x2019;s tales are all too real&#x2014;and could be unleashed upon the world. Whoever possesses them can use their awesome power to control the future of humanity.</p><p>Now, Sigma Force must go where humans fear to tread. To prevent a tyrant from igniting a global war, they must cross the very gates of Hell.</p></p><p>JAMES ROLLINS is a #1 New York Times bestselling author of international thrillers that have been translated into more than forty languages.

Or so they thought. Now, many years later, the Guardians have settled into their final selves, embracing their public images and the Earth Holidays. But the world has not been without evil since Pitch&#x2019;s imprisonment. First there was the World War, then The Crash which has led to what the humans call a Great Depression. All the Guardians feel the weight of these events, but Jack Frost&#x2014;now half human, half of his former self Nightlight&#x2014;feels it the most.<br> <br>Jack&#x2019;s transition from Nightlight to Guardian was not an easy one. Always inclined to keep to himself, Jack has become especially isolated from the other Guardians since his transformation. Yet it is Jack who Ombric Shalazar (once a great wizard, now known as Father Time) trusts with a tremendous secret. But for Jack to fully understand this secret, he must revisit his past&#x2014;and finally tell his story.<br> <br>Jack&#x2019;s story, however, isn&#x2019;t the only one to be reopened; an old enemy whose chapter we thought closed will reappear and with him bring a darkness and destruction that will test the Guardians like never before.

Exactly one week after watching the tape, four teenagers die one after another of heart failure.<br><br>Asakawa, a hardworking journalist, is intrigued by his niece's inexplicable death. His investigation leads him from a metropolitan tokyo teeming with modern society's fears to a rural Japan--a mountain resort, a volcanic island, and a countryside clinic--haunted by the past. His attempt to solve the tape's mystery before it's too late--for everyone--assumes an increasingly deadly urgency. Ring is a chillingly told horror story, a masterfully suspenseful mystery, and post-modern trip. <br><br>The success of Koji Suzuki's novel the <i>Ring</i> has lead to manga, television and film adaptations in Japan, Korea, and the U.S.</p><p>Koji Suzuki is based in Tokyo but spends most of his time traveling.

As in a classic ghost story, fate singles out one, often innocent character as a scapegoat. But the misogynistic society that persecutes Sadako and her mother must ultimately bear witness to its sin-or perish. Anyone curious in how the Japanese see themselves will find this book a fascinating, and ultimately highly disturbing, experience." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>" With the release of <i>The Ring</i> (and its Japanese inspiration) on video (and talk of a sequel to the American film), this novel is sure to be much in demand among both mystery and horror fans."- David Pitt<i>,&nbsp; Booklist<br></i>&nbsp;<br>"From its eerie opening to its chilling conclusion, this novel by the "Stephen King of Asia" will keep readers glued to its pages." -<i> Library Journal</i><br><br>"But Suzuki is plowing a path that nobody else has traveled, as his 'Ring'-virus is born into an all-too vulnerable world. There are so many extremely clever riffs that never made it into either movie that readers aren't likely to notice how wide the road recently traveled is until they catch their breath and manage to look back." -<i> Agony Columns </i><br><br>"Suzuki's ambitious trilogy does succeed, and it's hard not to be impressed with his aplomb in turning a straight supernatural horror mystery around into a piece of pure science fiction." - <i>TIMES</i></p><h2>Rabble in Arms</h2><p>The second of Roberts&#39;s epic novels of the American Revolution, Rabble in Arms was hailed by one critic as the greatest historical novel written about America upon its publication in 1933.

The stories and movies featured in<i> Adaptations</i> include: <br><br>�Philip K.

They can dazzle us with special effects, wow us with an eight-minute tracking shot, or intrigue us with a cartoonlike color palette. But we still expect a story. A story visually told, perhaps&#x2014;but a story nonetheless.<br><br>And that&#x2019;s why &#x201c;film feeds off literature like sharks off a marlin,&#x201d; as film theorist George Bluestone once said. Director Stanley Kubrick was a compulsive reader, sometimes tearing through a book a day in his constant search for new material. Alfred Hitchcock told of imagining the shape of a film, then having to search for a story to fit his visualization. Howard Hawks claimed that the hardest part of making a movie was finding a good story, then figuring out how to tell it. Steven Spielberg agrees. Even Michelangelo Antonioni was a reader, although he claimed the best way to approach a book was to read it, then forget it. Directors, especially those of the auteur ilk, get a lot of credit for their successes and a lot of blame for their failures. But, like prominent CEOs, they depend a great deal on others. Unless directors write their own material, they will have to go to the source: writers. And there are as many approaches to this as there are directorial personalities.<br><br><i>The Translator: Altman and Short Cuts</i><br><br>In 1990, while flying home from Italy, Robert Altman read a book of short stories by Raymond Carver. &#x201c;I was so moved by the way he told stories,&#x201d; he later said, &#x201c;what he told and what he didn&#x2019;t tell and how he made a story out of the slightest little incident. I was just amazed by it and I thought this is what we should do in film.&#x201d;<br><br>For just over a decade, from the early 1970s through the mid-&#x2019;80s, Carver led the return to realistic fiction that revels in the quotidian. His stories feature hard-drinking, unhappily married, working-class folk who live, as Tess Gallagher, Carver&#x2019;s second wife, puts it, &#x201c;with no safety net and no imagination of a safety net.&#x201d; The residents of &#x201c;Carver Country&#x201d; drift through life&#x2014;often in an alcoholic haze&#x2014;and end in a place very close to where they started. The epiphanies, if you can call them that, are small and internal. As his friend Tobias Wolff has said, Carver &#x201c;is not a particularly quotable writer. That&#x2019;s one of his virtues, that he never tried to achieve a beautiful line. It&#x2019;s the steadiness and quietness of the prose that creates his sense of reality.&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s reality Carver was after: &#x201c;As far as I&#x2019;m concerned,&#x201d; he told an interviewer, &#x201c;the best art has its reference points in real life.&#x201d;<br><br>There is an autobiographical element to his work. Like many of his characters, Carver grew up working class and was, for most of his adult life, a dedicated alcoholic. Throughout his first marriage he was plagued by financial concerns that kept him from his writing. Of his work, he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just bearing witness to something I know something about. Most things in the world I don&#x2019;t know anything at all about. . . . I&#x2019;m bearing witness to what I can.&#x201d; Because of his concern with small moments in the lives of ordinary people, Carver is often compared to Chekhov, and his declarative prose style invites comparison to Hemingway. Yet his sensibility is unquestionably reflective of his own generation. His pared-down realism, tinged with a dash of hopelessness, suited the period following Watergate, and by the time of his death from lung cancer in 1988, Carver was arguably the most influential literary writer in the country.<br><br>Enter Altman. If ever a director was poised to exploit the contemporary short story&#x2014;now so firmly associated with Carver&#x2014;Altman was that director. By the time he discovered Carver&#x2019;s stories, Altman had already directed twenty-five feature films (including <i>M*A*S*H</i>, <i>McCabe and Mrs. Miller</i>, <i>The Long Goodbye</i>, and <i>Thieves Like Us</i>), not to mention countless television episodes. He&#x2019;d honed a signature directorial style consisting of overlapping dialogue, improbably large casts, mock-documentary realism, improvisation, and the use of nonprofessional actors. Most important, though, he&#x2019;d already made <i>Nashville</i>, a rambling narrative that loosely weaves the story lines of twenty-four characters, without, as Pauline Kael put it, the &#x201c;clanking of plot.&#x201d; Arguably one of the best films ever made&#x2014;it appears on countless top-100 lists&#x2014;<i>Nashville&#x2019;s</i> lack of narrative thrust baffled many. When asked about his reputation as a &#x201c;problem director,&#x201d; Altman stated, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not difficult. My work may be difficult, but if in fact it is difficult, it just further enforces what I have to say: that all I make films about is what I see and the way things appear to me.&#x201d;<br><br>So why wouldn&#x2019;t Altman admire Carver&#x2019;s stories? There&#x2019;s an obvious link between a writer who is &#x201c;just bearing witness&#x201d; and a filmmaker who is making films about &#x201c;the way things appear to me.&#x201d; Between a writer who eschews quotable lines and a director who uses untrained actors. Between a writer who strives for realistic-sounding dialogue through the use of stammers, pauses, and repeated lines and a director who strives for the same through the use of overlapping sound. Between a writer who resists neatly tied-up endings and a director who has said, &#x201c;Many people, I guess, want to know exactly what it is they&#x2019;re supposed to think. . . . Well, my message is that I am not going to do their work for them.&#x201d; Beyond all this, though, there are deeper affinities. They both look upon their characters with an unflinching but surprisingly nonjudgmental eye. They are both interested in the hyperreality of small moments. And they both balance intuitiveness with painstaking craftsmanship. And yet, it&#x2019;s one thing for Altman to have admired Carver&#x2019;s stories; it&#x2019;s quite another that he knew how to translate them well for film. Only someone with Altman&#x2019;s r�sum� could have seen the possibilities in a random selection of nine unconnected, unplotted stories. And, of course, one poem.<br><br>In the case of <i>Short Cuts</i>, the role of translator is one Altman wears gracefully, but not naturally. His relationship with writers has often been rocky, the writers forced to watch as their words are reduced to rubble. Brian McKay, who wrote the screenplays for several of Altman&#x2019;s films, including <i>McCabe and Mrs. Miller</i>, says, &#x201c;If you want me to get in line with the rest of the angry writers, I will. But it&#x2019;s more complicated than that. I think what Bob really wants is the European credit: &#x2018;A Film by Robert Altman.&#x2019; And, often, he deserves it.&#x201d; Yet when he is impressed with a work, Altman has been known to gush. He loved Edward Anderson&#x2019;s novel <i>Thieves Like Us</i>, and wanted to make as few changes as possible. And then there&#x2019;s Carver. Still, Altman lets it be known that Short Cuts is his.* &#x201c;I read all of Ray&#x2019;s writings, filtering him through my own process. The film is made of little pieces of his work that form sections of scenes and characters out of the most basic elements of Ray&#x2019;s creations&#x2014;new and not new.&#x201d;<br><br>And that, according to Tess Gallagher, would have been okay with Carver. &#x201c;Risking trespass, I will say I believe Ray&#x2019;s attitude toward Altman&#x2019;s use of his work would have been one of permission to an artist of equal stature. . . . He was a straight-on admirer of Altman&#x2019;s films.&#x201d; Gallagher admires <i>Short Cuts</i>&#x2014;and believes Carver would have, too&#x2014;for both its fidelity and its infidelity. &#x201c;The failure of so many scripts of Carver stories by others I&#x2019;d seen prior . . . had been to stay so close to the original that a robotic pandering to the text resulted. They were like someone ice skating with an osprey&#x2019;s egg on which the bird is still nesting.&#x201d;<br><br>The problems of fidelity can be illustrated by &#x201c;Jerry and Molly and Sam,&#x201d; one of the nine stories chosen by Altman for the film. The title refers to three very minor characters&#x2014;one of them a briefly mentioned childhood dog&#x2014;who are not central to the story. Or are they? It&#x2019;s this importance placed on absence that gives Carver&#x2019;s stories much of their power and that attracted Altman in the first place. But it&#x2019;s an untranslatable element, as is Carver&#x2019;s heavy use of introspection. The challenge for Altman was to find cinematic equivalents, which, he admitted, &#x201c;manifest themselves in unexpected ways.&#x201d; Yet for all the things that Altman was forced to change, or chose to change, he kept a great deal too: a pervasive dark humor, an emphasis on fate or luck, a bubbling violence under the surface. The movie was hailed by critics, with Michael Wilmington of the <i>Chicago Tribune </i>raving, &#x201c;Some movies can lay claim to being the best thing around in a week, a month, a year. Robert Altman&#x2019;s <i>Short Cuts</i> is closer to being one of the all-time bests, among the finest American films since the advent of sound.&#x201d;<br><br>It also serves as one of the best examples of an artist grappling to translate the work of another artist&#x2014;and ending up with something that looks very much like a handshake.<br><br><i>The Magician: Antonioni and Blow-Up</i><br><br>If you read Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni&#x2019;s interviews (he gave quite a few), or his essays (he wrote thirty or so), it&#x2019;s hard to avoid noticing that he rarely mentions Julio Cort�zar, the author of the story upon which his masterpiece, <i>Blow-Up</i>, is based. Only when directly asked about the South American author does he acknowledge the movie&#x2019;s origins, as in a 1979 interview: &#x201c;I read Cort�zar&#x2019;s story, I liked it, and I wrote a subject, adapting it to myself.&#x201d;<br><br>Well. If this sounds like faint praise, remember it comes from the same man who said, &#x201c;As the director, I am God. I can allow myself any kind of liberty.&#x201d; Antonioni put the &#x201c;A&#x201d; in auteur; on his sets, he was the indisputable alpha personality. By the time he directed <i>Blow-U</i>p in 1966 he had almost a dozen films under his belt and had distinguished himself as a director primarily concerned with images. To Antonioni, words and images are in opposition&#x2014;and words are propaganda or, worse yet, lies. &#x201c;Someone once said that words, more than anything else, serve to hide our thoughts,&#x201d; he told an audience of Italian film students. He distrusted screenplays, saying, &#x201c;This is the limit of the script: to give words to events that reject words.&#x201d; And he used dialogue only when an image would not suffice. Visual storytelling was more than his tendency; it was a philosophical decision: &#x201c;Of this I am firmly convinced&#x2014;&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that cinema today should be tied to the truth rather than to logic. And the truth of our daily lives is neither mechanical, conventional, nor artificial, as stories generally are, and if films are made that way, they will show it.&#x201d;<br><br>It is perhaps this distrust of words, this sense that stories are artificial, that fueled his disdain for literary sources. For Antonioni, a story or a novel was just one of any number of items that he&#x2014;the magician&#x2014;tossed into his hat before pulling out a rabbit: &#x201c;I prefer [to say]: In that period, certain events happened in the world, I saw certain people, I was reading certain books, I was looking at certain paintings, I loved X, I hated Y, I didn&#x2019;t have any money, I wasn&#x2019;t sleeping much.&#x201d; (Yet, despite all of this protestation, Antonioni began writing at a young age and continued to write throughout his life. He adapted portions of his story collection, <i>That Bowling Alley on the Tiber</i> [1987], into <i>Beyond the Clouds</i>, starring John Malkovich as the &#x201c;director.&#x201d;) Reinventing cinema was his aim, and new techniques were all in service of finding answers to fundamental questions: &#x201c;What is it that torments and motivates modern man? Of all that has happened and is now happening in the world, what are the repercussions inside a man, what are the consequences in his most intimate relationships and dealings with others? Today, more than ever, these are the questions we should keep in mind when we prepare ourselves to make a film.&#x201d;<br><br>So it&#x2019;s no wonder Antonioni was attracted to Cort�zar&#x2019;s story: Cort�zar was trying to do in words what Antonioni was trying to do with images. Cort�zar was seeking a way to explode the narrative mechanism, to find a way to tell a story that was in tune with his times (&#x201c;Blow-Up&#x201d; was first published in 1958) and the troubled politics of Latin America. &#x201c;The truth is, each day . . . I write worse and worse, from an aesthetic point of view,&#x201d; he said in an interview. &#x201c;It may be absurd for a writer to insist on discarding his work instruments. But I think those instruments are false. I want to wipe my slate clean, start from scratch.&#x201d; &#x201c;Blow-Up,&#x201d; with its shifting points of view and absolutely unreliable narrator, does just that. It&#x2019;s a conceptual story, an idea with words wrapped around it, a halting, backstepping, existential Jabberwocky. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll never be known how this has to be told,&#x201d; the first paragraph begins, &#x201c;in the first person or in the second, using the third person plural or continually inventing modes that will serve for nothing. If one might say: I will see the moon rose, or: we hurt me at the back of my eyes, and especially: you the blond woman was the clouds that race before my your his our yours their faces. What the hell.&#x201d;<br><br>Both Cort�zar and Antonioni are interested in art as exploration, as provocation. Each in his chosen form has worked to strip the expository from story, forcing the reader/viewer to fill in missing pieces. Both concern themselves with the interplay of form and content. But Cort�zar is more playful than Antonioni, less aware (maybe self-consciously so) of his stature as an artist. &#x201c;The truth is that I don&#x2019;t care a straw for Literature with a capital L; the only thing that interests me is searching for (and sometimes finding) myself in a contest with words that eventually produces something called a book.&#x201d; Throughout his career, play (and gamesmanship) was at the center of his work. Hopscotch, probably his most famous novel, is constructed for two possible readings. First, in the normal sequential fashion, and second, using a hopscotch sequence (chapters 73, 1, 2, 116, 3, 84 . . .). Now considered the first hypertext novel, it anticipates the possibilities of the World Wide Web&#x2019;s nonsequential structure. But for Cort�zar, it was about the game. &#x201c;It would be absolutely impossible for me to live if I couldn&#x2019;t play,&#x201d; he claimed.</p><h2>Devotional Cinema: Revised 3rd Edition</h2><p>Literary Nonfiction.

I didn&#x2019;t ask him what was in it. The box belonged to my grandmother, so I didn&#x2019;t care. Long before the Alzheimer&#x2019;s got her mind, a fear of living had taken hold of her spirit, convincing me that my grandmother had no stories worth listening to.</p><p>I squatted by the edge of the shallow hole in the middle of my grandmother&#x2019;s peonies, smelling sweat and summer grass as I dug my fingers into the dark earth and held up my handfuls of dirt briefly before opening my clenched hands, the clods raining shadows onto the box below. The dirt struck the tin with soft patters like little fists against the sealed box, demanding the release of its secrets. I yawned and turned away, the box and whatever it might contain forgotten by the time the screen door of the back porch slammed shut behind me.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t thought about that hot afternoon for over a decade: a non-event in a busy life filled with friends, parties and my never-ending quest for accolades and excitement in the saddle on the back of a high-jumping horse. I had thought myself indestructible, immune to the fears and disappointments that had stolen the color from my grandmother&#x2019;s face the same way the setting sun creates a world of shadows.</p><p>My delusion was understandable to my grandfather, who knew the source of it. After all, he was the one who&#x2019;d told me that being the sole survivor of an accident that took the lives of both my parents meant that God was saving me for something important. I took this to mean that I had already experienced the greatest tragedy of my life and nothing bad would ever happen to me again. My grandmother claimed I was merely tempting the devil. But I was content to exist in my make-believe world, where I was infallible until the day came when I was forced to realize how very wrong I&#x2019;d been. Life is like that, I suppose: always slapping you in the face when you least expect it.</p><p>The doorbell rang, erasing the smells of summer grass and damp earth. I rose slowly from my chair in the front parlor, scanning my eyes over the worn furniture with the eyes of a person who hadn&#x2019;t become accustomed to its growing shabbiness for over twenty years. The house still smelled of flowers although the last of the wilted funeral arrangements had been put out at the curb the previous evening with the rest of the garbage. I had hoped that keeping the flowers in the house would help me feel the grief I knew was living somewhere under my skin. I had done enough grieving in my life by the age of six that I guess my body figured I just couldn&#x2019;t do it anymore.</p><p>The doorbell rang again and I walked stiffly to the door, my back and right knee protesting every step. Humidity hung over Savannah in the summer like a veil, antagonizing my injuries as much as any cold weather would. I&#x2019;d long since reached the conclusion that there was no climate that would coddle my bruised bones, so I might as well stay in this ancient city and old house that had been in my mother&#x2019;s family for four generations.</p><p>I swallowed back my disappointment as I pulled open the door and revealed my granddaddy&#x2019;s lawyer, a man about ten years younger than the grandfather I had just buried. His skin was tinged gray like the color of dried marsh mud and he had down-turned eyes that always seemed to look anxious.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Morton,&#x201d; I said, stepping aside to allow him through the doorway. &#x201c;This is a nice surprise.&#x201d; I had hoped it would be one of my old friends from my equestrian days, the friends whose visits had trickled down to a slow drip in the last years. They&#x2019;d gotten tired of asking me when I was going to ride again, and stopped visiting, as if whatever I&#x2019;d contracted that kept me on the ground might be contagious. I had no classmates, having been homeschooled for most of my life, and my friendships had centered around the show circuit. A few had made an appearance at the wake, but that was all. Even Jen Bishop, my oldest friend and closest rival, had merely sent a flower arrangement and a note.</p><p>Mr. Morton grunted and led the way to the parlor. I indicated for him to sit only a moment after he&#x2019;d taken his place in my favorite chair, the same chair my grandmother had sat in each evening with her endless knitting.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I get you something to drink?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you get me something to drink, dear?&#x201d;</p><p>I paused, wondering if it would be polite to suggest he put in his hearing aid.</p><p>&#x201c;What would you like, Mr. Morton? Tea or lemonade?&#x201d; I watched as he ran his finger across the dust on the side table, etching out a single line of accusation about my lack of housekeeping skills. &#x201c;Or maybe arsenic?&#x201d; I added softly.</p><p>He blinked slowly up at me, and for a horrible second I wondered if he&#x2019;d actually heard me. &#x201c;A Co-Cola would be nice. It&#x2019;s a hot day.&#x201d;</p><p>I left the room and returned with two glasses of Coke filled two-thirds with ice. I&#x2019;d only had a partial can and rather than try to go through the motions of explaining this to Mr. Morton, I figured it would be easier to just go with what I had.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Piper,&#x201d; he said as he took a long sip, then wrinkled his nose before setting it on a coaster.</p><p>&#x201c;What can I do for you, Mr. Morton?&#x201d; I asked loudly, sitting on the worn sofa next to his chair.</p><p>He placed his briefcase on the coffee table in front of him and made a big show of opening it and taking out a large manila folder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got some papers for you to sign concerning your grandfather&#x2019;s estate.&#x201d; He slid the stack in front of me and handed me a thick black ...</p></p><h2>The Walking Dead Book 8 (Walking Dead, 8)</h2><p><ul> <li>Rick and his group rebuild from the events of NO WAY OUT, and learn that maybe they can take part in A LARGER WORLD.</li> <li>Collects <i>The Walking Dead</i> # 85-96.</li></ul></p><p></p><h2>The Great Themes of Scripture: New Testament</h2><p>&#x201c;A refreshing summary of the New Testament....Useful for adult education and small study groups.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Catholic Transcript</i> <br><br>ALSO AVAILABLE&#x2014;Great Themes of Scripture: Old Testament</p><p>A refreshing summary of the New Testament...Useful for adult education and small study groups.Fr.

She went on to become one of the world's most famous scientists.&nbsp;Curie&#x2019;s revolutionary discoveries over several decades created the field of atomic physics, and Curie herself coined the word <i>radioactivity</i>. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person ever to win in two different fields&#x2014;chemistry and physics.<br><br><i>Marie Curie for Kids</i> introduces this legendary figure in all her complexity. Kids learn how Curie worked alongside her husband and scientific partner, Pierre, while also teaching and raising two daughters; how this intense scientist sometimes became so involved with her research that she forgot to eat or sleep; and how she struggled with health issues, refused to patent her discoveries (which would have made her very wealthy), and made valuable contributions during World War I.<br><br> Packed with historic photos, informative sidebars, a resource section, and 21 hands-on activities and experiments that illuminate Curie&#x2019;s life and work, <i>Marie Curie for Kids</i> is an indispensable resource for budding scientific explorers. Kids can: examine real World War I X-rays; make a model of the element carbon; make traditional Polish pierogies; and much more.&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>Amy M. O&#x2019;Quinn</b> is a former teacher and a freelance writer who has contributed to many educational publications, including&nbsp;<i>Jack and Jill</i>,&nbsp;<i>Learning Through History</i>, <i>Guideposts for Kids</i>,&nbsp;<i>Highlights for Children</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Old Schoolhouse Magazine</i>,&nbsp;<i>Homeschooling Today</i>, and others. She lives in southern Georgia.Gr 4 Up&#x2014;Biographical science books for students are often limited to cursory overviews that don't provide much background; this is not the case with O'Quinn's exploration of Marie Curie (1867&#x2013;1934). Not only does O'Quinn extensively detail the life of Curie, she places her accomplishments within the context of the time period. Curie's Polish background is also emphasized prominently in the narrative. The text is clear and straightforward and includes a time line of Curie's life and profiles of other scientists. The title also lists 21 activities and experiments that let students not only read about Curie's life but also experience it firsthand. This level of interactivity makes this offering a solid choice for those who are interested in science and for upper elementary and middle school teachers developing lessons. The activities and experiments could complement a science curriculum focused on teaching the basic principles of experimentation and scientific investigation. The activities will also help students develop research skills.

Among them were: young Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler, Theodor Herzl, Gustav Klimt, and the playwright Arthur Schnitzler, whose <b>La Ronde</b> was the great erotic drama of the fin de siecle. Morton studies these and other gifted young men, interweaving their fates with that of the doomed Prince and the entire city through to the eve of Easter, just after Rudolf's body is lowered into its permanent sarcophagus and a son named Adolf Hitler is born to Frau Klara Hitler.</p><p>On January 30, 1889, at the champagne-splashed height of the Viennese Carnival, the Handsome and charming Crown Prince Rudolf fired a revolver at his teenaged mistress and them himself.

Here then gone, a blur within the blur of color and speed, but it swelled in her heart like love.<br><br> Then came a sigh, and the echoes of sighs, another kind of music. Bittersweet. And this washed through her like tears.<br><br> So with joy and sorrow mated in her heart, she fell. Tumbling, spiraling, spinning in a breathless rush that added a reckless thrill and a quick panic.<br><br> A thousand wings beat now, a thousand and a thousand more, with whipping wind, a wall of sound. And color flicked away into the dark as she landed abruptly enough to lose her breath.<br><br> For a moment she feared they'd landed in some deep, dark cave where spiders would crawl, and worse, much worse, where Nerezza waited to strike.<br><br> Then her vision cleared. She made out shadows, what she knew as moonlight, and felt the firm body beneath hers, the arms wrapped tight around her. She knew that shape, that scent, wanted to snuggle right in, Nerezza or not.<br><br> It was a wonder, a star-struck sea of wonder, to feel his heart beat, so fast and strong, against hers.<br><br> Then he shifted a little, and one hand slid up, then down her hair. The other skimmed wonderfully over her bottom.<br><br> She snuggled right in.<br><br> "Um." Both hands came to her shoulders now, but his voice spoke close enough to her heart that his breath tickled it. "Are you okay? Are you hurt? Everybody okay?"<br><br> She remembered her friends-not that she'd forgotten them, not ever. But she'd never lain so intimately on a man before-on Sawyer-and she liked it very, very much.<br><br> She heard grunts, short groans, some cursing. Doyle's voice, close by and annoyed, clearly said, "Fuck me," which she knew wasn't an invitation to mate, but an oath.<br><br> She didn't worry about Doyle. After all, he was an immortal.<br><br> "Sound off." That was Bran, somewhere a few feet away. "Did everybody make it? I've got Sasha. Riley?"<br><br> "What a ride!"<br><br> "One you finished with your knee in my balls," Doyle added.<br><br> Annika heard a thump, which she interpreted as Doyle shoving Riley and her knee aside-as balls, she'd learned, weren't just the round toy that bounced, but a man's sensitive area.<br><br> "I'm here," she called out, and experimented by wiggling a little on Sawyer's sensitive area. "Did we fall out of the sky?"<br><br> "Not far from it." Sawyer cleared his throat and, to Annika's disappointment, shifted again and sat up. "I couldn't slow it down. I've never taken six people this far. I misjudged, I guess."<br><br> "We're here, the six of us, and that's first on the list," Bran stated. "Now, are we where we aimed to be?"<br><br> "We're inside," Sasha commented. "I can see windows, and moonlight through them. Wherever we are, it's still night."<br><br> "Let's hope Sawyer and his time- and space-bending compass got us where and when we want. So let's find out."<br><br> Riley pushed to her feet. The scientist-archaeologist. Annika rolled the word in her mind as her people, the merpeople, had nothing to compare. They had no lycans either, she thought, so nothing and no one quite like Riley existed in Annika's world.<br><br> Dr. Riley Gwin-tough, compact body, wide-brimmed hat that had somehow stayed on her head-strode to the window.<br><br> "I can see water, but not the view from the villa on Corfu-we're higher up. A road, steep, narrow. We've got steps leading down to it. I'm pretty sure this is Capri, and this is the villa. Bull's-eye, Sawyer. Kudos to the traveler and his magic compass."<br><br> "I'll take them." He stood, hesitated, then held out a hand to help Annika up. Though her legs were strong and agile, she let him.<br><br> "Let me see if I can find the lights," Riley began.<br><br> "I can help with that."<br><br> Bran, on his feet, an arm around Sasha, held out his hand. The ball of light hovering over his palm illuminated the room.<br><br> Seeing her friends lifted her heart as the song had. Sasha, the seer, with her hair like the sun and her eyes of the sky, and Bran, the sorcerer, so handsome with his magick lighting him. And Riley, one hand on the butt of the gun on her hip-at the ready-her dark gold eyes looking everywhere at once as Doyle, a warrior through and through, stood with his sword already drawn.<br><br> And Sawyer, always Sawyer, with the compass of the traveler in his hand.<br><br> They might be bruised and bloodied from the last battle, but they were safe and together.<br><br> "Is this our home now?" she wondered. "It's very pretty."<br><br> "Unless Sawyer dropped us at the wrong address, I say this is the new HQ." Though her hand stayed on her gun, Riley moved from the window.<br><br> The room had colorful cushions on a long bed-no, Annika reminded herself, a sofa. And chairs and tables with pretty lamps. The floor-they all had reason to know-was hard, with large tiles the color of sun-beaten sand.<br><br> Riley moved to one of the lamps, turned the switch and, with the magic of electricity, it lit.<br><br> "Let me get my bearings, make sure we're in the right place. We don't want a visit from the polizia."<br><br> Riley moved out of the room through a wide, arched opening. In seconds, more light poured through. Sheathing his sword, Doyle moved out after her.<br><br> "Here's all our stuff, at least it looks like all of it. And it looks like it had a softer landing than we did."<br><br> Annika peeked out. She didn't know what to call the space with its big door facing the sea, and the archways leading to other spaces. But their bags and boxes sat in a pile in the center of it.<br><br> And with a muttered curse, Doyle heaved his motorcycle upright.<br><br> "I had to drop the stuff first so we didn't end up landing on it," Sawyer said. "Bull's-eye or not, Riley?"<br><br> "It fits the description I got," Riley went on. "And the location. There's supposed to be a large living area with glass doors leading to a . . . And here we go."<br><br> More lights, and as Riley said, a large room with more of the sofas and chairs and pretty little things. But best, oh, best of all, the wide, wide glass to bring in the sky and sea.<br><br> When Annika rushed forward to open the glass, Riley stayed her hand.<br><br> "Don't. Not yet. There's an alarm system. I have the code. We need to turn it off before we open this, or anything else."<br><br> "Panel's right here," Sawyer told her, and tapped it.<br><br> "Give me a sec." Riley dug a piece of paper out of her pocket. "Didn't want to trust my memory in case the trip scrambled my brains."<br><br> "Shifting doesn't scramble brains." Grinning, Sawyer knocked his knuckles on Riley's head as she keyed in the code.<br><br> "Go ahead and open it, Annika."<br><br> When she did, she twirled out onto a wide terrace, where there was night and moon, sea and the scent of it all, all perfumed with lemons and flowers.<br><br> "It's beautiful! I've never seen it from so high."<br><br> "But you've seen it before?" Sawyer asked her. "Capri?"<br><br> "From the sea. And beneath, where there are blue caves and deep water and the bones of ships that sailed long ago. There are flowers!" She reached out to touch the petals of flowers spilling out of hefty pots in bright colors. "I can water and tend them. It can be my job."<br><br> "Deal. This is the place." With a satisfied nod, Riley set her hands on her hips. "Kudos again, Sawyer."<br><br> "We should check through it in any case." Bran stood at the opening, dark, intense eyes scanning the sky.<br><br> Nerezza often came from the sky.<br><br> "I'll be adding protection over the more usual alarm system," he continued. "We caused her pain, and harm, so it's unlikely she'll gather herself enough to come at us again tonight, if indeed she can find us. But we'll sleep better with a layer of magick over all."<br><br> "Split up." With his sword sheathed, his dark hair tumbled around his hard, handsome face, Doyle nodded agreement. "Go through the place, make certain it's clear and secured."<br><br> "Should be two bedrooms down here, four more upstairs, and another common space. It's not big and plush like the villa, and we won't have all that outdoor space."<br><br> "Or Apollo," Annika put in.<br><br> "Yeah." Riley smiled. "I'm going to miss that dog. But there's room, and it's well located. I'll take the upstairs."<br><br> "You just want first call on the bedrooms."<br><br> Riley grinned at Sasha, then frowned. "You okay, Sash? You're pale."<br><br> "Just a headache. A regular headache," she said when all eyes turned to her. "I don't try to fight the visions anymore. It's just been a very long day."<br><br> "And so it has." Bran drew her close to his side, whispered something in her ear that made her smile and nod. "We'll take upstairs as well," he said, and with Sasha, vanished.<br><br> "Oh, cheat! No fair using magick!" Riley charged toward the steps and up.<br><br> "Three up, so three down to clear this floor. I'd sooner bunk down here," Doyle said with a look around, "closer to the outside access."<br><br> "You and me down here then," Sawyer decided-to Annika's disappointment. "Closer to the kitchen and the food. Let's see what we've got."<br><br> The two bedrooms stood side by side. Not as big as the ones they'd left behind on Corfu, but with nice beds and pretty views from the windows.<br><br> "Works," Doyle stated.<br><br> "Works," Sawyer agreed after opening another door to a bathroom with a shower.<br><br> The door slid in and out of the wall, delighting Annika so she had to push it in, pull it out a few times before Sawyer grabbed her hand and pulled her away.<br><br> They found another room with what Sawyer called a bar, a big television on the wall (she loved television), and a large table where colorful balls stood in a triangle on a green top.<br><br> Annika stroked her hand over the top. "It isn't grass."<br><br> "Felt," Sawyer told her. "It's a pool table-a game. You play?" he asked Doyle.<br><br> "What man who's lived a few centuries hasn't played pool?"<br><br> "I've only lived a few decades, but I've played my share. We'll have to have a game."<br><br> There was a powder room-though no one powdered anything in them that Annika had seen-and then the kitchen and eating area. She knew immediately Sawyer was pleased.<br><br> He wandered through it. A tall, lean body that moved, she thought, as if never hurried. Her fingers wanted to brush through all the dark gold hair the sun had streaked, shaggy and windblown from the traveling. And eyes, gray like the sea in the first silver light of dawn, that made her want to sigh.<br><br> "The Italians understand cooking-and eating. This is excellent."<br><br> She knew something about cooking now, had even learned to make a few dishes, so she recognized the big stove with its many burners, and the ovens for baking and roasting. A center island held its own sink, which charmed her, and another sink-wider-stood under a window.<br><br> Sawyer opened the box that kept things cold-the refrigerator, she remembered. "Already stocked. Riley doesn't miss a trick. Beer?"<br><br> "Oh, absolutely," Doyle said.<br><br> "Anni?"<br><br> "I don't like the beer very much. Is there something else?"<br><br> "Got your soft drinks, some fruit juice. And wait." He pointed up to a rack holding bottles. "Wine."<br><br> "I like the wine."<br><br> "Got you covered then." He chose a bottle, passed a beer to Doyle, took one for himself, then wandered to a door. "Pantry, also stocked. We're in business."<br><br> He opened drawers until he found the tool to open the wine. Corkscrew-such a funny word.<br><br> "I don't know about anybody else, but I'm starved. Shifting that many that far, it hulls you out."<br><br> "I could eat," Doyle decided.<br><br> "I'm going to throw something together. Riley was right, Sasha looks pale. We'll eat, drink, decompress."<br><br> "Have at it then. I'm going to check outside." With his sword still sheathed on his back, Doyle went through another wide glass door.<br><br> "I can help you make the food."<br><br> "Don't you want to grab up a bedroom?"<br><br> "I like to help make the food." With you, most of all, she thought.<br><br> "Okay, let's keep it simple. Quick pasta, tossed with butter and herbs. And we've got . . . yeah, we've got tomatoes, mozzarella." He pulled the cheese from the refrigerator, handed her a tomato from the bowl on the counter. "You remember how to slice these up?"<br><br> "Yes, I can slice very well."<br><br> "You slice them up, then find a plate or tray or platter." He spread his hands to show her size.<br><br> He had strong hands, but was gentle with them. Annika thought gentleness was its own kind of strength.<br><br> "And you lay them out with the cheese on top of the tomato," he continued, so she knew to pay attention. "Drizzle this olive oil over them." He set a container on the counter.<br><br> "Drizzle is like rain, but only a little."<br><br> "You got it. Then you're going to take this." He walked over to the windowsill, where some pots sat, and broke off a stem with leaves. "It's basil."<br><br> "I remember. It adds flavor."<br><br> "Yeah. Chop it up some, sprinkle it over everything, grind a little pepper on there, too, and that's a wrap."<br><br> "It's a wrap."<br><br> "It's finished," he explained.<br><br> "I will wrap it for you."<br><br> Pleased, she braided her waist-length black hair back and away. She got to work while he put a pot of water on the stove, poured her wine, drank his beer.<br><br> She liked the quiet times with him, and had learned to savor them. There would be more fighting; she knew, accepted. There would be more pain. She would accept that, too. But she had been given a gift. The legs that allowed her to walk out of the sea and onto land, if only for a short time. The friends who were more precious than gold. The purpose that was her legacy and her duty.<br><br> And most of all, Sawyer, whom she'd loved before he even knew she existed.<br><br> "Do you dream, Sawyer?"<br><br> "What?" Distracted, he glanced back at her as he found a colander. "Sure. Sure, most everybody does."<br><br> "Do you dream of when we've done our duty, when we have all three stars? When the Stars of Fortune are safe from Nerezza? When there is no more fighting?"</p><h2>The Revised Grail Psalms: A Liturgical Psalter/G7882</h2><p>This important translation many years in the making is finally available to musicians, liturgists, and worshipers around the world.

Former SR-71 pilot, instructor and wing commander, Richard Graham, presents the most intriguing SR-71 stories ever told. This once highly classified program is fully revealed through the words of pilots, commanders, mechanics, and instructors involved in the Blackbird&#39;s creation and flight-testing. From grueling reconnaissance missions to the Persian Gulf conflict, this insightful book tells stories of bravery and daring determination.</p><p>For a quarter-century, Lockheed's Mach 3 SR-71A Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft dominated the skies as no other. The men that flew the 55-ton "Habu" (so dubbed by Okinawans near one of its bases because of its resemblance to a local deadly black snake) at 80,000 feet and 33 miles per minute were the rarest of fraternities, and author and former 9th Recon Wing commander Richard Graham provides a score of them--as well as key ground personnel--a generous forum for their self-penned recollections here. Where Graham's first book, <i>SR-71 Revealed: The Inside Story</i>, dealt more with the Blackbird's remarkable hardware and history, this volume details the human dimensions of the SR-71 program, from its dangerous days of development and testing through decades of intelligence-gathering operations in the world's hot spots, to its final, bittersweet confrontation with the one foe it couldn't elude: self-serving Pentagon politics. Inspired by flying a plane that often seemed to have a mind of its own--and a sometimes malicious one at that--the anecdotes here are seasoned with a compelling mix of boyish humor, sheer terror, and enviable camaraderie. As Graham's fellow SR-71 pilot and author Brian Shul once noted, more people have stood atop Mt. Everest than have flown what remains the world's fastest, highest-flying jet.

Vida Memorial Fund, set up to preserve Blackbird 972, whose 1990 transcontinental, record-setting retirement flight is recounted herein, currently housed at the Smithsonian Museum) --<i>Jerry McCulley</i></p><h2>The Penguin Jazz Guide: The History of the Music in the 1001 Best Albums</h2><p>Richard Cook and Brian Morton's Penguin Jazz Guide: The History of the Music in 1001 Best Albums is an indispensible guide to the recordings that every fan should know.

I was bent over the pool table with one hand in the bald patch behind the D, which Flynn the Barman claimed was beer, but which was the same size and shape as Mrs. Flynn the Barman's arse: nigh on a yard in the beam and formed like the cross-section of a cooking apple. The fluorescent over the table blinked out, then came back, and the glass-fronted fridge gave a low, lurching hum. The wiring buzzed&#x2014;and then it was dark. A faint sheen of static danced on the TV on its shelf, and the green exit lamp sputtered by the door.<br><br>I dropped my weight into the imprint of Mrs. Flynn the Barman's hams and played the shot anyway. The white ball whispered across the felt, came off two cushions, and clipped the eight cleanly into a side pocket. Doff, doff, tchk . . . glonk. It was perfect. On the other hand, I'd been aiming for the six. I'd given the game to Jim Hepsobah, and any time now when the power came back and everything was normal in the Nameless Bar, I'd pass the cue to my hero pal Gonzo, and Jim would beat him too.<br><br>Any time now.<br><br>Except that the lights stayed out, and the hollow glimmer of the TV set faded away. There was a small, quiet moment, the kind you just have time to notice, which makes you feel sad for no good reason. Then Flynn went out back, swearing like billy-o&#x2014;and if your man Billy-O ever met Flynn, if ever there was a cuss-off, a high noon kinduva thing with foul language, I know where my money'd be.<br><br>Flynn hooked up the generator, which God help us was pig-powered. There was the sound of four large, foul-smelling desert swine being yoked to a capstan, a noise pretty much like a minor cavalry war, and then Flynn let loose some of his most abominable profanity at the nearest porker. It looked as if it wanted to vomit and bolted. The others perforce followed it in a slow but steady progression about the capstan, and then pig number one came back around, saw Flynn ready with another dose and tried to stop. Lashed to the crosspiece and bundled along by its three fellows, it found it couldn't, so it gathered its flabcovered self and charged past him at piggy top speed, and the whole cycle accelerated until, with a malodorous, oinking crunch, the generator kicked in, and the television lit up with the bad news.<br><br>Or rather, it didn't light up. The picture was so dim that it seemed the set was broken. Then there were fireworks and cries of alarm and fear, very quiet but getting louder, and we realised Sally Culpepper was just now turning on the sound. The image shook and veered, and urgent men went past shouting get back, get clear, and ohshitlookatthatfuckerjesus, which they didn't even bother to bleep. In the middle distance, it looked as if maybe a figure was rolling on the ground. Something had gone absolutely, horribly awry in the world, and naturally some arsehole was present with a camera making himself 10k an hour hazard pay when he could have been rolling up his arsehole sleeves and saving a life or two. I knew a guy in the Go Away War who did just that, dumped the network's prized Digi VII in a latrine trench and hauled six civilians and a sergeant from a burning medical truck. Got the Queen's Honour back home and a P45 from his boss. He's in an institution now, is Micah Monroe, and every day two guys from the Veterans' Hospital come by and take him for a walk and make sure the medal's polished on its little stand by his bed. They're sweet old geezers, Harry and Hoyle, and they've got medals of their own and they figure it's the least they can do for a man who lost his mind to giving a damn. Harry's kid was in the medical truck, you see. One of the ones Micah couldn't reach.<br><br>We stared at the screen and tried to make sense of what was on it. It looked, for a moment, as if the Jorgmund Pipe was on fire&#x2014;but that was like saying the sky was falling. The Pipe was the most solidly constructed, triple-redundant, safety-first, one-of-a-kind necessary object in the world. We built it fast and dirty, because there was no other way, the gone-away world and then after that we made it indestructible. The plans were drawn up by the best, then checked and re-checked by the very best, and then the checkers themselves were scrutinised, analysed and vetted for any sign of fifth columnism or martyr tendencies, or even a serious and hitherto undetected case of just-plain-stupid, and then the contractors went to work under a scheme which emphasised thoroughness and adherence to spec over swift completion, and which imposed penalties so dire upon speculators and profiteers that it would actually be safer just to throw yourself from a high place, and finally the quantity surveyors and catastrophe experts went to town on it with hammers and saws, lightning generators and torsion engines, and declared it sound. Everyone in the Livable Zone was united in the desire to maintain and safeguard it. There was absolutely no chance that it could imaginably, conceivably, possibly be on fire.<br><br>It was on fire in a big way. The Pipe was burning painful white, magnesium, corpse-belly, nauseating white, and beside it there were buildings and fences, which meant this wasn't just the Pipe, but something even more important: a pumping station or a refinery. The whole place was wrapped in hot, shining smoke, and deep in the heart of the furnace there was stuff going on the human eye didn't know what to do with, weird, bad-news stuff which came with its own ominous soundtrack. On the screen something very important crumbled into noise and light.<br><br>"Fuuuuuuck," said Gonzo William Lubitsch, speaking for everyone.<br><br>It was a funny feeling: we were looking at the end of the world&#x2014; again&#x2014;and we were looking at something awful we'd never wanted to see, but at the same time we were looking at fame and fortune and just about everything we could ever ask for delivered by a grateful populace. We were looking at our reason for being. Because that thar on that thar screen was a fire, plus also a toxic event of the worst kind, and we, Ladies and Gentlemen, put your hands together, were the Haulage &amp; HazMat Emergency Civil Freebooting Company of Exmoor County (corporate HQ the Nameless Bar, CEO Sally J. Culpepper, presiding) and this was the thing that we did better than anyone else in the entire Livable Zone, and therefore anywhere. Sally was straightaway talking to Jim Hepsobah and then to Gonzo, making lists and giving orders. <br><br>She set Flynn the Barman to brewing his chews-through-steel espresso, and at last even Mrs. Flynn was up off her on-board cushions and moving at flank speed to make provisions, prepare tallies, and take letters for loved ones and estranged ones and people glimpsed and admired across the floating ash of the Nameless Bar. We ran to and fro and bumped into one another and swore, mostly because we didn't have anything important to do yet, and there was hubbub and brouhaha until Sally jumped up on the pool table and told us to shut up and get it together. She raised her phone above our heads like the thigh bone of a saint.<br><br>Sally Culpepper was six feet tall and much of her was leg, and on her right shoulder blade she had an orchid tattoo inked by some kid a quarter-inch shy of Michelangelo. She had strawberry lips and creamy skin and freckles across her nose where it'd been rebuilt after a bar fight in Lisbon. Gonzo claimed to have slept with her, to have had those legs wrapped around his hips like conjoined Italian calf-skin boa constrictors. He said she left him all but dead and grinning like a crescent moon. He said it happened one night after a big job, beer running from the rafters and everyone shiny as an egg yolk with success and soap-scoured skin. He said it was that time when Jim and Sally were trying not to be a thing, before they just gave in to the inevitable and got a place together. Every time we all met up, me and Gonzo and Sally and Jim Hepsobah and the others, Gonzo'd throw her a wicked grin and ask her how her other tattoo was, and Sally Culpepper would smile a secret smile which said she wasn't telling, and maybe he knew what that other tattoo looked like and maybe he didn't. Jim Hepsobah just pretended he hadn't heard, because Jim loved Gonzo like a brother, and love like that recognises that your buddy can be an ass, and doesn't care. We all loved Sally Culpepper, and she ruled us with her transparent lashes and her milkmaid's face and her slender arms that could drop a punch on you like a steam hammer. So there she stood, and there was a reasonable facsimile of calm and attention, because we knew that if the call came it would come on that phone, and we knew she had five-offive reception here, and that was one of the reasons why the Nameless Bar was our place of business.<br><br>So we stopped hunting for lost socks and packing bags, and fretting that we'd somehow miss the starting gun, and settled in to Mrs. Flynn's provender. After a while we got quietly chatty and talked about small domestic chores, like cleaning gutters and chasing bats out of the loft. When the phone did ring (any time now), we could go and be heroes and save the world, which was Gonzo's favourite thing, and perforce something I did from time to time as well. Until it kicked off, we might as well not fuss. And then the Nameless Bar went quiet again; in little groups and one by one we fell silent as we beheld a vision of awful destiny.<br><br>The vision took the form of a small child carrying a snot-crusted and elderly teddy bear. It marched out into the room with much gravitas, surveyed us all sternly, then turned to Mrs. Flynn the Barman to gather in details for the prosecution.<br><br>"Why was it all dark?" it demanded.<br><br>"The power went out," Mrs. Flynn the Barman said cheerfully.<br><br>"There's a fire." The child glowered around the room.<br><br>"These are loud men," it said, still annoyed, "and this one is dirty."<br><br>It indicated Gonzo, who winced. It considered Sally Culpepper.<br><br>"This lady has a flower on her back," it added, having found conclusive proof of our unsuitability, then sat down in the middle of the floor and helped itself to a cheese and bacon roll. We goggled at it, and tried to make it go away by rubbing our eyes.<br><br>"Sorry," Mrs. Flynn the Barman said to us in general. "We don't let him in here normally, but it's an emergency." She eyed the child without approval. "Sweetie, you can't eat that; it's been on the floor near the dirty man."<br><br>Gonzo would probably have objected to this, but he didn't seem to hear her; he was still gazing in mute horror at the kid in front of him, and so was I, and so was everyone else. It was unquestionably a human toddler, and from the context certain conclusions had to be drawn which were uncomfortable and even appalling. This infant, swaddled in a bath towel and presently attempting to jam a four-inch-diameter granary bap into one ear, was the Spawn of Flynn.<br><br>Now, the fire on the Jorgmund Pipe was deeply unsettling. It represented danger and opportunity and almost certainly deceptions and agendas and what all. It was, however, well within our common understanding.<br><br>Things burned, things exploded, and then we came along and made them stop. A breeding population of Flynns was another proposition altogether. We looked on Flynn as our personal monster, a safe, disturbing ogre of corrosive profanity and sinister glassware. He was ours and he was mighty and we grew great by association with him, and proof of his dangerous overmanliness was to be found in his fearless sexual trystings with the vasty Mrs. Flynn, but we didn't really want to live in a world entirely composed of Flynn-like beings in their serried ranks, vituperative and grouchy and unwilling to take an IOU. That was a new order even the bravest of us would find inhospitable, and the glimmer of it, the Spawn of Flynn, was even now throwing pieces of mushed-up cheese at Gonzo's boot. Mrs. Flynn the Barman, oblivious, finished whatever domestic task she was about amid a flurry of folding cloths and wiping, and trotted out. The Spawn of Flynn blithely ignored his mother and took a chomp from the side of the soiled roll.<br><br>"Crunchy," said the Spawn of Flynn.<br><br>Sally Culpepper's phone made a little chirrup, and everyone pointedly didn't look.<br><br>"Culpepper," Sally murmured, and then, after a moment, snapped it shut. "Wrong number." We all made faces to suggest we weren't fussed.<br><br>For a while, the Nameless Bar was filled with the sound of a small child eating and a lot of rough and tough-talking men and women thinking perturbed and unfamiliar thoughts about time and mortality and family. Then the quiet was broken, not by a phone call but by a sound so deep it was very nearly not a sound at all.<br><br>You heard it first as a kind of aggressive quiet. The whoosh and snarl of the desert all around us was still going on, but somehow it was subsumed by this deep, bass silence. Then you could feel it as a coldness in your knees and ankles, an unsteady, heart-attack feeling of weakness and vibration. A bit later it was audible, a thrumming gnognognogg which echoed in your lungs and let you know you were a prey animal today. And if you'd ever heard it before you knew what it was, and we all knew, because when we'd first met it was the noise we'd made together: the sound of soldiers. Someone was deploying a decent-sized military force around the Nameless Bar, and that meant they were emphatically not kidding about security. Since it seemed unlikely that they were deploying in order to arrest us, and since in any case if they were there would be absolutely nothing we could do about it, we all crowded through the big pine door of the Nameless Bar to watch them arrive.<br><br>Outside, it was cold and dry. The night had set in, witching-hour black, and the sands had given up their heat, so a chill wind was gusting across the wooden rooftops of the bar and the outbuildings, and the gloomy shacks and clapboard homes which made up the no-hope town of Exmoor, pop. 1,309. Off against the brow of Millgram's Hill was our section of the Jorgmund Pipe; a single shadow-grey line lit by Flynn's bedroom window and the work light in the paddock, and every now and again by the gleam of another lonely little house along the way. It ran in both directions into the dark, and somewhere on the other side of the globe those two lines met and joined, surely at a place which was as vibrant and alive as Exmoor was not. On the top of the Pipe, every few metres, there was a little nozzle spraying good, clean FOX into the sky; FOX, the magic potion which kept the part of the world we still had roughly the same shape day by day. No one quite knew where it came from or how you made it; most people imagined some big machine like an egg with all manner of wires and lights condensing it out of air and moonshine, and drip-drip-dripping it into big vats. There were thousands of them, somewhere, vulnerable and vital, and let them never stop. I'd once seen some of the machinery involved: long black lozenges with curved sides, all plumbing and hoses, and rather eerie. Less an egg than a space capsule or a bathyscaphe, except this was the opposite; not a thing for journeying through a hostile place, but a thing which makes what is outside less hostile.<br><br>Most people tried very har...</p><h2>Jewish Wisdom: Ethical, Spiritual, and Historical Lessons from the Great Works and Thinkers</h2><p><li>When, if ever, should lying be permitted? </li><li>If you've damaged a person's reputation unfairly, can the damage be undone?</li><li>Is a person who sells weapons responsible for how those weapons are used?</li><li>if the fetus is not a life, what is it?

Rabbi Joseph Telushkin has devoted his life to the search for answers within the teachings of Judaism. In Jewish Wisdom, Rabbi Telushkin, the author of the highly acclaimed Jewish Literacy, weaves together a tapestry of stories from the Bible and Talmud, and the insights of Jewish commentators and writers from Maimonides, Rashi, and Hillel to Einstein, Isaac Bashevis Singer, and Elie Wiesel. A richer source of crucial life lessons would be hard to imagine.</p><p>Accompanying this extraordinary compilation is Teluslikins compelling commentary, which reveals how these texts continue to instruct and challenge Jewsand all people concerned with leading ethical livestoday As he discusses these texts, Rabbi Telushkin addresses issues of fundamental interest to modern readers: how to live with honesty and integrity in an often dishonest world; how to care for the sick and dying; how to teach children to respect both themselves </p><p>and others, how to understand and confront such great tragedies as antisemitism. and the Holocaust; what God wants from humankind. Within Jewish Wisdom's ninety chapters the reader will find extended sections illuminating Jewish perspectives on sex, romance, and marriage, what kind of belief in God a Jew can have after the Holocaust, how to use language ethically, the conflicting views of the Bible and Talmud on the death penalty, and much, much more.</p><p>Jewish Wisdom adds a new dimension to the many widely read contemporary books that retell the stones and reveal the essence of classic religious and secular literature. Possibly the most far-ranging volume of stories and quotations from Jewish texts, Jewish Wisdom will itself become a classic, a book that not only has the capacity to transform how you view the world, but one that well might change how you choose to live your life.</p></p><p><p>Joseph Telushkin is a rabbi, scholar, and bestselling author of eighteen books, among them <em>A Code of Jewish Ethics</em> and <em>Words That Hurt, Words That Heal</em>. His book <em>Jewish Literacy</em> is the widest-selling work on the topic of Judaism. He lives with his wife, Dvorah, in New York City, and lectures regularly throughout the United States.</p>Organized by subject, this is a collection of teachings and quotations from the Talmud, the Bible, rabbinical commentaries, and ancient and modern religious and secular writings. Writers include Elie Wiesel, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Hebrew poet Hayim Bialik, Cynthia Ozick, Emile Zola, Albert Einstein, Bruno Bettelheim, Gertrude Stein, Irving Howe, and Maimonides. In commentary that explains why these teachings remain meaningful to Jews today, Rabbi Telushkin addresses such issues as relationships between people; individuals and their quest for meaning; what God wants from us; the modern Jewish experience; and Jewish values as they confront the Holocaust, Zionism, and Israel. Telushkin's commentaries are especially helpful because of the myriad quotations from the Talmud. There are also anti-Semitic quotations from Pharaoh and Haman (the first two recorded anti-Semites), from Voltaire, Hitler, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, H. L. Mencken, Gen. Ulysses Grant, Henry Ford, Charles Lindberg, and Louis Farrakhan, to name a few. But there is much wisdom here.

Yet healing is an exact, and an exacting, science; and in modern society no physician or surgeon may practice the ancient profession of healing without the personal qualifications legally recognised by the State for the protection of the public. No doubt prayer and invocation can be effective under certain circumstances, particularly when the one who serves is pure and harmless in motive, and has enough understanding to cooperate with the soul purposes of the individual, so permitting the healing energy of the soul to flow more freely and effectively through the personality, or to proceed with the process of withdrawal, if that is its immediate purpose. </p><p><br>Esoteric healing, however, includes far more than this; it is a science based on a number of requirements, including knowledge of the constitution of man and the nature of the various bodies, both dense and subtle. To this practical knowledge, the science of occultism contributes vital information of the energy factors, the karmic and ray influences, the psychology and astrology of the soul, and the laws and rules fundamental to the safe and successful practice of esoteric healing. </p><p> <br>With all this to encompass in understanding and in application, little wonder that this science is as yet in its infancy, still in the experimental stages, and with other aspects of esotericism due for major development only as the soul in man takes a stronger hold of all personality affairs. </p><p><br>In this book the seven ray techniques of healing are described; the laws and rules of healing are enumerated and discussed; the requirements for healing are given in detail; and basic causes of disease are shown. We learn, for example, that much disease can be karmic in origin; that certain diseases are inherent in the soil and in the substance of the planet; and that many others are psychological, arising in the emotional or mental bodies. Hence the need for a total and comprehensive understanding both of the patient and of the correct and safe methods of healing. </p><p> <br>We are also given a true understanding of death as the abstraction, or the withdrawal, of the soul from the body to continue life on its own plane without the limitation of the body, until a new cycle of incarnation and experience in form is necessary. </p><p> <br>In the effort to apply the teaching given in "Esoteric Healing", those whose destiny lies in this area of human service will begin to unfold the spiritual faculty necessary for the healing of the whole man. And this will increasingly concern groups of workers using the magnetic and radiatory power of group energy and invocation. The right practice of esoteric healing conforms, therefore, to the new age development of group consciousness, and the establishment of right energy relationships which underlie all aspects of esoteric training in the world today. Not only the potential healer, but all occultists will learn much from a study of "Esoteric Healing".</p></p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.</p><h2>Just As I Thought</h2><p><p>This rich and multifaceted collection is Grace Paley's vivid record of her life. As close to an autobiography as anything we are likely to have from this quintessentially American writer, <i>Just As I Thought</i> gives us a chance to see Paley not only as a writer and "troublemaker" but also as a daughter, sister, mother, and grandmother. Through her descriptions of her childhood in the Bronx and her experiences as an antiwar activist to her lectures on writing and her recollections of other writers, these pieces are always alive with Paley's inimitable voice, humor, and wisdom.</p></p><p>With their loopy sense of humor, pervasive sorrow, and Lower East Side vernacular, Grace Paley's stories have earned her a permanent place in American literature. Now her publisher has collected almost three decades of essays, reviews, and lectures, which amount to cumulative, if oblique, self-portrait. "This is not an autobiographical collection," she writes in her introduction, "but it is about my life." Since Paley's life has encompassed not only literature but a long involvement in politics, there are pungent takes on the women's movement, anti-nuke protests, and Vietnam. Yet she's too hard-headed to write even a single sentence of polemical drivel; her political prose is always personal. Here, for example, she attends a Quaker sit-in at the Seabrook nuclear site: "I'm not very good at Friends meetings. My mind refuses to prevent my eyes from looking at the folks around me, and I'm often annoyed because I can't get the drift of the murmur of private witness. I did hear one young man near me say, 'May your intercession here today be the fruit of our action.' I think this means 'God helps those that help themselves,' a proverb that sounds meaner than it really is." And when it comes to literature and writing, Paley is tremendous. Her short essays on Isaac Babel and Donald Barthelme are themselves worth the price ofpurchase. In <i>Just As I Thought</i>, the author accomplishes exactly what she ascribes to Babel, producing "clarity, presentness, tension, and a model of how always, though with great difficulty, to proceed."<p><b>Grace Paley</b> (1922-2007) is well known as a poet, feminist, writer, and antiwar activist.

You&#x2019;d get no special treatment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;d kill the guy, just shoot him a little.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;d spend less time in jail. With good behavior you&#x2019;d be out in seven to ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I still have a badge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take a close look at your solid-gold, honorary-detective-first-class badge that was given to you by our former commissioner, now mayor. It&#x2019;s not engraved with the words &#x2018;Authorized to shoot anybody who annoys him.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not even double-parkers who block my garage door?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Especially not them.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone&#x2019;s cell phone rang and he looked at the number. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Joan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She never calls at this time of night. I&#x2019;d better get it. Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Joan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I have caller ID.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve made a tiny little mistake,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; Stone moaned. He covered the phone. &#x201c;Joan says she&#x2019;s made a tiny little mistake,&#x201d; he said to his companions. &#x201c;That means she&#x2019;s made a real whopper of a mistake.&#x201d; He went back to the phone. &#x201c;All right, let me have it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s good news and bad news,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The good news is that I forgot to put a board meeting of the Arrington Group on your calendar.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone was immediately suspicious. &#x201c;And what is the bad news?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The meeting is tomorrow,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;At noon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I can probably get out of bed early enough to make that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not all the bad news.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; Stone said, mostly to himself.</p><p>&#x201c;You already said that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the rest of the bad news?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The board meeting is in Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rome is up the Hudson somewhere, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not that Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rome, Georgia? Rome has an airport. I could fly myself down there tomorrow morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Think farther east.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Not <i>that </i>Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That one. Now don&#x2019;t say, &#x2018;Oh, God&#x2019; again, and don&#x2019;t panic&#x2014;there&#x2019;s an Alitalia flight tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In, let&#x2019;s see, fifty-four minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which airport?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;JFK.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a forty-five-minute drive,&#x201d; he pointed out.</p><p>&#x201c;And Fred is off tonight, he went to the theater.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never make it,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Think about this: you&#x2019;re sitting next to the guy with the fastest car in town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on a minute.&#x201d; He turned to Dino. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to be at JFK in fifty-four minutes to catch a plane to Rome. Can I borrow your car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean the one with the flashing lights on top?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can see the headlines in tomorrow&#x2019;s <i>Post</i>,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;POLICE COMMISH LOANS OFFICIAL CAR TO SCHMUCK, WHO IS INVOLVED IN TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fifty-three minutes!&#x201d; Joan shouted from the other end of the phone call.</p><p>&#x201c;Only if I&#x2019;m in the car with you,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;That would shorten the headline to, SCHMUCK HITCHES RIDE WITH COMMISH.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You two better get going,&#x201d; Viv said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not coming with us?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d scream all the way,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Go on, get your asses in gear! I&#x2019;ll get the check.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you en route with further instructions,&#x201d; he said to Joan, then hung up and ran for the door, followed closely by Dino.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>Dino got into the backseat of the black SUV with Stone and slammed the door. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got fifty-one minutes to make a flight at JFK,&#x201d; he said to his driver. &#x201c;Punch it, and use the siren and the lights.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God bless you,&#x201d; Stone said, patting him on the knee.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bring God into this, and don&#x2019;t put your hand on my knee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want me to shoot him, boss?&#x201d; the detective in the front passenger seat asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not unless he does it again. You get on the horn to security at Kennedy and tell them I want to drive onto the ramp. Find out what gate the Alitalia flight to Rome is occupying, and tell them to stand by for an arriving passenger, Barrington.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; The detective whipped out his phone.</p><p>Stone dialed Joan&#x2019;s number.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Am I on the flight?&#x201d; he shouted over the siren.</p><p>&#x201c;You are&#x2014;you got the last seat, and I ordered you a car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. I need a room at the Hassler in Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already called them and talked to the night man. It&#x2019;s the middle of the night there, but he&#x2019;s promised to have you a bed, he just can&#x2019;t promise you a suite.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the board meeting tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In a conference room at the Hassler.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When did we get notice of the meeting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really need to know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe ten days ago. I got busy and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, go upstairs to my dressing room and pack the following, ready?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shoot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Use the two medium-sized cases. Pack a blue suit, a chalk-stripe, and&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know, maybe a tuxedo, pleated shirt, and black tie. Pack the black alligator oxfords, six pairs of boxers, six pairs of black socks, half a dozen linen handkerchiefs, and six shirts that go with the suits and half a dozen ties, and include my travel toiletries kit. Oh, shit, I don&#x2019;t have my passport. Find it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you wearing your blue blazer with the yacht club buttons?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Try the left inside pocket.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone slapped his chest, rummaged in the pocket, and came up with the alligator passport case. &#x201c;Got it. How did you know where it was?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When the new one came in the mail, I saw you put it there. What else do you need?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A briefcase&#x2014;the black alligator one, and all the stuff that&#x2019;s in it. You might make sure there&#x2019;s a legal pad in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. What else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it cold in Rome?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s spring, and Rome is a subtropical climate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No coat, then. What&#x2019;s the agenda for the board meeting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fax it to you before I go to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;FedEx the luggage, so it&#x2019;ll be there the day after tomorrow. I&#x2019;ll make do until then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have a good trip.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bye.&#x201d; Stone hung up and looked around. They were on what looked like the Van Wyck Expressway, and cars were scattering before them. &#x201c;I like this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This is how to go to the airport.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky it isn&#x2019;t rush hour,&#x201d; the driver said.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s lucky he knows me,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>&#x201c;I know you, and I love you, Dino.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is his hand on your knee again, boss?&#x201d; the detective asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He knows better than that now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shucks, I was counting on shooting him.&#x201d;</p><p>They were off the expressway and onto the labyrinth of roads around the airport. They stopped at a gate, which rolled back to admit them, and a security guard gave them the gate number and directions.</p><p>&#x201c;You can turn off the siren now,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;But keep the lights on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gotcha, boss.&#x201d; The driver floored it, and two minutes later they pulled up next to a giant airplane, connected to the terminal by a snaking boarding tunnel.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Dino,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I owe you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send you a bill. Now get your ass on the plane&#x2014;it was supposed to push back three minutes ago.&#x201d;</p><p>A security guard waved Stone to a door, and he ran up a flight of stairs, emerging in the tunnel near the aircraft door. A flight attendant awaited, his hand on the door. &#x201c;Any luggage, Mr. Barrington?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;None,&#x201d; Stone said, entering the airplane.</p><p>&#x201c;Just a moment.&#x201d; He closed the door behind them, turned right, and started down an aisle. They were in the tourist cabin, and the attendant was pointing at a seat right in the middle of the airplane.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a minute&#x2014;no first class?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;The flight is full. This is it.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone sighed and squeezed past the knees of two very large passengers and flopped into the seat. An extremely fat man sat to his left, taking up the entire armrest. &#x201c;Welcome aboard,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Stone looked to his right and found a woman of reasonable proportions.</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you the lucky guy?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Not lucky enough,&#x201d; Stone said, trying to find something to do with his left arm. &#x201c;How long is this flight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For me, nine hours. For you, forever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Too right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Hedy Kiesler,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Actually Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, but only my mother calls me that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All of it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just Hedwig. If you call me anything but Hedy, I&#x2019;ll hurt you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe you,&#x201d; Stone said, offering a hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Stone Barrington.&#x201d;</p><p>She leaned in. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you made it. I thought I was going to have to deal with the fat guy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard that!&#x201d; the fat guy said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>The airplane was moving backward; after a moment an engine started. A female flight attendant appeared. &#x201c;Mr. Barrington? I have two seats for you and your companion in first class.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What companion?&#x201d; Hedy asked Stone.</p><p>&#x201c;I think she means you. Join me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You bet your sweet ass,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The two of them struggled past the two fat men. &#x201c;Good riddance,&#x201d; one of them said. &#x201c;Move over one, George.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone, followed by Hedy, walked up the aisle and was shown to the first pair of seats at the front of the cabin. &#x201c;You can have the window,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry we couldn&#x2019;t seat you sooner,&#x201d; the attendant said, &#x201c;but the seats were booked by someone else who didn&#x2019;t show. I had to wait until we closed the door and pushed back before giving them to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Hedy eased into her seat. &#x201c;God, what a relief,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do you always fly like this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, usually I fly myself in a light jet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had to leave on short notice for a board meeting tomorrow in Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of board?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A hotel group. What takes you to Rome?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a painter. I&#x2019;ve taken an apartment for a month, and I&#x2019;m going to paint Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any canvases or paints.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I shipped all that ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your apartment?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the Pantheon district.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you staying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At the Hassler Villa Medici.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Very </i>nice.&#x201d;</p><p>The airplane rolled onto the runway and accelerated. Shortly, the attendant brought them dinner menus.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starved,&#x201d; Hedy said, opening the menu. &#x201c;How about you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had a first course before my secretary called and told me I had to go to Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No luggage?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not even a briefcase. I was lucky my passport was in my jacket pocket. Can I buy you a drink?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Several,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m terrified of flying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look terrified.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;re a calming influence,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I know bourbon is.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone ordered two double bourbons.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3</p><p>The cabin lights came on, and a voice blared over the loudspeakers, first in Italian, then: &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, we will land in Rome in approximately one hour. Breakfast will now be served.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone realized there was a head on his shoulder. She made a noise and sat up. &#x201c;Did she say breakfast?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We ordered it last night, don&#x2019;t you remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I remember only bourbon, but I don&#x2019;t remember how many.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask.&#x201d;</p><p>A flight attendant set omelets before them and they ate hungrily.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you feel?&#x201d; Stone asked when their plates had been taken away.</p><p>&#x201c;Nearly human.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>They deplaned and walked toward baggage claim. She was pulling a carry-on.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have any checked luggage?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I sent it with the painting stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Smart. Can I give you a lift into the city?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>They walked through customs without incident, and Stone saw a man holding a sign with his name on it. A couple of minutes later they were in a large Mercedes sedan.</p><p>&#x201c;You travel well,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What do you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an attorney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What firm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Woodman &amp; Weld.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They represent my stepfather,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s your stepfather?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His name is Arthur Steele.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m his lawyer. I represent the Steele insurance group.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe this is where I say, &#x2018;Small world.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not yet&#x2014;my mother was a painter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was her name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Matilda Stone.

She peered across the fire at the pile of hides covering Bright Moon's body. The draft that sneaked in around the lodge skirts created patterns in the thick bed of glowing red coals and cast a ruby light over the inside of the lodge. She could see Bright Moon's face; her mother finally slept.<i>My mother? Curious. I can hardly remember my life before Sage Ghost stole me from the Three Forks camp. I belong here, among the White Clay people, now. Owlclover might have borne me--but Bright Moon loved me more</i>. White Ash rubbed a nervous hand over her face and looked at the old woman who now slept so fitfully. <i>And all I can do is sit here and watch her die.</i>"Thank you for everything, Bright Moon," she whispered softly in sorrow. If only Sage Ghost hadn't left with the other men in a desperate attempt to find game. She closed her eyes, grief a physical pain, like a gnashing of teeth in her chest. Bright Moon would be dead before he returned.For eight winters White Ash had lived with the White Clay. Of those years, the first six had been wonderful. As she'd grown, she'd learned the ways and language of the Sun People. The White Clay had moved south from the Bug River, all the way to the Fat Beaver, to avoid the raiding in the north.She smiled as she remembered carefree days of golden sunshine in the summer and cozy, warm lodges in the winter. Through all of them, Bright Moon's face had beamed with love for her. She'd played with Wind Runner and Brave Manand the other children. They'd run and told jokes and hunted for mice and rabbits.White Ash shook her head, the smile on her lips bittersweet. Three years ago things had begun to change. Rumors had circulated down the trail that the other clans were beginning to move south, seeking new territory. The White Clay warriors had strutted among the lodges, thumping their chests, growling threats about what they'd do if the other clans came near.Then the Black Point clan attacked the camp on the Fat Beaver River and caught everyone by surprise. The White Clay had fled in horrified confusion and come unraveled, splitting into three factions. Defeat after defeat had thinned what remained of their ranks. But the people had never been as desperate as they now were. War visited them again, bringing death and privation. Hunger stalked the camp, reflected in the gaunt faces of the children and elders. The cold seemed to intensify, rending their bodies with talons of ice. Hope had fled with the ghost of summer.<i>Hope? How can I hope? What have I done to deserve this? What hope will there be for White Ash?</i> She closed her eyes and shook her head, trying to escape the images in the Dreams. She forced herself to relive the days when she and Wind Runner and Brave Man had laughed and told each other what they hoped for the future. The sun had been brighter then. The meat racks had bent under the weight of rich red slabs. The White Clay had been whole, powerful. Smiling faces peered at her from the past--faces of people dead or vanished with the breakup of the clan. Faces now as remote as those of her native Earth People.Bright Moon made a gasping noise that withered White Ash's spirit. <i>Sage Ghost, maybe it's better that you don't know.</i>She leaned forward, propping her chin on one knee, staring dully at the spot where Sage Ghost's bedding should have been. Various parfleches--collapsible rawhide bags--had been stacked around the bottom against the skirting of the lodge to act as extra insulation from the stinging cold. The dogs slept outside but their packs stayed in, away from eager teeth,be they canine or packrat--assuming one of the wily rodents made it that far past the famished dogs. Peeled poles, where they supported the finely sewn hides of the lodge cover, gleamed in the crimson light. Through the smoke hole she could see the stars, wavering as the hot air made a mirage of the soot-stained hole.Tired, deadly tired. Her soul ached. Could this really be happening to her? She glanced at the mounded robes where Bright Moon lay. How long had it been? An eternity?No, only two long days since Sage Ghost had left with the other men in another attempt to find game--anything to augment the dwindling supplies of food. They shouldn't have come out here in the middle of the basin in the first place. Sage Ghost had told Whistling Hare that starvation and the Wolf People lurked here.But who remained sane among the battered remains of the White Clay? They were but one small band of the Sun People, harried, constantly pushed farther south by the Broken Stones, the Hollow Flute, and the Black Point. The northern bands had grown, swelling in size until they strained the hunting grounds and stripped berry bushes of fruit.The clans weren't the only threat. The Wolf People, who lived in the Grass Meadow Mountains to the east, hated the Sun People. Only a week ago they'd ruthlessly raided a Sun camp, sweeping through the village like a swarm of enraged buffalo, burning lodges and murdering everyone in their path. They'd even killed the women and little children, and brutally slashed open the wombs of pregnant mothers to rip the babies from their bodies. Fear stalked the clans of the Sun People like a malignant demon. To the west, the Sheep Hunters, who hunted in the Red Rock Mountains, had warned the White Clay what would happen if anyone foolishly pushed into the canyons in their range. In a world gone hostile, the only hope for survival lay to the south, beyond the Sideways Mountains ... maybe somewhere beyond the land of the Earth People.While the men hunted, the women trekked long, circuitous routes to check snares and look for concentrations of jackrabbits that might be driven into a trap. The endless, nagging cold continued.<i>And I have to face Bright Moon's death alone.</i>The day after Sage Ghost left, the chill had awakened her, eating through the robes, bringing her out of another of the strange Dreams. She'd blinked, wondering why Bright Moon--who took such pride and delight at offering tea to early risers--would have let the fire die. She'd blinked in the gray light and sat up."Bright Moon?" she'd called softly and heard no answer. She reached over to the silent bundle and lifted the hides.Bright Moon lay on her side, eyes glazed by a terrible fear. Her gray hair spilled loosely over the furs, contrasting with the red tones of fox hair under her head."Bright Moon?"A desperate croak had come from her foster mother's throat.White Ash had panicked and thrown on her frost-stiff clothing before stumbling out into the mauve light to run flat-out for old Flying Squirrel's lodge.The old woman's reputation as the real leader of the band had grown through the years. Her husband, Whistling Hare, might pronounce the decisions, but most people suspected that Flying Squirrel lay behind each and every one. Not that people minded Whistling Hare's leadership; they respected his counsel--and, of course, Flying Squirrel's--and generally did as he advised.Flying Squirrel had pulled a robe about her thin shoulders and hurried across the snowbound camp. Wind whipped the old woman's silvered braids; the expression on her lined face had gone grim as her feet crunched through the grainy snow. She'd ducked into the lodge and stoopped to pull Bright Moon's blanket back. "Bright Moon?"Only the frightened eyes had moved, tears welling in their corners."Can you hear me?" Flying Squirrel had persisted.Bright Moon mumbled something, lips not moving, eyes darting this way and that."Rest, old friend. We will make a fire and get you something to eat." And she'd turned, beckoning White Ash to follow.Outside, beyond earshot, Flying Squirrel faced White Ash, weary resignation in her old eyes. With a callus-horned hand, she rubbed her long face, rearranging the patterns of wrinkles. "I've seen this before. It's soul splitting."White Ash drew a quick breath, stiffening. "Her soul's separating from her body? You mean like what happened to old No Teeth?"Flying Squirrel nodded. "I don't know why. It just happens among the White Clay--more so than among other people. Sometimes it's just one side of the body, and maybe it gets better through time. But with Bright Moon ... Listen, girl, I've walked this earth for six tens of summers and a little more. When it's this bad, it's usually only days until the soul leaves all the way."White Ash swallowed against her thudding heart. "We need a Soul Flier to sing for her ... to heal her. We'd better send a runner after Old Falcon. Maybe if he comes back from the hunt, he can Sing her soul back into ... Why are you looking at me that way?"The tenderness in Flying Squirrel's expression deepended. "Because, child, I know you love her. I know what a blessing it's been to Bright Moon to have you these last eight years. But there's nothing we can do."White Ash shook frantic fists. "But if Old Falcon--""Shhh! Which of the boys would you send? Young Drummer? He's barely fourteen summers old. He knows how to stay alive, but with all the trouble we've had, do you think the men left a trail? Hmm? And you know how it is in early spring. Warm in the morning and blowing snow like crazy in the afternoon. And what if the men find a herd of buffalo? Would you have Old Falcon leave them and come running back? Would you risk the Power of the hunt?""But she's <i>dying</i>!""Yes, girl. She is. And if you don't get that fire started in the lodge, she'll freeze to death first. Come on, I have some embers you can carry back. The fire looked stone dead. You take care of her and let us do the rest. We all love Bright Moon. We'll all help."&lt;...</p><h2>Ulysses S. Grant: The Unlikely Hero (Eminent Lives)</h2><p><p>One of the first two volumes in Harper's <em>Eminent Lives</em> series, Korda brings his acclaimed storytelling talents to the life of Ulysses S. Grant &#x2013; a man who managed to end the Civil War on a note of grace, serve two terms as president, write one of the most successful military memoirs in American literature, and is today remembered as a brilliant general but a failed president.</p><p> Ulysses S. Grant was the first officer since George Washington to become a four&#x2013;star general in the United States Army, and the only president between Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson to serve eight consecutive years in the White House. In this succinct and vivid biography, Michael Korda considers Grant's character and reconciles the conflicting evaluations of his leadership abilities. </p><p> Grant's life played out as a true Horatio Alger story. Despite his humble background as the son of a tanner in Ohio, his lack of early success in the army, and assorted failed business ventures, his unwavering determination propelled him through the ranks of military leadership and into the presidency. But while the general's tenacity and steadfastness contributed to his success on the battlefield, it both aided and crippled his effectiveness in the White House. </p><p> Assessing Grant both within the context of his time and in contrast to more recent American leaders, Korda casts a benevolent eye on Grant's presidency while at the same time conceding his weaknesses. He suggests that though the general's second term ended in financial and political scandals, the fact remains that for eight years Grant exerted a calming influence on a country that had only just emerged from a horrendous civil war. Ulysses S. Grant is an even&#x2013;handed and stirring portrait of a man who guided America through a pivotal juncture in its history. </p></p><p><p>Michael Korda is the author of <em>Ulysses S. Grant</em>, <em>Ike</em>, <em>Hero</em>, and <em>Charmed Lives</em>. Educated at Le Rosey in Switzerland and at Magdalen College, Oxford, he served in the Royal Air Force. He took part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and on its fiftieth anniversary was awarded the Order of Merit of the People's Republic of Hungary. He and his wife, Margaret, make their home in Dutchess County, New York.</p>This little book will inevitably be compared with Josiah Bunting's similarly short biography of one of the world's greatest military figures. The marriage of author and subject works well, although Korda (<i>Horse People: Scenes from the Riding Life</i>, etc.) doesn't have much new to say about Lincoln's favorite general. That's not surprising, since everyone now writes about Grant in the shadow of Edmund Wilson, who gave new fame to Grant's memoirs, and William McFeely, who has written the best full biography to date. Even so, Korda freshly characterizes his man without psychologizing an unpromising subject. Grant was, after all, unyieldingly stolid and tight-lipped. While his qualities of directness and taciturnity made him a great general, they didn't yield up a fascinating man or a great president. Korda does about as good a job of bringing Grant to life as possible and handles all the essential set pieces&#x2014;Grant as Mexican War officer, Civil War general, president and author of masterful memoirs on the eve of his death&#x2014;with much skill. He's less perceptive than Bunting about Grant's presidency and occasionally puts unnecessary erudition on display, but on the whole this is a highly readable, accurate study of the man.

Many black residents were poor sharecroppers, but others owned their own farms and the land on which they&#x2019;d founded the county&#x2019;s thriving black churches.</p><p>But then in September of 1912, three young black laborers were accused of raping and murdering a white girl. One man was dragged from a jail cell and lynched on the town square, two teenagers were hung after a one-day trial, and soon bands of white &#x201c;night riders&#x201d; launched a coordinated campaign of arson and terror, driving all 1,098 black citizens out of the county. In the wake of the expulsions, whites harvested the crops and took over the livestock of their former neighbors, and quietly laid claim to &#x201c;abandoned&#x201d; land. The charred ruins of homes and churches disappeared into the weeds, until the people and places of black Forsyth were forgotten.</p><p>National Book Award finalist Patrick Phillips tells Forsyth&#x2019;s tragic story in vivid detail and traces its long history of racial violence all the way back to antebellum Georgia. Recalling his own childhood in the 1970s and &#x2019;80s, Phillips sheds light on the communal crimes of his hometown and the violent means by which locals kept Forsyth &#x201c;all white&#x201d; well into the 1990s.</p><p><em>Blood at the Root</em> is a sweeping American tale that spans the Cherokee removals of the 1830s, the hope and promise of Reconstruction, and the crushing injustice of Forsyth&#x2019;s racial cleansing. With bold storytelling and lyrical prose, Phillips breaks a century-long silence and uncovers a history of racial terrorism that continues to shape America in the twenty-first century.</p> 36 illustrations</p><p>Patrick Phillips is an award-winning poet, translator, and professor.

A woman was shot and killed in her bed during a burglary; she was given a funeral and everyone in the village saw her body burned. Then, three days later, she was back in her house as if she'd never been dead at all. But now she's clairvoyant, and can speak to the dead. That's why the long-dead brother of a Lao general has enlisted her to help his brother uncover his remains, which have been lost at the bottom of a river for many years.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lao national coroner Dr. Siri Paiboun and his wife, Madame Daeng, are sent along to supervise the&nbsp;excavation. It could be a kind of relaxing vacation for them, maybe, except Siri is obsessed with the pretty&nbsp;undead medium's special abilities, and Madame Daeng might be a little jealous. She doesn't trust the woman for some reason&#x2500;is her hunch right? What is the group really digging for at the bottom of this remote river on the Thai border? What war secrets are being covered up?</p><p>Colin Cotterill is the Dilys Award-winning author of nine books in the Dr. Siri Paiboun series: <i>The Coroner's Lunch</i>, <i>Thirty-Three Teeth</i>, <i>Disco for the Departed</i>, <i>Anarchy and Old Dogs</i>, <i>Curse of the Pogo Stick</i>, <i>The Merry Misogynist</i>, <i>Love Songs from a Shallow Grave</i>, and <i>Slash &amp; Burn</i>, and<i> The Woman Who Wouldn't Die</i>. He lives in Chumphon, Thailand, with his wife and six deranged dogs.Madame Keui was flesh and blood, or so they claimed, although nobody could remember touching that rewarmed flesh, nor seeing her bleed; not even when a second bullet passed through her. Even so, to all intents and purposes, she was alive in October of 1978 when this story takes place. They&#x2019;d see her walk along the ridge to collect her groceries or ride her bicycle off into the forest. Some in the village had even heard her speak. She had become Vietnamese, they said. Her Lao was thick with it like too-large lumps of mutton in a broth. She no longer talked directly to the villagers, but strangers from afar came to seek her out. They&#x2019;d go to her house, a fine wooden structure with expensive Chinese furniture; couples and elderly people and families with children. They&#x2019;d sit with her in the living area visible from the quiet dirt street. And when they left, those strangers would seem elated as if a heavy rock had been removed from their souls. But when the villagers stopped them to ask what had happened there, they were silent. It was as if they&#x2019;d forgotten they were<br> ever with her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And perhaps that was why they called her Keui: Madame Used-To-Be. Because whenever they talked about the beautiful old woman it was in the past tense. &#x2018;There used to be a woman who spoke with many voices.&#x2019; &#x2018;There used to be a woman who seemed to get younger as the months passed.&#x2019; &#x2018;There used to be a woman whose<br> house gave off a warm yellow glow even when there was no hurricane lamp oil to be had at the market.&#x2019; And even though they might have passed her on the<br> street that morning, at the evening meal they&#x2019;d still say, &#x2018;There used to be a woman in our village who . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And perhaps that was because two months earlier<br> they&#x2019;d carried her body to the pyre and watched the<br> flames engulf her.<br> <br> Chapter 2<br> <i>The Ninjas From Housing</i><br><br> They lurked in the shadows of the late evening. They&#x2019;d waited out three nights of diamante skies, the streets lit by a billion stars. And, at last, a bank of clouds had<br> rolled in and given them this brief cover. There were five of them, each dressed in navy blue, which was as near as damn it to black. And in the starless navy blue<br> of the Vientiane night they would have been invisible were it not for the battery-powered torches each carried. The beams negated all the preparations of dressing<br> darkly and applying charred cork to their faces. But in the suburbs east of the That Luang monument there was as yet no street lighting and there were any number of potholes in which to step. At eleven p.m. most of the householders were asleep and dreaming of better times. For any times were better than these. Only one or two windows gave off an eerie khaki glow from lamps deep inside and one by one these were extinguished as the men passed. Torch beams as loud as klaxons. Everyone in East That Luang knew something was about to go down and they all knew better than to come to their windows to watch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still a block away from their objective, the leader crouched on one knee and signalled for his men to turn off their lamps. They were immediately plunged<br> into the impenetrable black belly of a giant naga. None of them dared move for fear that the earth all around them might have subsided. Yet, not wanting to be considered<br> cowardly, none of them turned his torch back on. So there they remained. Petrified by the darkness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Give your eyes a few minutes, lads,&#x2019; the leader said in a whisper that seemed to ricochet back and forth through the concrete of the new suburb.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those few minutes crawled past but still the men&#x2019;s eyes had not become accustomed to the dark. Even so, their leader stood. They heard the rattle of the large bunch of keys on his belt. They knew it was time to continue the advance on house number 22B742. Butterflies flapped inside them. This would be a moment from which careers were honed. Medals were given for less.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They kept close in single file behind the leader who seemed to have a nose for darkness. Up ahead, their target emerged from the night. The house glowed brazenly. Candles flickered in the two front windows and . . . could that be the scent of a tune? Yes. Music. Some decadent Western rubbish. The comrades inside were asking for trouble. Begging for it. They&#x2019;d get what they deserved this night. The front yard was visible now in the candle glow and the men could see one another&#x2019;s beady eyes. The leader pointed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;You and you, around the back,&#x2019; he whispered. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t let any escape. We take every last man, woman and child.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two men ran to the side alley with a crouching gait not unlike that of Groucho Marx. But their flank advance was stymied by the fact that the side gate was locked, or blocked, or perhaps it was just a fence that looked like a gate and was too high to&nbsp; climb. They looked back for advice from their leader but he couldn&#x2019;t see them in the shadows. Believing the rearguard to be in place, he led the rest of his team up the garden path to the front porch. He was no lover of these roomridden, occidental-style accommodations. Give him open spaces any day. He reached the door. He had a duplicate key, of course, for number 22B742 but it served no purpose. The door was ajar. He swallowed a gasp and pushed against the heavy teak. The door opened far too obligingly on oiled hinges and if not for a sudden lunge to stop its swing it would have crashed into the hallway wall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flutter of candlelight shimmied from open doorways<br> to the left and right, and up ahead a room he<br> knew from previous visits to be the kitchen was shining<br> brightly. That was the source of the decadent music.<br> And that, he knew, was where the transients would be<br> gathered. They&#x2019;d attempt to flee through the back door<br> and into the trap he had laid. From his side pack he produced a Russian Lubitel 166. Not the most compact piece of equipment but efficient and easy enough to reload. There would be no mistakes this time. He would have them all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the two men sent to the back had retraced their steps and were now attempting to round the building on the east side. This too was a problem because they were met by a dog, an ugly, mean-spirited dog who stood and snarled. Drool dripped from its fangs. The men stopped in their tracks. They had reached the rear kitchen window through which a bright light shone on to their uncomfortable situation.<br> Fortunately the dog was chained and beneath the window was a motorcycle. By climbing on to its seat they were able to both avoid the dog and see inside the house. Just as their heads appeared at the mosquito screen, the leader and his two men burst into the kitchen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Freeze!&#x2019; shouted the leader and there was a flash, then another from his camera. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t anybody . . .&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But there were no transients in the kitchen, just a solitary old man. He was standing naked in a large zinc bathtub. He was up to his shins in bubbly water and<br> held a particularly impressive loofah. Far from being shocked or embarrassed, the old man laughed, turned away from the men, and loofahed his backside with<br> enthusiasm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Search him,&#x2019; shouted the leader. There was no rush to do so. &#x2018;Search all the rooms, the closets, the cupboards, the crawl space beneath the roof.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His head turned in response to some slight movement through the window screen where he saw the faces of the two men who should have been watching<br> the garden.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;What are you doing there?&#x2019; he shouted.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Hosanna Bible</h2><p>Simple retellings of more than 100 stories from the Old and New Testaments.</p><p></p><h2>Victor Six: The Saga of America&#39;s Youngest, Most Decorated Officer in Vietnam</h2><p>Portrays of the trials and tribulations of a soldier who served in Vietnam and returned home to face a country ambiguous about its role in the war</p><p>By the time he was 21, Christian had risen to the rank of Army captain in the American forces fighting in Vietnam and had amassed considerable experience leading a reconnaisance unit whose missions were guerilla warfare, harassment and interdiction. Though something of a rebel, he was also a brilliant leader, admired by the men in the platoon, which had been dubbed "Christian's Butchers." In due course, he was badly wounded and hospitalized, returned to combat and then was seriously burned by napalm. Returning to the U.S., he resumed his status as a warrior, this time fighting for Vietnam veterans' rights to education, job training and, above all, appreciation by their fellow citizens. Writing here with Hoffer ( Midnight Express ), Christian, now a business consultant, makes a strong case for the oft-maligned servicepeople who went to war in Vietnam simply because their government told them to--and his pleas for an understanding of what they have suffered will leave no reader indifferent. Photos. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Written with Hoffer, coauthor of Billy Hayes's story in Midnight Express (LJ 4/15/77), this book is an account of Christian, the "Victor Six" of the title, and his unit during the Vietnam War. Utilizing unorthodox tactics, the unit successfully met the enemy time and again in the jungles of Vietnam and Cambodia. Wounded in action, Christian returned to the war only to be severely burned by napalm. This ended one war for him, and he returned home to wage another. While completing his college education and undergoing 33 operations for his wounds, Christian became an outspoken champion for veterans; in fact, he lost his veterans' affairs job with the Carter administration after a much-publicized speech.

By the author of Deep South. 85,000 first printing.</p><p>Park ranger Anna Pigeon, the fortyish heroine of Barr's popular series, is back, tracking grizzlies through the unforgiving landscape of Glacier National Park as part of a scientific investigation that's outlined with more detail than anyone who's not totally fascinated by these awesome animals will care about. In fact, the description of what actually goes into the lures set to attract the bears so they can be tagged and counted is guaranteed to rumble the strongest stomach--but that's just the back story in this newest Pigeon adventure. When the mutilated body of the stepmother of one of the bear trackers turns up in a remote corner of the park, and it becomes clear that she met death at the hands of a human rather than the claws of a grizzly, Anna goes on the hunt for the killer.<p> Barr's strength is in depicting the natural surroundings in which her heroine finds inspiration, solace, and comfort, and she limns the gorgeous landscape of Glacier with consummate skill. But her plotting leaves much to be desired, and when she finally reveals the killer's identity, motivation, and especially his accomplice, the discriminating reader may be tempted to throw this book at the nearest teddy bear. The trick ending is too much to stomach, unless you're a grizzly who'll eat (almost) anything. Up to that point, however, there's much to appeal to Barr's fans: another beautifully drawn portrait of a piece of America's vanishing wilderness and a few hours in the company of an appealingly cranky heroine whose appreciation of it knows no bounds. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>Award-winning Nevada Barr is the author of eight previous Anna Pigeon mysteries, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Deep South</i>.</p><h2>Tales of the Restoration</h2><p>An exciting series from authors David and Karen Mains, the Gold Medallion, award winning Tales of the Restoration Classic Edition offers readers fast paced action and exciting storytelling that cover Christian themes like restoration, obedience, loving one another, seeking and finding, and more.

From the author of CALL FOR THE DEAD, THE SECRET PILGRIM and THE NIGHT MANAGER.</p><p>John le Carre was born in 1931. After attending the universities of Bern and Oxford, he taught at Eton and spent five years in the British Foreign Service. He is the author of seventeen novels and he lives in Cornwall.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> Cassidy drove contentedly through the evening sunlight, his face as close to the windshield as the safety belt allowed, his foot alternating diffidently between accelerator and brake as he scanned the narrow lane for unseen hazards. Beside him on the passenger seat, carefully folded into a plastic envelope, lay an Ordnance Survey map of central Somerset. An oilbound compass of the newest type was fastened by suction to the walnut dashboard. At a corner of the windshield, accurately adjusted to his field of view, a copy of the Estate Agent's particulars issued under the distinguished title of Messrs. Grimble and Outhwaite of Mount Street W. was clipped to an aluminum stand of his own invention. <i>For the attention of Mr. Aldo Cassidy</i> ran the deferential inscription; for Aldo was his first name. He drove, as always, with the greatest concentration, and now and then he hummed to himself with that furtive sincerity common to the tone-deaf. </p><p> He was traversing a moor. A flimsy ground mist shifted over rhines and willow trees, slipped in little puffs across the glistening hood of his car, but ahead the sky was bright and cloudless and the spring sun made emeralds of the approaching hills. Touching a lever he lowered the electric window and leaned one side of his head into the rush of air. At once rich smells of peat and silage filled his nostrils. Over the reverent purr of the car's engine he caught the sounds of cattle and the cry of a cowhand harmlessly insulting them. </p><p> "It's an idyll," he declared aloud. "It's an absolute idyll." </p><p> Better still it was a safe idyll, for in the whole wide beautiful world Aldo Cassidy was the only person who knew where he was. </p><p> Beyond his conscious hearing, a closed-off chamber of his memory echoed to the awkward chords of an aspiring pianist. Sandra, wife to Aldo, is extending her artistic range. </p><p> "Good news from Bristol," Cassidy said, talking over the music. "They think they can offer us a patch of land. We'll have to level it of course." </p><p> "Good," said Sandra, his wife, and carefully rearranged her hands over the keyboard. </p><p> "It's a quarter of a mile from the largest boys' school and eight hundred yards from the girls'. The city authorities say there's a fair chance that if we do the levelling and donate the changing rooms, they'll put up a foot-bridge on the by-pass." </p><p> She played a ragged chord. </p><p> "Not an ugly one, I hope. Town planning is extremely important, Aldo." </p><p> "I know." </p><p> "Can I come?" </p><p> "Well you <i>have</i> got your clinic," he reminded her with tentative severity. </p><p> Another chord. </p><p> "Yes. Yes, I've got my clinic," Sandra agreed, her voice lilting slightly in counterpoint. "So you'll have to go alone, won't you? Poor Pailthorpe." </p><p> Pailthorpe was her private name for him, he could not remember why. Pailthorpe the Bear, probably; bears were their most popular fauna. </p><p> "I'm sorry," said Cassidy. </p><p> "It's not <i>your</i> fault," said Sandra. "It's the Mayor's, isn't it? After all," she added speculatively, "he <i>runs</i> the town, doesn't he?" </p><p> "Naughty Mayor," said Cassidy. </p><p> "Naughty Mayor," Sandra agreed. </p><p> "Spank him," Cassidy suggested. </p><p> "Spank, spank," gaily said Sandra, wife to Aldo, her face in combat with its shadows. </p><p><br> He was a fair-haired man of thirty-eight and quite handsome in certain lights. Like his car he was groomed with loving elegance. From the left-hand buttonhole to the breast pocket of his faultless suit ran a thin gold chain of obvious usefulness whose purpose was nevertheless undefined. Aesthetically it perfectly answered the subdued pin stripe of the cloth behind it; as a piece of rigging it joined the head of the man to the heart, but there was no telling which end if either held the mastery. In both build and looks he might have served as an architectural prototype for the middle-class Englishman privately educated between the wars; one who had felt the wind of battle but never the fire of it. Heavy at the waist, short in the leg, a squire always in the making, he possessed those doggedly boyish features, at once mature and retarded, which still convey a dying hope that his pleasures may be paid for by his parents. Not that he was effeminate. True, the mouth was well advanced from the rest of the face and quite deeply sculptured under the lower lip. True also that as he drove he was guilty of certain affectations which pointed in the female direction, such as brushing aside his forelock or putting back his head and wrinkling his eyes as though a sudden headache had interfered with brilliant thoughts. But if these mannerisms meant anything at all, then most likely they reflected a pleasing sensitivity towards a world occasionally too shrill for him, an empathy as much parental as childish, rather than any unwelcome tendencies left over from public school. </p><p> Clearly he was no stranger to the expense account. An untaxable affluence was legible in the thickening of the lower waistcoat (for his safety and comfort he had unfastened the top button of his trousers) and in the widths of white cuff which isolated his hands from manual labour; and there was already about his neck and complexion a sleek rich gloss, a tan almost, <i>flamb�</i> rather than sun-given, which only balloon glasses, Bunsen burners, and the fumes of <i>cr�pes suzette</i> can faithfully reproduce. Despite this evidence of physical well-being, or perhaps in contrast to it, the outward Cassidy possessed in some devious way the power, even the authority to disturb. Though he was not in the slightest degree pathetic there was something to him which caught the eye and demanded help. Somehow he managed to convey that the encroachments of the flesh had not yet killed the magic of the spirit. </p><p> As if in recognition of this protective r�le which Cassidy unconsciously imposed on his environment, the interior of the car was provided with many important adaptations designed to spare him the distressing consequences of collision. Not only had the walls and ceiling and doors been generously upholstered with additional layers of quilt; the steering wheel, the child-proof door handles -- already deeply recessed in succulent cavities of felt -- the glove compartment, brake lever, even the discreetly concealed fire extinguisher, each was separately encased in hand-stitched leather and padded with a pleasing flesh-like substance calculated to reduce the most drastic impact to no more than a caress. At the rear window a sun-proof canopy, electrically operated and bordered with small silk balls, hung poised to defend at any time the good man's neck against an overzealous sun or his eyesight against the harmful dazzle of alien headlights. As to the dashboard it was a veritable medicine chest of preventive physic: from blinker lights to ice-alert, from reserve battery to reserve oil supply, from safari petrol tank to auxiliary cooling system its switches anticipated every catastrophe known to nature and the manufacturing industries. Cassidy's was a car that conveyed rather than transported; a womb, one might even have thought, from whose padded, lubricated interior the occupant had yet to make his entry into the harder world. </p><p><br> "How far to Haverdown, do you mind?" </p><p> "Eh?" </p><p> <i>"Haverdown."</i> Should he spell it? Most likely the fellow was illiterate. "Haverdown. The great house. The manor." </p><p> The lolling mouth opened and partially closed, voicelessly mimicking the name; a grimy arm struck towards the hill. "Straight on up over look." </p><p> "And is it far, would you say?" Cassidy enquired loudly, as if addressing the deaf. </p><p> "Won't take you more than five minutes, will it, not in <i>her?"</i> </p><p> "Thanks a million. Good luck to you old son." </p><p> In the mirror the yokel's brown face, frozen into an expression of comic incredulity, watched him out of sight. Well, thought Cassidy, the fellow has seen somet</p></p><h2>Daughter of Earth</h2><p>This gritty autobiographical novel recreates the amazing life story of an American working class woman.

His fiercely loyal wife and Queen, Margaret of Anjou, safeguards her husband&#39;s interests, hoping that her son Edward will one day know the love of his father. Richard Duke of York, Protector of the Realm, extends his influence throughout the kingdom with each month that Henry slumbers. The Earls of Salisbury and Warwick make up a formidable trinity with Richard, and together they seek to break the support of those who would raise their colours in the name of Henry and his Queen. But when the King unexpectedly recovers his senses and returns to London to reclaim his throne, the balance of power is once again thrown into turmoil. The clash of the Houses of Lancaster and York will surely mean a war to tear England apart . . . Following on from Stormbird, Trinity is the second epic instalment in master storyteller Conn Iggulden&#39;s new Wars of the Roses series.

With stunning honesty and a lively, sly humor, Rae Yang records her life from her early years as the daughter of Chinese diplomats in Switzerland, to her girlhood at an elite middle school in Beijing, to her adolescent experience as a Red Guard and later as a laborer on a pig farm in the remote northern wilderness. She tells of her eventual disillusionment with the Maoist revolution, how remorse and despair drove her almost to suicide, and how she struggled to make sense of conflicting events that often blurred the line between victim and victimizer, aristocrat and peasant, communist and counterrevolutionary. Moving gracefully between past and present, dream and reality, the author artfully conveys the vast complexity of life in China as well as the richness, confusion, and magic of her own inner life and struggle.<br><br>Much of the power of the narrative derives from Yang's multi-generational, cross-class perspective. She invokes the myths, legends, folklore, and local customs that surrounded her and brings to life the many people who were instrumental in her life: her nanny, a poor woman who raised her from a baby and whose character is conveyed through the bedtime tales she spins; her father; her beloved grandmother, who died as a result of the political persecution she suffered.<br><br>Spanning the years from 1950 to 1980, Rae Yang's story is evocative, complex, and told with striking candor. It is one of the most immediate and engaging narratives of life in post-1949 China.</p><p>Born in 1950, Rae Yang came of age in a time of tremendous social upheaval in her native China. Her parents, Communist intellectuals who had been in favor with the leadership, were denounced during the so-called anti-Rightist campaigns of the 1950s. During the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s Yang, a Red Guard, traveled throughout the country spreading revolutionary fever--an exciting period, she recalls, that she had much time to reflect on while later working at a collectivized pig farm. (She named the pigs under her charge, she writes: Capitalist, Prince, Natasha, and so on.) Disillusioned by the violence, repression, and hardship all around her, Yang eventually managed to leave China on a student visa for the United States. &#34;Lies, big and small, cannot easily hypnotize me,&#34; she writes, and her memoir paints an honest portrait of a China in suffering."By oscillating between scenes that are bland in their matter-of-fact concreteness and ones that are almost unbelievable in their nightmarish cruelty and complexity, Rae Yang skillfully evokes the bizarre and contradictory 'revolutionary' world in which she grew up in Mao's China. <i>Spider Eaters</i> is a reminder of what a traumatic history the Chinese people have undergone this century and that a country's past&#x2014;even when many would rather forget it&#x2014;always lives irrevocably on within those who experienced it."&#x2014;Orville Schell, author of <i>Mandate of Heaven</i><br><br>"How can we expect anyone to know the United States without understanding the effect the Sixties had on all of us? Similarly, how can we know China without comprehending the impact the Sixties and the Cultural Revolution had on its politics, culture, and people? Rae Yang's <i>Spider Eaters</i> goes far in building that understanding. It is a gripping memoir."&#x2014;Lisa See, author of <i>On Gold Mountain</i></p><h2>The NIV Application Commentary: 2 Corinthians</h2><p>Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from our world to the world of the Bible. But they leave us there, assuming that we can somehow make the return journey one our own. In other words, they focus on the original meaning of the passage but don&#39;t discuss its contemporary applications. The information they offer is valuable -- but the job is only half done! The NIV Application Commentary Series helps us with both halves of the interpretive task. This new and unique series shows readers how to bring an ancient message into modern context.

Now, in her most mesmerizing novel yet, she invites us to a house-party at Buckingham Palace. <br><br>The Prince of Wales has asked four wealthy entrepreneurs and their wives to the palace to discuss a fantastic idea: the construction of a six-thousand-mile railroad that would stretch the full length of Africa. But, alas, the prince&#x2019;s gathering proves disastrous when the mutilated body of a prostitute hired for a late-night frolic (after the wives have retired to bed) turns up among the queen&#x2019;s monogrammed sheets in a palace linen closet.<br><br>With great haste, Thomas Pitt, brilliant mainstay of Special Services, is summoned to resolve the crisis. The Pitts&#x2019; cockney maid, Gracie, is also recruited&#x2013;to pose as a palace servant and listen in on the guests&#x2019; conversations, scan their bedrooms, and scrutinize their troubled faces for clues to hidden rivalries and attachments that could have lead to murder. If Pitt and Gracie fail to find out who brutally murdered the young woman&#x2013;as seems increasingly likely&#x2013;Pitt&#x2019;s career will be over, and the scandal may just cause the monarchy to fall.<br><br>With a cast of wonderful characters, among them the gentle Princess of Wales, and a twisting plot that takes us into the hidden world of the royal family, Anne Perry probes deeply the hearts of men and women ensnared by their own emotions. Never has this distinguished novelist told a story with more truth and passion.</p><p>Anne Perry is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including Seven Dials and Long Spoon Lane, and the William Monk novels, most recently The Shifting Tide and Dark Assassin. She is also the author of the World War I novels No Graves As Yet, Shoulder the Sky, Angels in the Gloom, At Some Disputed Barricade, and We Shall Not Sleep, as well as the holiday novels A Christmas Journey, A Christmas Visitor, A Christmas Guest, A Christmas Secret, and A Christmas Beginning.

Then, before Pitt could say anything further, he corrected himself. &#x201c;One of the linen cupboards in Buckingham Palace. It was a particularly brutal murder.&#x201d;<br><br>The vehicle jerked forward, throwing Pitt back in the seat. &#x201c;A prostitute?&#x201d; he said incredulously.<br><br>Narraway was silent for a moment. The horse&#x2019;s hoofs clattered loudly, the carriage&#x2019;s wheels rattling over the cobbles dangerously close to the pavement edge.<br><br>&#x201c;Surely that&#x2019;s a bad joke!&#x201d; he said at last as they swung around the corner into The Mall and picked up speed again.<br><br>&#x201c;Very bad,&#x201d; Narraway agreed. &#x201c;At least I hope so. But I fear it is perfectly serious. However, if Mr. Cahoon Dunkeld proves to be wasting our time exercising his sense of humor, I shall take great joy in personally putting him in jail&#x2014;preferably one of our less pleasant ones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It has to be a joke,&#x201d; Pitt said, shivering at the thought. &#x201c;There couldn&#x2019;t be a murder at the Palace. How could a prostitute get in there, anyway?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Through the door, exactly as we shall, Pitt,&#x201d; Narraway answered. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be na�ve. And she was probably more welcome than we shall be.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt felt a little stung. &#x201c;Who is Cahoon Dunkeld?&#x201d; he asked, avoiding looking at Narraway. He had a reverence for Queen Victoria, especially now in her advanced age and widowhood, even though he was perfectly well aware of her reputed eccentricities and the fact that she had not always been so popular with her people. She had been in mourning too long, retreating not only from joy but also from duty. And he had gained some personal knowledge a couple of years ago of the extravagance and the self-indulgence of the Prince of Wales, and knew he kept several very expensive mistresses. Pitt had been superintendent of Bow Street then, and the conspiracy around the Prince had cost him his job and very nearly brought down the throne. That was why Pitt was now working for Victor Narraway in Special Branch, learning more about treason, anarchy, and other forms of violence against the State.<br><br>But the thought of a prostitute in the Queen&#x2019;s home was different. It disgusted him, and he had difficulty concealing it, even though he knew Narraway found him plebeian amd faintly amusing for having such idealism.<br><br>&#x201c;Who is Cahoon Dunkeld?&#x201d; he repeated.<br><br>Narraway leaned forward a little. The dappled, early-morning sunlight of The Mall made bright patterns on the road. There was little traffic. It was not a residential area, and such horseback riders as were out would be cantering up and down Rotten Row on the edge of Hyde Park.<br><br>&#x201c;An adventurer of considerable charm when he wishes, and undoubted ability, who is now seeking to become a gentleman in the more recognized social sense,&#x201d; Narraway answered. &#x201c;And apparently a friend of His Royal Highness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is he doing at the Palace at this hour of the morning?&#x201d; Pitt said.<br><br>&#x201c;That is what we are about to find out,&#x201d; Narraway snapped as they came out of The Mall in front of the Palace. The magnificent wrought-iron railings were tipped with gold. Guards were on duty wearing bearskin helmets, their red tunics bright in the sun.<br><br>Pitt looked up at the sweeping fa�ade itself and then at the roof. He saw with a flood of relief that there was no flag flying, indicating that Her Majesty was not in residence. At the same time he was inexplicably disappointed. He was quite aware that Narraway would find it gauche of him, but Pitt would like to have caught another glimpse of Her Majesty Queen Victoria. In spite of all common sense, there was a quickening of his heartbeat. Even inside the hansom cab he sat straighter, lifted his chin a little, and squared his shoulders.<br><br>If Narraway noticed, he did not allow himself even the slightest smile.<br><br>They swung round to the right, heading for the entrance where tradesmen and deliveries would go. They were stopped at the gate. Narraway gave his name, and immediately the guard stepped back and saluted. The cabdriver, startled into respect, urged his horse forward at a newly dignified pace.<br><br>Ten minutes later Pitt and Narraway were being conducted up the wide, elegant stairs by a manservant who had introduced himself as Tyndale. He was of slight build but he moved with suppleness, even some grace, although Pitt judged him to be well into his fifties. He was courteous enough, but quite obviously distressed beyond any ability to maintain his normal composure.<br><br>At any other time Pitt would have been fascinated to think that he was inside Buckingham Palace. Now all he could think of was the enormity of what lay ahead of them. The magnificence of history meant nothing.<br><br>Was this an idiotic practical joke? Tyndale&#x2019;s pallid face and stiff shoulders said not, and for the first time since Narraway had made his extraordinary statement in the hansom, Pitt considered the possibility that it might be true.<br><br>They were at the top of the stairs. Tyndale walked across the landing and knocked on a door a little to the left. It was opened immediately by a man of much greater height than he, with broad shoulders and a dark face of remarkable dynamism. He was severely balding, but this in no way diminished his handsomeness. His gray hair must once have been black because his brows still were. His skin was burned by sun and wind to a deep bronze.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Narraway has arrived, Mr. Dunkeld,&#x201d; Tyndale said quietly.<br><br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Dunkeld replied. &#x201c;Now please leave us, and make sure that we are not interrupted. In fact, see that no staff come up onto this floor at all.&#x201d; He turned to Narraway as if Tyndale was already gone. &#x201c;Narraway?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>Narraway acknowledged it, and introduced Pitt.<br><br>&#x201c;Cahoon Dunkeld.&#x201d; The big man held out his hand and shook Narraway&#x2019;s briefly. He ignored Pitt except for a nod of his head. &#x201c;Come in, close the door.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned and led the way into the charming, highly overfurnished room. Its wide, tall windows overlooked a garden, and beyond them the trees were motionless billows of green in the morning sun.<br><br>Dunkeld remained standing in the middle of the floor. He spoke solely to Narraway. &#x201c;There has been a shocking event. I have never seen anything quite so . . . bestial. How it should happen here, of all places, is beyond my comprehension.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me exactly what has happened, Mr. Dunkeld,&#x201d; Narraway responded. &#x201c;From the beginning.&#x201d;<br><br>Dunkeld winced, as if the memory were painful. &#x201c;From the beginning? I woke early. I . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Deliberately Narraway sat down in one of the large overstuffed chairs covered in wine-colored brocade. He crossed his legs elegantly, if a little rigidly, at the knees. &#x201c;The beginning, Mr. Dunkeld. Who are you, and why are you here at this hour of the morning?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake . . . !&#x201d; Dunkeld burst out. Then controlling himself with obvious difficulty, body stiff, he sat down also and began to explain. He had the air not of having grasped Narraway&#x2019;s reasoning so much as being given no choice but to humor a lesser intelligence. His fingers drummed on the arm of his chair.<br><br>&#x201c;His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, is deeply interested in an engineering project that may be undertaken by my company, and certain of my colleagues,&#x201d; he began again. &#x201c;Four of us are here at his invitation in order to discuss the possibilities&#x2014;the details, if you like. Our wives have accompanied us to give it the appearance of a social occasion. The other three are Julius Sorokine, Simnel Marquand, and Hamilton Quase. We have been here two days already, and the discussions have been excellent.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt remained on his feet, listening and watching Dunkeld&#x2019;s face. His expression was intense, his eyes burning with enthusiasm. His left hand, gripping the chair arm, was white at the knuckles.<br><br>&#x201c;Yesterday evening we celebrated our progress so far,&#x201d; Dunkeld continued. &#x201c;I assume you are a man of the world, and do not need to have every detail drawn for you? The ladies retired early. We sat up considerably longer, and a certain amount of entertainment was provided. The brandy was excellent, the company both relaxing and amusing. We were all in high spirits.&#x201d; Not once did he glance at Pitt as he spoke. He might have been as invisible as a servant.<br><br>&#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Narraway answered expressionlessly.<br><br>&#x201c;We retired between one and two in the morning,&#x201d; Dunkeld went on. &#x201c;I awoke early&#x2014;about six, I imagine. I was in my robe, not yet dressed, when my valet came with a message that he had received over the telephone. It was a matter His Royal Highness had asked to be informed of immediately, so, in spite of the hour, I took it to him. I returned to my room, shaved and dressed, had a cup of tea, and was on my way back to see His Royal Highness further about the matter, but passing the linen cupboard in the passage I saw the door slightly open.&#x201d; His voice was harsh with tension. &#x201c;That in itself, of course, is of no interest, but I became aware of a curious odor, and when I pulled it wider . . . I saw . . . probably the most dreadful thing I have ever seen.&#x201d; He blinked and seemed to need a moment to compose himself again.<br><br>Narraway did not interrupt him, nor move his gaze from Dunkeld&#x2019;s face.<br><br>&#x201c;The naked body of a woman, covered in blood,&#x201d; Dunkeld said hoarsely. &#x201c;There was blood all over the rest of the linen.&#x201d; He gulped air. &#x201c;For a moment, I could not believe it. I thought I must have taken more br...</p><h2>The Dastard (Xanth, No. 24)</h2><p><p>Many malevolent menaces have imperiled the magical land of Xanth in its long and storied history.

In <i>Queen Victoria: Twenty-Four Days That Changed Her Life, </i>Lucy Worsley introduces her as a woman leading a truly extraordinary life in a unique time period. Queen Victoria simultaneously managed to define a socially conservative vision of Victorian womanhood, while also defying its conventions. Beneath her exterior image of traditional daughter, wife, and widow, she was a strong-willed and masterful politician. </p><p>Drawing from the vast collection of Victoria&#x2019;s correspondence and the rich documentation of her life, Worsley recreates twenty-four of the most important days in Victoria's life. Each day gives a glimpse into the identity of this powerful, difficult queen and the contradictions that defined her. <i>Queen Victoria</i> is an intimate introduction to one of Britain&#x2019;s most iconic rulers as a wife and widow, mother and matriarch, and above all, a woman of her time.</p></p><p>LUCY WORSLEY is a historian, author, curator and television presenter.

Born in a small Alabama town, Vestal Goodman was the fourth of six children whose destiny was sealed by their father's prediction that someday VestalAthe name means "purity and chastity"Awould be preaching and singing the gospel message. At 16, Vestal dedicated her life to serving God through her own musical gifts. In her late teens, she met and fell in love with her soon-to-be husband, Howard Goodman, a preacher nine years her senior. Both husband and wife gave their all to God as they pastored churches and sang for congregations across the country, and they, along with their two children, soon became known as the Happy Goodman family. Vestal tells of God's challenges to their faith through a number of tragedies, including the deaths of family and friends and Vestal's own struggle with heart disease and cancer. Goodman portrays her healings from her medical conditions as proof that God can turn tragedy into an opportunity to trust God, and she has shared the healing work of Christ with music stars like Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton and Jerry Lee Lewis, among others. Goodman's fans will appreciate her candid portrait of her life as the white handkerchief-waving, gospel-singing Sister Vestal. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Original Self: Living with Paradox and Originality</h2><p><p></p><blockquote>"I spent many years trying to become conscious, but all that effort led merely to self-consciousness, which in turn generated guilt, anxiety, and ambition. I was told that higher consciousness was a worthy goal and that its opposite, unconsciousness, was the result of laziness and ignorance. Around the age of fifty my ideals and values began to change, so much so that many of them turned upside down and inside out. Now I see great value in laziness, understood as giving up both effort and the attempt to justify my life. I have come to appreciate the teaching I have found in many religions that praises holy ignorance. And I have been discovering how to live with little consciousness<p></p><p>"Emerson once remarked that it is advisable to live without consciousness of the workings of the body, and I wonder if the same recommendation applies to the whole of life. Perhaps in some ways we do have to become conscious, and that may be the proper work of the first half of life. But then all our education and learning experiences may fade, not into oblivion, where they are simply lost, but by a process of absorption into us, so that they become us or we become them."</p><p></p>from Original Self</blockquote><p></p><p>It's easy today to lose the deep, direct, and vivid sense of living with passion and originality. Thomas Moore states in his preface that we are "chronically trying to be someone other than this original self, persuaded that we are not adequate and should fit some norm of health or correctness, we may find a cool distance may gradually separate us from the deep and eternal person, that God-given personality, and we may forget both who we were and who we might be."</p><p>The fifty meditations in this collection offer fresh interpretations of living with originality rather than conformity, presenting multi-dimensional portraits of the creative self and different angles from which to tap one's primal emotions and possibilities. These pages show what it means to live from the burning essence of the heart, with the creativity that comes from allowing the soul to blossom in its own colors and shapes. Simple and beautiful woodcut drawings accompany each meditation, showing the primal yet complex nature of experience and suggesting with great subtlety the themes of paradox and contrariety that characterize the deep self.</p><p>With his usual grace and insight, Moore counters the prevailing assumptions of the day and offers strikingly unorthodox views on at is virtuous and healthy, opening up possibilities for a renewal of the way we live socially and in our private lives.</p></p><p>The original self is the person "who came into this world full of possibility and destined for joyful unveiling and manifestation," according to bestselling author Thomas Moore. "This is the person who comes to life in us briefly as we get married, start a course in school, or try on a new job--before worry and cynicism have set in."<p> In essence, it is our soul that Moore speaks of, and it is his unwavering conviction that our greatest task is to stay true to our original selves. Using a highly approachable format of brief essays (two to four pages), Moore offers his reflections on how to do just that. Each essay leads with a thought, such as, "Life needs a point of entry, a crack in our defenses" or, "Beneath the favorite tale of the moment a deeper story always lies waiting to be told." From there Moore moves into the eloquent depths of his ruminations on the original self--words that are beautiful and provocative yet never heady or bogged down with self-importance. In fact, his writing manages to be simultaneously poetic and pragmatic--the signature of a great thinker and humanitarian. Each essay is illustrated with a woodblock print, offering further meditation on a theme. Moore openly admits that he hopes this book will become a keeper--one that dwells on a household's shelf of lifetime books. No doubt it will Mr. Moore, somewhere between Emerson and Thoreau. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><p>Thomas Moore is the author of the bestselling <em>Care of the Soul</em> and twenty other books on spirituality and depth psychology that have been translated into thirty languages.

Within a year she had appeared on the covers of magazines all over the world. A whirlwind life as a top model jetting from Paris to New York to London and all over the world was followed by a four-year affair with Bryan Ferry and then by 20 years married to Mick Jagger, travelling with the Rolling Stones and appearing on stage and screen. Over the years she has been photographed by all the greats and has consistently presented an impeccably glamorous image. She has also managed to maintain a private life without too much intrusion. Curated by Jerry herself, this book is a celebration of her life so far - a fabulous collection of photographs from her earliest modelling days to the present time, including her appearances on rock album covers, TV, film and stage. Works by Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Andy Warhol, David Bailey, Norman Parkinson, Helmut Newton, Karl Lagerfeld, Rankin - and many others - are featured alongside shots of her glamorous life and intimate snapshots of friends and family, Mick Jagger and their children. Interwoven through it all is Jerry&#39;s candid narrative, charting the highs and lows of her extraordinary life. Jerry Hall: My Life in Pictures documents the truth behind the image of one the world&#39;s most enduring and photographed stars.</p><p>Jerry Hall was born in Gonzales, Texas, the youngest of five girls. Aged 16 she took a trip to France and was discovered sunbathing on a beach in St Tropez by a model scout. Within weeks she had been photographed by Helmut Newton for the cover of French Vogue, within the year she had graced the covers of 40 top fashion magazines, and the rest is history. A close friend of Andy Warhol, muse of Bryan Ferry, then married to Mick Jagger for 20 years, with whom she had four children, Jerry has lived an extraordinary life modelling, appearing on stage and screen and travelling the world. She lives in London with her children.

Living on the run-down but romantic family estate and receiving her education from governesses, she began to write and illustrate stories at the age of ten. After her father&#x2019;s death, she attended art school in London and married a painter, with whom she had two children she supported by trading antiques and classic cars, modeling, breeding poodles, and renovating apartments. A second marriage, to Richard Comyns Carr, who worked in the Foreign Office, took place during World War II. Comyns wrote her first book, <i>Sisters by the River</i> (1947), a series of sketches based on her childhood, while living in the country to escape the Blitz, which is also when she made an initial sketch for <i>The Vet&#x2019;s Daughter</i>. This, however, she put aside to complete <i>Our Spoons Came from Woolworths</i> (1950), about her first marriage, and <i>Who was Changed and Who was Dead</i> (1955). <i>The Vet&#x2019;s Daughter</i> was published in 1959. Among Barbara Comyns&#x2019;s other books are the novels <i>The Skin Chairs</i> (1962) and <i>The Juniper Tree</i> (1985), and <i>Out of the Blue into the Red</i> (1960), a work of nonfiction about Spain, where she lived for eighteen years.<p>&#x201c;Comyns's world is weird and wonderful.

Fletcher Prouty, the former CIA operative known as X,&#x201d; offers a history-shaking perspective on the assassination of president John F. Kennedy. His theories were the basis for Oliver Stone&#x2019;s controversial movie <i>JFK</i>. Prouty believed that Kennedy&#x2019;s death was a coup d&#x2019;�tat, and he backs this belief up with his knowledge of the security arrangements at Dallas and other tidbits that only a CIA insider would know (for example, that every member of Kennedy&#x2019;s cabinet was abroad at the time of Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination). His discussion of the elite power base he believes controlled the U.S. government will scare and enlighten anyone who wants to know who was really behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</p><p><strong>L. Fletcher Prouty</strong> (1917&#x2013;2001), a retired colonel of the U.S. Air Force, served as the chief of special operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Kennedy years. He was directly in charge of the global system designed to provide military support for the clandestine activities of the CIA. He was also the author of <em>The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies</em>.Following Oliver Stone's JFK, Prouty (whom Stone depicted as ``X,'' Jim Garrison's secret informant on the military-industrial complex) offers an update on the assassination. Anyone new to assassination studies will find Prouty's many theses (not much different than those he discussed in The Secret Team, 1973) unsettling at the very least, and it seems unlikely that every single column of smoke Prouty points at has no fire at its base aside from a blaze of paranoia, especially when he is not given to paranoid phraseology. Here, he adds nothing new to the theories set forth by the Stone film, only spells them out. Prouty's point of view comes from his nine-year stint as a chief of special operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, carrying out secret operations against Vietnam and Cuba, among other countries. These ``Black Ops,'' which included infiltrating CIA teams into foreign countries and building up insurgencies, in many ways married the CIA to the military-industrial complex. Prouty outlines how the government has carried out policies meant to swell defense contracts while maintaining low-intensity wars since 1945; tells how, in that year, he watched US equipment stockpiled on Okinawa being shipped to Indochina, where we armed all sides for their upcoming conflicts--all support for his contention that there's an elite power-base behind the US government, which knowingly or unknowingly fulfills its needs. On the assassination, Prouty restates many themes whose familiarity and thinness of detail here in no way lessen their force. But one finds spotty scaffolding that brings into question whole sections of the assassination plot. Conspiracy? Perhaps. Carried out for the reasons Prouty suggests? Maybe. But does he present the facts? No, just theories. The big picture, in large strokes, by a man of unusual courage in going out on limbs. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

An apt symbol of the man who shaped both court and country, whose life "reads like an early history of the United States," as the Wall Street Journal noted, adding: Jean Edward Smith "does an excellent job of recounting the details of Marshall's life without missing the dramatic sweep of the history it encompassed."<br></p><p>It&#39;s taken for granted today that the Supreme Court has final say on how the Constitution is interpreted, but this principle--hotly debated in the republic&#39;s early years -- was established by John Marshall (1755-1835), the fourth Chief Justice. Historian Smith&#39;s definitive biography, detailed and lucid, is a model of scholarly writing for the general public. The author claims our admiration for the justice and sparks affection for the man: warm, gregarious, fond of drink, a Federalist with the common touch, a seasoned political infighter who remained on good terms with his opponents.Jean Edward Smith is professor of political science at the University of Toronto.

It turns out that the Reverend Wynter isn&#x2019;t on holiday at all&#x2013;and that something very sinister has transpired. <br><br>As a blizzard leaves Cottisham treacherously snowbound and the isolated village swirls with unsavory secrets, Dominic and Clarice suddenly find themselves in deadly danger.</p><p>Anne Perry is the bestselling author of No Graves As Yet, Shoulder the Sky, and Angels in the Gloom; three earlier holiday novels: A Christmas Journey, A Christmas Visitor, and A Christmas Guest; and two acclaimed series set in Victorian England.

Visit her website at www.anneperry.net.Clarice Corde leaned back in her seat as the train pulled out of the station in a cloud of steam. Smuts flew and engine roared as they gathered speed on their journey northward. The rain beat against the window; she could barely see the glistening rooftops of London. It was December 14, 1890, ten days until Christmas Eve. She had been married little more than a year, and she was far from used to being a vicar&#x2019;s wife. Neither obedience nor tact came to her except with a considerable effort, but she made that effort for Dominic&#x2019;s sake.<br><br>She glanced sideways at him now and saw him deep in thought. She knew he was concerned about his ability to rise to this opportunity they had been offered so unexpectedly. The elderly Reverend Wynter had taken a richly deserved holiday; therefore his church, in the small village of Cottisham in Oxfordshire, needed someone to stand in for him and care for his flock over Christmas.<br><br>Dominic had seized the chance. He was a widower who had abandoned a self-indulgent life and embraced the ministry somewhat late. Perhaps no one but Clarice saw beyond his startlingly handsome face and charm of manner to the doubts beneath. She loved him the more fiercely because she knew he understood his own weaknesses as well as the power of his dreams.<br><br>He looked up and smiled at her. Once again she was warmed by amazement that he should have chosen her: the awkward sister, the one with the slightly crooked nose that gave her face a wry, individual look, the one with the tactless tongue and the pungent sense of humor, rather than any of the reliable and more conventional beauties eager for his attention.<br><br>This chance to go to Cottisham was the greatest Christmas gift they could have been given. It was an escape from serving under the Reverend Spindlewood in the bleak area of industrial London to which he had been sent as curate.<br><br>How could Clarice reassure him that they expected only patience, and that he should be there to listen and comfort, to assure them of the message of Christmas and peace on earth?<br><br>She reached her hand across and touched his arm, tightening her fingers for a moment. &#x201c;It will be good,&#x201d; she said firmly. &#x201c;And being in the country will be a delight.&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled at her, his dark eyes bright, knowing what she meant to tell him.<br><br>They traveled for nearly two hours, most of it through gently rolling countryside, the fields now bare except for the meadows still green. The woodlands and copses were without leaf, and the higher crowns of the hills were dusted with snow. Here in the heart of England winter could be surprisingly fierce, and no doubt there was far worse weather to come.<br><br>For the most part the villages lay in the hollows, the first sight from the train windows being the steep spires of the churches, then the huddled roofs.<br><br>They reached the station nearest to Cottisham and hired a pony trap to take them the last few miles through winding lanes, up the brow of a long, ridge-backed hill, and down into the sloping valley.<br><br>The village was beautiful, even though it boasted little more than a wide green with a duck pond and houses all around it. Many of the dwellings were thatched, their bare winter gardens neatly tidied. Perhaps half a dozen narrow roads twisted away into the surrounding woods and the fields beyond. The church was Saxon: slate-roofed, with a square tower rising high against the wind-torn clouds.<br><br>The pony trap drew up in front of the rambling stone vicarage. The driver unloaded their cases onto the gravel and quickly drove away.<br><br>Clarice looked at the closed door, then at the fine Georgian windows. It was a beautiful house, but it seemed oddly blind, as if it were oblivious to their arrival, and they would knock on the oak door in vain. This was to be their home, and Dominic&#x2019;s challenge and opportunity would be to preach and to minister without the supervision&#x2014;or constant meddling&#x2014;of the Reverend Spindlewood. Clarice knew she must behave with enthusiasm now, whatever doubt or loneliness she felt. That was what faith was about. Anyone can be cheerful when she is confident and the sun is shining.<br><br>She looked at Dominic once, then marched up to the front door and banged briskly with the lion&#x2019;s head knocker.<br><br>There was total silence from inside.<br><br>&#x201c;Stay here with the boxes,&#x201d; Dominic said quietly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go to the nearest house. They must have left the keys with someone.&#x201d;<br><br>But before he could go more than a dozen steps a stout woman, her hair piled atop her head in an untidy knot, came bustling along the road. She struggled to hold a shawl around her shoulders against the wind.<br><br>&#x201c;All right! All right! I&#x2019;m coming,&#x201d; she called out. &#x201c;No hurry! It ain&#x2019;t snowin&#x2019; yet. You must be the Reverend Corde. An&#x2019; Mrs. Corde, I take it?&#x201d; She stopped in front of them and looked Clarice up and down dubiously, her blunt face skeptical. &#x201c;I s&#x2019;pose you know how to care for a house, an&#x2019; all?&#x201d; she said in a tone close to accusation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Mrs. Wellbeloved. I look after the vicar, but I can&#x2019;t do no more for you than a bit o&#x2019; the heavy work, &#x2019;cos I&#x2019;ve got family coming for Christmas, an&#x2019; I need me holiday, too. In&#x2019;t good for a body to work all the days o&#x2019; the year, an&#x2019; it in&#x2019;t right to expect it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course we don&#x2019;t expect it,&#x201d; Clarice agreed, although she had in fact expected exactly that. &#x201c;If you show me where to find everything and assist with the laundry, I&#x2019;m sure that will be most satisfactory.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Wellbeloved looked more or less mollified. She produced a large key from her pocket, unlocked the door, and led the way in. &#x201c;Just leave them boxes. Old Will and young Tom&#x2019;ll bring &#x2019;em on up for yer.&#x201d;<br><br>Clarice followed her, pleasantly surprised by the warmth of the house, even though the vicar had been gone for a couple of days. It smelled of lavender, beeswax, and the faint, earthy perfume of chrysanthemums. Everything looked clean: the wooden floor, the hall table, the doors leading off to left and right, the stairs going up toward a wide landing. There was a large vase of branches and leaves of gold and bronze on the floor. For all her lack of grace, Mrs. Wellbeloved seemed to be an excellent housekeeper.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be liking it here,&#x201d; she said more to Dominic than to Clarice. It sounded something of an order. &#x201c;Folks know how to behave decent. Come to church reg&#x2019;lar and give to the poor. Won&#x2019;t be nothing for you to do but your duty. Just keep it right for the vicar to come back to. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s left you a list of them as needs visiting, but if he hasn&#x2019;t, I can tell you.&#x201d; She opened the sitting room door to show them a grace- ful room with a wide fireplace and bay window, and then closed the door again. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be takin&#x2019; all services reg&#x2019;lar,&#x201d; she went on, walking quickly toward the kitchen. &#x201c;An&#x2019; you won&#x2019;t be wantin&#x2019; the sexton, but if you do, he&#x2019;s first on the right on the Glebe Road. Grave digger&#x2019;s two down beyond.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you, Mrs. Wellbeloved.&#x201d; Dominic avoided meeting Clarice&#x2019;s eyes and answered with as straight a face as he could manage.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be in reg&#x2019;lar for the heavy stuff, &#x2019;ceptin&#x2019; Christmas Day, an&#x2019; Boxin&#x2019; Day, o&#x2019; course,&#x201d; Mrs. Wellbeloved continued. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have enough coal an&#x2019; coke an&#x2019; likely enough kindlin&#x2019;, but if you haven&#x2019;t you can go walk in the woods an&#x2019; pick up plenty. Works best of all, if you dry it proper first. An&#x2019; you&#x2019;ll walk Harry, too. I can&#x2019;t be doin&#x2019; that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Harry?&#x201d; Dominic asked, puzzled.<br><br>&#x201c;Harry.&#x201d; She looked at him witheringly. &#x201c;The dog! Didn&#x2019;t the vicar tell you about Harry? Retriever, he is. Good as gold, if you treat him right. An&#x2019; Etta. But you don&#x2019;t need to do nothin&#x2019; for her, &#x2019;cept scraps and stuff, an&#x2019; milk. She&#x2019;ll fend for herself.&#x201d;<br><br>Clarice made a quick guess. &#x201c;Etta&#x2019;s a cat?&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Wellbeloved looked appeased for their ignorance. &#x201c;Right good little mouser, she is. Plain as you like, but clever. Capture &#x2019;em all in the end.&#x201d; She said it with satisfaction, as if she identified with the animal and were in some oblique way describing herself as well.<br><br>Clarice could not help being amused. &#x201c;I am sure we shall get along excellently. Thank you for showing us in. We shall have a cup of tea, and then unpack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s everything you&#x2019;ll need for today,&#x201d; Mrs. Wellbeloved said, nodding. &#x201c;Game pie in the pantry, an&#x2019; plenty o&#x2019; vegetables, such as there is this time o&#x2019; year. You&#x2019;ll need onions. Vicar loved &#x2019;em. Hot onion soup best thing in the world for a cold, he said. Smells worse &#x2019;n whiskey, but at least you&#x2019;re sober.&#x201d; She gave Dominic a hard, level look.<br><br>He returned it unflinchingly, then slowly smiled.<br><br>Mrs. Wellbeloved grunted. A pink blush spread up her face, and she turned away. &#x201c;Handsome is as handsome does,&#x201d; she muttered under her breath.<br><br>Clarice thanked her again and saw her to the door. She was ready to be alone in her new temporary home and take stock of things. But first she wanted a cup of tea. It had been a long journey, and it was close to the shortest day in the year. Storm clouds were looming up over the trees, and the light was fading.<br><br>The house was everything she could have hoped. It had charm and individuality. The furniture was all well used, but also well cared for. Nothing really matched, as if each piece had been gathered as opportunity arose, and yet nothing appeared to be out of place.

Also gathered here are selections from James's other formative works, including <i>The Meaning of Truth, Psychology, The Will to Believe, and Talks to Teachers on Psychology</i>.</p><p><i>"I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities."</i> <p> When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on "natural religion," he defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which "the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions." It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.</p>"<b>The Varieties of Religious Experience</b> is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential [one] written on religion in the twentieth century," said Walter Houston Clark in <b>Psychology Today</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in June 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the pluralistic views of psychologist-turned-philosopher William James, it posits that individual religious experiences, rather than the tenets of organized religions, form the backbone of religious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;James's discussion of conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter--as well as his observations on the religious experiences of such diverse thinkers as Voltaire, Whitman, Emerson, Luther, Tolstoy, and others--all support his thesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;"James's characteristic humor, his ability to put down the pretentious and to be unpretentious, and his willingness to take some risks in his choices of ancedotal data or provocative theories are all apparent in the book," noted Professor Martin E. Marty.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reader will come away with more reasons to raise new questions than to feel that old ones have been resolved."</p><h2>Endangered Species</h2><p>Park ranger and amateur sleuth Anna Pigeon investigates the deadly crash of the local drug-enforcement plane on an isolated Georgia island in the Cumberland Island National Seashore and uncovers shady dealings, possible sabotage, and murder. 50,000 first printing. $50,000 ad/promo.

Chaplin's widow allowed David Robinson to examine their personal archives in Switzerland, and he makes good use of this access in his meticulous descriptions of the movies that created the legend, including <i>City Lights</i> and <i>Modern Times.</i> Robinson is less interested in Chaplin's tumultuous personal life, skating rather lightly over the lawsuits and scandals that plagued his later years in the United States. No matter: Chaplin lovers will find their understanding of his films enhanced; those unfamiliar with his artistry will learn why an actor-director whose greatest work was done before 1940 remains a key figure in the history of motion pictures.LJ's reviewer asserted that Robinson offers "unprecedented insights into Chaplin's methods in this thorough biography" (LJ 9/1/85), although he added that the book should be read in conjunction with Robinson's other Chaplin titles.

Their firsthand accounts let us experience up close the spectacular scenery; the details of camping out in both friendly and hostile Indian territory; the constant danger from natural disasters or sudden attack; the hardworking, often maverick men who were employed on the wagon trains; the pleasures and entertainments at the southern end of the journey.<br>The book makes clear how in the early years trade started and stopped at the whim of the Spanish, and how the trail finally grew and prospered, bringing the settlement of new towns and the creation of new wealth along the route. We also learn how the rapid spread of the railroads across the country inexorably replaced the long caravans of mule- and ox-drawn wagons, and the way of life they represented.<br>With his comprehensive knowledge and his exceptional storytelling skills, David Dary has given us a vivid re-creation of an important time and place in American history.</p><p>"Commendably lucid . . . a wonderful job of resurrecting the past � For anyone wishing to visit this remarkable region up close and personal."-JoAnn Levy, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"The story of the Western frontier is to the American imagination what Hector and Achilles were to the Greeks . . .

It's doubtful their "chuck" much resembled the lively fare offered by restaurateur Tom Perini in <i>Texas Cowboy Cooking</i>, a collection of 75 recipes from the Perini Ranch Steakhouse. That said, the dishes, which include the likes of Black Bean and Roasted Corn Salad, Oven Roasted Beef Brisket, and Jessica's Favorite Green Chili Hominy, are just the thing when the call of meat and Tex-Mex seasoning can't be denied. Illustrated with color photos throughout, the book provides a big-food journey, noting en route the Texas lore that gives it context. Most readers will probably pass on the Calf Fries, a local delicacy the author hardly admits are made from beef testicles. But when Perini talks steak--offering useful cut information and such tempting dishes as a Spicy Beef Tenderloin with Roasted Garlic-Horseradish Cream, Round Steak Rolls, and Laredo Broil, a superior version of marinated flank steak--you'll want to pay attention. Other standouts include an exemplary Texas Chili, Winter Squash Soup, Grilled Sourdough with Texas Onion Butter (a recipe for the bread is included), Carrots with Bourbon Sauce, and the fancier Celebration Venison with Ginger and Wine. Desserts aren't neglected, and simple sweets like Grandmother's Pound Cake, Jane's Sweet Potato-Pecan Pie, and Bread Pudding with Whisky Sauce should put a happy end to whatever appetite is left after a massive Perini spread. With a short but interesting section on cowboy life and informative sidebars (such as Aging Beef), the book provides easily made, easily enjoyed food for millennial buckeroos everywhere. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>Buffalo Gap, Texas.

Beric, who is a boy-chief of a British tribe, takes a prominent part in the insurrection under Boadicea; and after the defeat of that heroic queen (in A.D. 62) he continues the struggle in the fen-country. Ultimately Beric is defeated and carried captive to Rome, where he is trained in the exercise of arms in a school of gladiators. Such is the skill which he there acquires that he succeeds in saving a Christian maid by slaying a lion in the arena, and is rewarded by being made librarian in the palace, and the personal protector of Nero. Finally he escapes from this irksome service, organizes a band of outlaws in Calabria, defies the power of Rome, and at length returns to Britain, where becomes a wise ruler of his own people.--- 12 illustrations</p><p>G.A.

Widely recognized as America&#39;s leading literary critic, he teaches at Yale and NYU.Bloom's great distinction and power as a literary critic, and a best-selling one at that, is the union of his extraordinary erudition and his profound love for literature. A gifted reader, teacher, and writer, he has celebrated literature's munificence in such influential books as <i>The Western Canon</i> (1994) and <i>How to Read and Why</i> (2000), and now conducts a magnificent inquiry into that elusive quality called genius. Bloom strictly profiles "geniuses of language"--poets, dramatists, novelists, philosophers, and religious writers--and, except for a core group that includes Shakespeare, Cervantes, Dante, Milton, and Tolstoy, has selected his 100 (all deceased, including the most contemporary: Octavio Paz, Ralph Ellison, Iris Murdoch) not because they're the top geniuses, but because their quests were in some measure cosmic, their language transcendent, and their lives intriguing. Literature is a spiritual calling for Bloom and his geniuses, so he has organized this bountiful volume according to the Kabbalah's 10 divine attributes or emanations, the <i>Sefirot</i>, which chart "the process of creation." This makes for some wonderfully fresh and provocative juxtapositions, and for an elevating concentration on how each writer extends the path toward wisdom. Personal heroes such as Dr. Samuel Johnson and Ralph Waldo Emerson receive particularly incisive readings, as do Victor Hugo, Isaac Babel, Virginia Woolf, Wallace Stevens--well, one could go on. Bloom's mission in this stupendous yet intimate compendium of succinct yet sophisticated essays is "to activate the genius of appreciation" in his readers for one of humanity's finest callings, and that he does with ardor, art, wit, and deep knowledge. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

D.G. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Southern Storm: Sherman&#39;s March to the Sea</h2><p><p>Award-winning Civil War historian Noah Andre Trudeau has written a gripping, definitive new account that will stand as the last word on General William Tecumseh Sherman's epic march&#x2014;a targeted strategy aimed to break not only the Confederate army but an entire society as well. With Lincoln's hard-fought reelection victory in hand, Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the Union forces, allowed Sherman to lead the largest and riskiest operation of the war. In rich detail, Trudeau explains why General Sherman's name is still anathema below the Mason-Dixon Line, especially in Georgia, where he is remembered as "the one who marched to the sea with death and devastation in his wake."</p><p>Sherman's swath of destruction spanned more than sixty miles in width and virtually cut the South in two, badly disabling the flow of supplies to the Confederate army. He led more than 60,000 Union troops to blaze a path from Atlanta to Savannah, ordering his men to burn crops, kill livestock, and decimate everything that fed the Rebel war machine. Grant and Sherman's gamble worked, and the march managed to crush a critical part of the Confederacy and increase the pressure on General Lee, who was already under siege in Virginia.</p><p>Told through the intimate and engrossing diaries and letters of Sherman's soldiers and the civilians who suffered in their path, <em>Southern Storm</em> paints a vivid picture of an event that would forever change the course of America.</p></p><p><p>Noah Andre Trudeau is the author of <em>Gettysburg</em>. He has won the Civil War Round Table of New York's Fletcher Pratt Award and the Jerry Coffey Memorial Prize. A former executive producer at National Public Radio, he lives in Washington, D.C. </p>Starred Review. Trudeau, a prize-winning Civil War historian (<i>Gettysburg</i>), addresses William T. Sherman's march to the sea in the autumn of 1864. Sherman's inclusion of civilian and commercial property on the list of military objectives was not a harbinger of total war, says Trudeau. Rather, its purpose was to demonstrate to the Confederacy that there was no place in the South safe from Union troops. The actual levels of destruction and pillage were limited even by Civil War standards, Trudeau says; they only seemed shocking to Georgians previously spared a home invasion on a grand scale. Confederate resistance was limited as well. Trudeau praises Sherman's generalship, always better at operational than tactical levels. He presents the inner dynamics of one of the finest armies the U.S. has ever fielded: veteran troops from Massachusetts to Minnesota, under proven officers, consistently able to make the difficult seem routine. And Trudeau acknowledges the often-overlooked contributions of the slaves who provided their liberators invaluable information and labor. The march to the sea was in many ways the day of jubilo, and in Trudeau it has found its Xenophon. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos, 36 maps<i>.

In this urgent new book, three astute observers argue that we have lost control of our southern border, so that the vast majority of our immigrants are now illegal Mexicans. Poor, uneducated, and unskilled, these newcomers add much less to the national wealth than they cost the taxpayers for their health care, the education of their children, and (too often) their incarceration. <i>The Immigration Solution</i> proposes a policy that admits skilled and educated people on the basis of what they can do for the country, not what the country can do for them.</p><p>Heather Mac Donald is author of <i>The Burden of Bad Ideas</i> and <i>Are Cops Racist?</i> and lives in New York City. Victor Davis Hanson's most recent book is <i>A War Like No Other</i>; his syndicated column appears in newspapers throughout the country. He lives in Palo Alto, California. Steven Malanga's most recent book is <i>The New New Left</i>.

This book is a critically important read for our elected officials and the citizens they should be representing. (Lou Dobbs)<br><br><i>The Immigration Solultion</i> is not just another book about the catastrophe caused by millions of illegal aliens flooding our country; it is a call to arms combined with an outline for a sensible immigration policy. If every member of Congress would read this book, we might be able to begin the process of securing our borders and reducing the number of illegal immigrants within them. (Thomas Tancredo, United States Congressman from Colorado)<br><br>In this book, the writers from <i>City Journal</i> again show why that magazine is so indispensible. Having helped change conventional wisdom on the urban problems of crime and welfare, they have now taken a hard look at an issue even more suffused with sentimentality and cliche. <i>The Immigration Solution</i> is essential reading for anyone seeking to develop an informed opinion on this vital national issue. (Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies)<br><br>The divise debate over immigration is going to continue for some time to come. MacDonald, Malanga, and Hanson lucidly present their concerns over the current direction of immigration policy and offer more than a few suggestions for change. Even if you disagree with their preferred policy changes, their suggestions are serious, provocative, and worthy of careful thought &#x2013; and, regardless of your ideological background, you might actually find yourself nodding more than a few times as your read through the book. (Dr. George Borjas, Robert W. Scrivner Professor of Economics and Social Policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and the author)<br><br><i>The Immigration Solution</i> demolishes open-borders myths and provides a clear, sane path toward an immigration plan that benefits America and adheres to the rule of law.

His story forms the basis of the most significant true crime book in memory, for Frankos gives details here of such events as the 1957 shooting of Albert Anastasia, the Lord High Executioner of Murder, Incorporated, and the 1972 robbery of the Hotel Pierre in Manhattan, which may have netted as much as $25 million. Most intriguing are his revelations about the murder of labor leader Jimmy Hoffa in 1975. Frankos claims to have been on the hit team and to have dismembered the corpse with a chainsaw and a meat cleaver. Hoffa's body parts in plastic bags were purportedly buried in cement at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. A man whose only regret is that he became "a rat," Frankos is at his most vivid in recalling the horror of prison life. Hoffman ( Unholy Matrimony ) and the late Headley, a Las Vegas private eye, have told the story effectively, but why Frankos is not credited as one of the authors is a puzzlement. Photos not seen by PW. 125,000 first printing; $125,000 ad/promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Donald "Tony the Greek" Frankos says he killed Jimmy Hoffa and knows where the body is buried. Now in prison, he casually confesses to scores of murders, although only a few are detailed here. His story is told as a first-person narrative, a style that tends to encourage the reader's empathy. Frankos does not deserve it, but his tale is nonetheless chilling and revealing. Hoffman and private investigator Headley say they verified Frankos's allegations, the most startling being that he bribed prison officials to grant him illegal "furloughs" and used the time to carry out "hits." Essential reading for organized crime buffs, and there may be a wider appeal with the recent release of the movie Hoffa. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 9/1/92.<br><i>- Gregor A.

Drawn from real-life statistics about racially inspired attacks on our country&#x2019;s reservations, this tale is forceful but never preachy, thanks in large part to Erdrich&#x2019;s understated but glorious prose and her apparent belief in the redemptive power of storytelling. --<i>Sara Nelson</i><p>National Book Award Winner</p><p>One Sunday in the spring of 1988, a woman living on a reservation in North Dakota is attacked. The details of the crime are slow to surface as Geraldine Coutts is traumatized and reluctant to relive or reveal what happened, either to the police or to her husband, Bazil, and thirteen-year-old son, Joe. In one day, Joe's life is irrevocably transformed. He tries to heal his mother, but she will not leave her bed and slips into an abyss of solitude. Increasingly alone, Joe finds himself thrust prematurely into an adult world for which he is ill prepared.</p><p>While his father, who is a tribal judge, endeavors to wrest justice from a situation that defies his efforts, Joe becomes frustrated with the official investigation and sets out with his trusted friends, Cappy, Zack, and Angus, to get some answers of his own.

And this is only the beginning.</p><p>Written with undeniable urgency, and illuminating the harsh realities of contemporary life in a community where Ojibwe and white live uneasily together, <em>The Round House</em> is a brilliant and entertaining novel, a masterpiece of literary fiction. Louise Erdrich embraces tragedy, the comic, a spirit world very much present in the lives of her all-too-human characters, and a tale of injustice that is, unfortunately, an authentic reflection of what happens in our own world today.</p></p><h2>1519 All-Natural, All-Amazing Gardening Secrets: Expert Tips for gardens and Yards of All sizes</h2><p>Did you know that pepper will repel squirrels and coffee grounds leaf-eating insects?

Paden, Chair, Department of Religion, University of Vermont<br><br></b>For as long as human beings have had language, they have had myths. Mythology is our earliest form of literary expression and the foundation of all history and morality. Now, in <i>Parallel Myths, </i>classical scholar J. F. Bierlein gathers the key myths from all of the world's major traditions and reveals their common themes, images, and meanings.<br><br><i>Parallel Myths</i>&nbsp;introduces us to the star players in the world's great myths&#x2014;not only the twelve Olympians of Greek mythology, but the stern Norse Pantheon, the mysterious gods of India, the Egyptian Ennead, and the powerful deities of Native Americans, the Chinese, and the various cultures of Africa and Oceania. Juxtaposing the most potent stories and symbols from each tradition, Bierlein explores the parallels in such key topics as creation myths, flood myths, tales of love, morality myths, underworld myths, and visions of the Apocalypse. Drawing on the work of Joseph Campbell, Mircea Eliade, Carl Jung, Karl Jaspers, Claude L�vi-Strauss, and others, Bierlein also contemplates what myths mean, how to identify and interpret the parallels in myths, and how mythology has influenced twentieth-century psychology, philosophy, anthropology, and literary studies.<br><br><b>&#x201c;A first-class introduction to mythology . . .

Roberts, M.D., is Director of The Women&#x2019;s Cardiac Center at the Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. She is also an Associate Clinical Professor of Medicine at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University. She spent two years at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) where she was involved in the first clinical trial that demonstrated a beneficial effect of lowering cholesterol on the incidence of heart disease.The Truth About Statins INTRODUCTION<p></p> <br>Statin medicines to lower cholesterol were approved in the United States in 1987. Over the last few decades, I have been prescribing statins for my patients when it was indicated, and, initially, these medicines seemed safe and reasonably well tolerated. But the more I have learned about statins, both from the experiences of my own patients and in the medical literature, the more concerned I have become. As more and more people have taken statins, there have been more and more reports of serious and sometimes fatal side effects. Now that statin use has accelerated, I feel compelled to share the results of my research into this powerful class of medicines. By educating readers about the facts behind the supposed miracle cure, I hope to encourage you to speak freely with your medical practitioners and to make informed decisions about preserving your heart&#x2019;s health.<br> <br>Every day, in my practice as director of the Women&#x2019;s Cardiac Center at the Miriam Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, I see patients who cannot tolerate statins. Some of them complain about muscle aches and weakness, or tendonitis, while others struggle with frightening memory loss and difficulty concentrating. These side effects may not be as rare as we&#x2019;ve been led to believe.<br> <br>In fact, my husband developed severe muscle pain from every statin on the market. He was started on statins after a trip we took to Italy in 1995, when he more or less overdosed on prosciutto di Parma. He came home to a total cholesterol count of over 300. His primary care doctor prescribed various statins over the years, but his muscle aches interfered with his ability to run and lift weights, which he loves to do. Finally, he went on the seafood-vegetarian Mediterranean diet that I describe in this book. His cholesterol levels, from this diet and a nonstatin medicine that blocks the absorption of cholesterol, are now satisfactory.<br> <br>Some people can take statins and not develop side effects. But how necessary are statins in the first place? Do they really help prevent strokes and heart attacks? Nowadays, doctors are advised to knock down their patients&#x2019; cholesterol to very low levels with high doses of statins. But cholesterol, far from being the villain it&#x2019;s said to be, is a vital part of every cell in our bodies. This waxy fat, produced primarily by the liver, is absolutely crucial for the normal functioning of muscles, nerve cells, and the brain&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s also the building block that our bodies use to manufacture many hormones, including the reproductive hormones estrogen and testosterone. How will our muscles, brain cells, and nerves react if they are chronically starved of a chemical that is so necessary for their proper functioning?<br> <br>These and other important questions about statins need unbiased, scientifically valid answers. Why do women seem to derive less benefit from statins than men do? Why do women report more side effects from statins? What questions should you ask your doctor if he/she wants you to take a statin? How solid is the science that is used to justify treating people with statins? What is now at stake for the pharmaceutical industry (Big Pharma), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the medical profession, and, most important, the people who take statins?<br> <br>In researching these issues, I pored over the studies that were used to justify treating people with statins. I spoke to my own patients who&#x2019;d experienced side effects from the drugs, and to other people who&#x2019;d heard of my interest in statin side effects and contacted me. I educated myself on the interactions among Big Pharma, the FDA, and the medical profession.<br> <br>The FDA is responsible for reviewing and approving any new prescription drugs that pharmaceutical companies want to sell to the American public. When this approval process is complete, the government agency spells out the specific reasons (indications) why doctors may prescribe the drug. The drug label must describe the approved reasons to use the medicine, along with the conditions under which the medicine should not be used (contraindications). For example, taking statins is contraindicated in pregnancy because these drugs can cause defects in a developing fetus.<br> <br>The FDA not only certifies all new prescription drugs but also must approve any new use of existing drugs. However, once the FDA approves a drug, physicians can prescribe it for anything they choose. Unapproved indications are called off-label uses of a drug. Doctors can prescribe, but pharmaceutical companies cannot advertise, off-label uses of a drug.<br> <br>Statins are approved to treat high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (so-called bad cholesterol). In most cases, they are prescribed for people with high levels of cholesterol or with built-up fatty deposits called plaque in their arteries: those who either have or are at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Several scientific studies found that statins lowered the risk of cardiac events in people with established atherosclerosis. (Events is the neutral term we doctors use for really bad outcomes like heart attacks and death.) However, the benefit was modest and was less in women than in men. Furthermore, despite statin therapy, people with ASCVD still had a high residual risk&#x2014;that is, they had an increased risk of heart attack and stroke even when their LDL cholesterol was brought to very low levels. There were also studies that showed benefits of statin therapy in people without cardiovascular disease but with elevated levels of LDL cholesterol. This benefit was found only in men, however, not women.<br> <br><br> <br>In February 2010, based on a study called the JUPITER trial, the FDA expanded the indication for statin use. It now included healthy men ages fifty and older and healthy women ages sixty and older&#x2014;even those with normal levels of LDL cholesterol&#x2014;if they have evidence of inflammation in the body (indicated by elevated levels of a substance called high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, or hsCRP, in the bloodstream), plus one other risk factor for developing heart disease, such as smoking or high blood pressure. JUPITER is an acronym for Justification for the Use of Statin in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin. This new indication for rosuvastatin (Crestor), the statin used in the trial, could add six and a half million healthy people&#x2014;who exhibit no evidence of ASCVD and have normal cholesterol levels&#x2014;to the number taking statins.<br> <br>The trial recruited close to eighteen thousand people who were free of diagnosed heart disease. Half were treated with rosuvastatin and half received a placebo, or inactive &#x201c;dummy&#x201d; pill. The people enrolled in the study were then followed for the occurrence of cardiovascular events such as nonfatal heart attacks, stroke, or death due to cardiac disease, or the need for coronary artery bypass surgery or other procedures to improve blood flow to the heart.<br> <br>The trial was scheduled to last five years but was stopped prematurely &#x201c;for benefit&#x201d; after an average follow-up of just under two years. This means that the investigators felt that the benefit of the statin in lowering the risk of cardiovascular events was sufficient to end the trial before it was scheduled to end. So based on the results of this study, the FDA approved wider use of rosuvastatin.<br> <br>The JUPITER trial was paid for by AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company that makes Crestor. The principle investigator, Dr. Paul Ridker, developed the blood test that measures hsCRP, and he receives royalties from its use. Both AstraZeneca and Dr. Ridker stand to make a fortune as this new indication for statin use is implemented.<br> <br>But are the results of this study all they are cracked up to be? Might the findings have been different if the JUPITER trial lasted five years, as originally specified? Was the FDA correct in approving this new indication for rosuvastatin? Were there differences in the results for women compared to men? The answers to these questions may shock you and make you question your physician if he or she wants to put you on a statin.<br> <br>In exposing the shoddy science that underlies many of the &#x201c;guidelines&#x201d; that doctors are told they must follow in treating their patients, and in exposing the rampant conflicts of interest among the FDA, Big Pharma, medical scientists, medical centers, and professional medical organizations, I risk being declared a pariah in the medical community.<br> <br>But this story must be told. If you or someone you love takes a statin, please read this book. It might just save your life.</p><h2>Sunstone Book Two</h2><p>It was a simple arrangement. two friends would partake in BDSM sessions together. <br>they had all they needed, the will, the toys and the safe word.

Beginning with the history of autism research, Bargiela shows that studies don't focus enough on the differences between men's and women's brains and skills, such as women's greater talent for 'social mimicry,' and therefore miss the ways autism manifests in women. Bargiela ensures that the medical information is understandable, and when potentially confusing terms arise, quick and concise footnotes are provided. She includes interviews with three autistic women, in which she asked each the same four questions about her life experiences. The responses are revealing; one woman says her assumption that her romantic partners are truthful makes her vulnerable to those who want to take advantage of her. Standing's art is subtle, enhancing the information being shared without distracting from the subject matter. The artwork is reminiscent of art deco, with distinct illustrations and a calming color palette. <b>This informative work has insights for those familiar with or new to autism studies, and readers will feel the interviews add an important perspective.</b> Author: Publishers Weekly<br><br>A fantastic, easy-to-digest book for anyone hoping to understand how we can create a safer, more accommodating environment for women on the spectrum.

The child watches the construction of the ark and the arrival of its passengers. Once they are on board and the rain falls, she untangles the crowded beasts so that they can all sleep peacefully. When the storm ends, Grandpa Noah releases her pet dove to search for land. After the creatures disembark, she helps him plant a seed to start life anew. This familiar story serves as a vehicle for Brett's watercolor-and-gouache panoramas of animals, birds, and insects from all corners of the Earth. Even the dodo appears. Each spread features a large scene surrounded by a papyrus border. Smaller pictures that relate to the central image are presented in animal-shaped frames to the left and right. Close-up views of insects appear near the corner of some pages and the dove also has a spot in many illustrations. Such details add to the book's interest for older children, who can find something new to explore during repeat readings. Brett's fans will recognize her artistic style, and where her work is popular, this book is a "must purchase." Other librarians may want to assess demand for Noah stories versus the number of titles in the collection, including Jerry Pinkney's Noah's Ark (North-South, 2002).

[It] deserves a spot on the microbus dashboard as a hell of a cautionary tale about finding paradise and smoking it away."<p><b>In Search of Captain Zero: A Surfer's Road Trip Beyond the End of the Road</b> is a Booksense 76 Top Ten selection for September/October.</p></p><p>In 1966, Allan Weisbecker "made a Manhattan run from the landlocked suburbs" to take in a siren-song movie called <i>The Endless Summer</i>, a documentary that depicted the carefree life of two beach bums who roamed the world in quest of the perfect wave. Weisbecker was hooked, and he became a hardcore wave rider, a fixture on the Long Island surf scene. With a friend, Christopher, he also undertook illegal ways to finance his passion, transporting drugs from exotic countries, a business only briefly interrupted when Christopher went off to Vietnam. There he took fire and came home scarred; something in him changed, and one day he simply vanished.<p> Weisbecker's book, a sort of gonzo detective story blended with travelogue and peppered with hang-10 jargon, does many things, all of them very well indeed. It offers up a vision of innocent times brought to ruin by war and drugs; it recounts his search for his lost friend, whose life had gone from bad to worse far away from home; and it affords a look inside the strange culture of surfing, whose masters "understood, in a visceral and soulful and inexpressible way, the machinations of the sea, and, by subtle inference, the universe at large."</p><p> Full of regret and exhilaration, Weisbecker's memoir is a fine chronicle of a dream gone sour and a friendship redeemed. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Allan C.

David is writing a book about polar bears, dragons, a mysterious fire star, and a transdimensional race from another universe. He's shocked to realize that his fictional tale is actually coming true. He discovers that a powerful dragon is lying dormant and petrified in a mountain. The Fain, an ancient race that revered dragons, intended to colonize Earth eons ago but something disrupted space and closed the line between the worlds, leaving some survivors behind. They have possessed Gwilanna, Liz's powerful and malevolent relative who is determined to call down dragons when the fire star aligns with Earth and the portal to Fain's world opens. If Gawain, the dormant dragon, awakens and dragons arrive and are allowed to breathe fire, they will cause widespread panic and catastrophic environmental damage. The multiple story lines and frequent but cryptic references to events from previous books make this novel a bit confusing for those unfamiliar with the earlier titles. Despite this, the story, with its involving and thought-provoking plot full of clever little dragons, mystical polar bears, and spiritual and ecological aspects, will appeal to many fantasy lovers.&#x2014;<i>Sharon Rawlins, NJ Library for the Blind and Handicapped, Trenton</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This task would be impossible if a player had to actually think about every other hand in his range, but by understanding theoretical sound poker, he can quickly design balanced ranges using the proper bet-sizing while playing. <p>Applications of No-Limit Hold em teaches theoretical sound poker, and thus the ability to create the bet-sizings and ranges which will beat the better players. The theory in this book is not designed to be complex or abstract, but rather it s intended to be applied immediately producing better overall results. </p><p>Many confusing concepts such as overbetting, balancing multiple bet-sizing ranges, donk betting, and check-raising as the preflop raiser are crucial to a player s strategy despite few players implementing them or talking about them. And after reading this book, you should be able to not only conceptually understand these ideas, but also know how to begin incorporating them into your game, and thereby successfully compete against tough opponents.</p></p><p>Matthew Janda has had an interest in card games his entire life, and began playing poker with friends in high school before playing online cash games in college.

He s never been one to discuss what line is best with a specific hand, but rather uses computer programs to display what action he thinks is best with each hand in his entire range. </p><p>Matthew is applying for medical school in 2013 and hopes to be a physician one day.

Where did mortal man go to join the immortal Gods? Was the immense and complex structure at Giza an Egyptian Pharaoh's portal to immortality? Or a pulsating beacon built by extraterrestrials for landing on Earth?</p><p>In this second volume of his trailblazing series <em>The Earth Chronicles</em>, Zecharia Sitchin unveils secrets of the pyramids and hidden clues from ancient times to reveal a grand forgery on which established Egyptology is founded, and takes the reader to the Spaceport and Landing Place of the Anunnaki gods&#x2014;"Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came."</p></p><p>ARCHAEOLOGY / HISTORY <br> <br>Special large-format edition, lavishly illustrated with maps, diagrams, and photographs. Mythic memory has long held that somewhere on Earth there is a place where we can transcend death and join the gods. In <em>The Stairway to Heaven</em>, Zecharia Sitchin deepens his fascinating explorations into Earth history by looking at this longing for a return to the divine. <br> <br>Combining the enigma of the Pyramids with legends of human attempts to ascend like gods to Heaven in search of immortality, he delves into the lives of the pharaohs of Egypt, who taught how to travel the Route of the Gods to the "eternal afterlife"; the Sumerian king Gilgamesh, who journeyed to distant lands in his quest to "scale heaven" and ward off his mortal fate; Alexander the Great, who believed he was actually the son of a god; and Ponce de Leon, who explored Florida in search of the legendary Fountain of Youth. Finally, he leads us along the gaze of the Sphinx, the "Sacred Guide," for remarkable insight into the archetypal search for eternal life. <br> <br>&#x201c;Well researched and persuasive ...

This is the most complete Hawaii field underwater guide.</p><p>This comprehensive guide to Hawaii's marine vertebrate animals is based on my bestselling book <i>Hawaii's Fishes, a Guide for Snorkelers and Divers</i>. Although <i>Hawaii's Fishes </i>remains in print and continues to satisfy the basic needs of fish watchers in the Islands, I have long wanted to create a larger, more complete reference for the serious underwater naturalist. There is so much more to say! Almost daily I get questions from readers who are seeing species not included in the original book, or who want information on marine mammals, or strange fish behaviors they have observed.<br><br><br><br>To satisfy these advanced snorkelers and divers--and those who want to be--I have added&nbsp;over a hundred rare and unusual fish species to the original book&nbsp;(for a total of 386--far more than any other popular guide), plus hundreds of extra photos showing all kinds of color variations and interesting behaviors, fascinating first-hand accounts of encounters with marine ani�mals, new chapters on Hawai`i's whales, dolphins, seals, sea turtles and sea snakes, and a wealth of information on how all these animals eat, live, and reproduce.<i>The Ultimate Guide to Hawaiian Reef Fishes, Sea Turtles, Dolphins, Whales, and Seals</i> features more pictures, more stories, and more species than any other softcover field guide. Clear underwater photos and scientifically up-to-date descriptions make it easy and fun to identify 386 Hawaiian reef and shore fishes. The ten whale, dolphin, and turtle species seen most often in Hawai`i are included too. Indispensible for snorkelers, divers, teachers, students, and anyone else interested in the sea, this is the ultimate identification book for Hawaiian marine vertebrate animals.<br>But there's more. It is also a gold mine of behavioral information, legends, trivia, and fun facts. Have you ever wondered why spinner dolphins spin? Or how manta rays mate? (see pages 373 and 235) What does it feel like to be stung by a lionfish? (see page 250) Or attacked by a shark! (see page 267) Do you know the smartest fish on the reef? Or why eels tie themselves in knots? (see pages 114 and 196)<br><br>Crammed with stories, picture galleries, sidebars, and 965 full-color photographs, this book takes the concept of a fish identification guide to a whole new level.

The goal? To become Olympians. <br><br>They faced seemingly insurmountable obstacles. The children were Japanese-American and were malnourished and barefoot. They had no pool; they trained in the filthy irrigation ditches that snaked down from the mountains into the sugarcane fields. Their future was in those same fields, working alongside their parents in virtual slavery, known not by their names but by numbered tags that hung around their necks. Their teacher, Soichi Sakamoto, was an ordinary man whose swimming ability didn't extend much beyond treading water. <br><br>In spite of everything, including the virulent anti-Japanese sentiment of the late 1930s, in their first year the children outraced Olympic athletes twice their size; in their second year, they were national and international champs, shattering American and world records and making headlines from L.A. to Nazi Germany. In their third year, they'd be declared the greatest swimmers in the world. But they'd also face their greatest obstacle: the dawning of a world war and the cancellation of the Games. Still, on the battlefield, they'd become the 20th century's most celebrated heroes, and in 1948, they'd have one last chance for Olympic glory. <br><br><i>They were the Three-Year Swim Club.

Filled with raw and emotional descriptions of what it's like to come face-to-face with death, this is the harrowing and uplifting true story of a small group of men who risked everything to save the lives of the Iraqi people and who followed the credence, "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends."<br> As the coauthor of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>American Sniper</i>, Scott McEwen has teamed up with Mattos to help share an unforgettable tale of an American warrior turned humanitarian forced to fight his way into and out of a Hell on Earth created by ISIS.</p><p>EPHRAIM MATTOS is the East Asia Operations Manager for White Mountain Research and is the Founder and CEO of <i>The Fireside Journal</i>.

We <br><br>know it when we see it&#x2014;but what is &#x201c;it&#x201d;? This book will <br><br>not only help you answer that question, but also to really be a <br><br>&#x201c;class act&#x201d; in every area of your life. When you do this&#x2014;and it <br><br>isn&#x2019;t easy&#x2014;you will literally make yourself unforgettable. <br><br>(By the way, just as class is easy to recognize, the absence of <br><br>class is also easy to detect in a man or a woman. That&#x2019;s not something <br><br>you want people to see in you!) <br><br>We&#x2019;ll have much more to say about what class is and why it&#x2019;s <br><br>important in the chapters that follow. You&#x2019;ll have a chance to <br><br>evolve your own definition of class&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll gain practical, <br><br>powerful tools for making yourself unforgettable to everyone you <br><br>meet. Whether it&#x2019;s in business or in any other area of life, nothing <br><br>is more valuable than that. You may not realize the full importance <br><br>of class right now, but when you reach the last page of this <br><br>book, you most definitely will. <br><br>We&#x2019;ll begin by looking at the often unclear meaning of class, <br><br>as well as the <i>very clear </i>effect it can have in both business and <br><br>personal interactions. We&#x2019;ll see how class was really the deciding <br><br>factor at a critical moment in American history, and we&#x2019;ll explore <br><br>how you can make the lessons of that moment work for you.<br><br>In subsequent chapters, we&#x2019;ll explore essential elements that <br><br>compose class in the truest sense of the word. Lastly, in the book&#x2019;s <br><br>final chapter, we&#x2019;ll look at how class expresses itself through <br><br>achievement in the material world&#x2014;for you and also for those <br><br>around you. This ability to create success for others is one of the <br><br>most admirable qualities of class. Like a great athlete, a class person <br><br>always plays the game at a high level and makes better players <br><br>of his or her teammates as well. <br><br>To begin our exploration of class and what it can do, let&#x2019;s look <br><br>at a case in point. There has never been a clearer example of <br><br>class in action than history&#x2019;s first presidential debate. The debate <br><br>took place on September 26, 1960. The participants were John F. <br><br>Kennedy, then a senator from Massachusetts, and Vice President <br><br>Richard M. Nixon. <br><br>Over the years, whole books have been written about this <br><br>event, but it&#x2019;s rarely been discussed from the perspective of class <br><br>in the way that we&#x2019;ll be using the word. Yet class was a huge factor <br><br>in the debate. It made the difference in who won and who lost, <br><br>and in that sense it changed the course of history. <br><br>John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were both in excellent <br><br>form at the time of their televised encounter. Each of them had <br><br>good reason to feel optimistic about the election. Their r�sum�s <br><br>were very different, but were impressive in their different ways. <br><br>Each candidate in 1960 had been nominated on the first ballot <br><br>at his party&#x2019;s national convention. Kennedy, whose nomination <br><br>had come first, had won impressive victories over the more experienced <br><br>Senator Hubert Humphrey in the primaries. Kennedy&#x2019;s <br><br>wins in West Virginia and Wisconsin had made an important <br><br>point about his chances for gaining the presidency, since there had <br><br>been some doubt about whether a Roman Catholic could actually <br><br>win an election outside a predominantly Catholic state such as <br><br>Massachusetts. <br><br>Kennedy&#x2019;s religion had given rise to uncertainty within his <br><br>party, but the Democrats more or less forgot those worries <br><br>after West Virginia and Wisconsin. Then, immediately after his <br><br>nomination, Kennedy made a bold and politically practical move <br><br>in his selection of a running mate. His choice of Texas senator <br><br>Lyndon Johnson may have surprised Kennedy&#x2019;s core supporters <br><br>in the Northeast, but now the Democrats had a powerful national <br><br>ticket. Johnson, who was the Senate majority leader, was a supremely <br><br>experienced politician who knew Washington inside and <br><br>out. He was definitely a fighter, and usually he was a winner. <br><br>Perhaps the only drawback to Johnson&#x2019;s selection as the vicepresidential <br><br>nominee was that he and Kennedy could hardly stand <br><br>each other! But Kennedy put aside his emotions to make an effective <br><br>practical decision. Was that a &#x201c;classy&#x201d; move? We&#x2019;ll come back <br><br>to that question later in this chapter. <br><br>Two weeks after Kennedy&#x2019;s convention, Richard Nixon became <br><br>the Republican nominee. In light of what the future held for him <br><br>when the Watergate scandal broke, it may be difficult to grasp <br><br>how popular Nixon was at the time of his nomination. In those <br><br>years America was preoccupied with the nuclear threat from the <br><br>Soviet Union. Nixon had won huge acclaim when he forcefully <br><br>argued with the Russian premier Nikita Khrushchev at a tradeshow <br><br>exhibit. He had also faced down a large anti-American mob <br><br>during a visit to Venezuela. Nixon seemed to offer security and <br><br>competence at a frightening time in American history. True, he&#x2019;d <br><br>already had a few embarrassing moments. But he&#x2019;d always come <br><br>out whole and on top. And it seemed as if he would again. He was <br><br>definitely the favorite to win the general election. <br><br>The actual positions presented by Kennedy and Nixon were <br><br>similar in some respects and very different in others. Both spoke <br><br>of America&#x2019;s greatness in more or less conventional terms. But <br><br>Kennedy challenged people&#x2019;s complacency while somehow still <br><br>sounding positive. In many of his speeches he referred to a &#x201c;missile <br><br>gap&#x201d;&#x2014;a supposed advantage the Russians possessed in the <br><br>number of intercontinental weapons. No such gap existed, but, as <br><br>with his selection of Lyndon Johnson, Kennedy seemed willing to <br><br>sacrifice certain things to gain his objectives. <br><br>In light of the Republican Party&#x2019;s generally hard line on <br><br>defense issues, it may be difficult to imagine Richard Nixon as <br><br>a dove. But compared to Kennedy, that&#x2019;s how he seemed in the <br><br>1960 election. Not long before, President Eisenhower&#x2014;who had <br><br>been the supreme Allied commander in the war against Nazi <br><br>Germany&#x2014;had warned against the growth of a &#x201c;military industrial <br><br>complex&#x201d; that was threatening to dominate American life. <br><br>Eisenhower&#x2019;s speech on this topic was worthy of the most ardent <br><br>dove, and Kennedy may actually have agreed with most of it. But <br><br>instead, he cast himself as the defender of America&#x2019;s freedom <br><br>against the Soviet military threat. <br><br>As the incumbent vice president, Nixon&#x2019;s campaign speeches <br><br>always referred to a secure present and a brighter future, but <br><br>he spoke of this in the context of Republican principles such as <br><br>free enterprise and decreased government spending. Besides the <br><br>overall message of pro-Americanism, Kennedy and Nixon shared <br><br>wariness of the Soviet threat and agreed on other foreign-policy <br><br>issues, although Kennedy put more emphasis on the need to <br><br>strengthen the military. The similarity of the two candidates&#x2019; <br><br>stated beliefs forced the campaigns to seek out ways to distinguish <br><br>one from the other. <br><br>The election turned into a debate about experience. Both candidates <br><br>had come to Congress in the same year, 1946, but Nixon <br><br>tried to strengthen his qualifications by playing up his foreignpolicy <br><br>credentials as vice president. The experience issue seemed <br><br>to be a weak spot in Kennedy&#x2019;s campaign, and before the first <br><br>debate Nixon seemed to be gaining strength. This was crucial <br><br>because at the time the number of Democrats was far larger than <br><br>the number of Republicans nationwide. The race for the White <br><br>House was so tight that any small advantage could pay enormous <br><br>dividends. <br><br>But just as Nixon was finding his strength, several media <br><br>events took place that had a strong bearing on the outcome of the <br><br>election. <br><br>Nixon&#x2019;s focus on his experience in foreign and domestic policy <br>was damaged by his own boss. In the fall of 1960, President <br><br>Eisenhower was holding a press conference, an activity he had <br><br>never enjoyed. He was in a hurry to get it over with. Then a correspondent <br><br>asked what major decisions Vice President Nixon <br><br>had taken part in making. Eisenhower responded, &#x201c;If you give <br><br>me a week, I might think of one.&#x201d; The president was not really <br><br>trying to slight Nixon. He was trying to make a joke about his <br><br>own weariness and lack of focus. But the remark was a godsend <br><br>to Kennedy. It gave him a chance to undercut the whole issue of <br><br>Nixon&#x2019;s superior experience. Kennedy said, &#x201c;Yes, Mr. Nixon is <br><br>experienced&#x2014;but his experience is in the policies of retreat, defeat, <br><br>and weakness.&#x201d; <br><br>Some other problems started to crop up for Mr. Nixon as well. <br><br>After the Republican National Convention, he had promised to <br><br>campaign in all fifty states, but a knee infection sidelined him <br><br>for two weeks. Then against the advice of his inner circle, he returned <br><br>to the campaign in less than perfect health. And now the <br><br>tired candidate had to turn his attention to the first-ever televised <br><br>presidential debate. Nixon had been a champion scholastic debater <br><br>and welcomed the opportunity to speak with his opponent on national <br><br>TV, but as the evening played out, the subtleties of media <br><br>politics lined up against the vice president. <br><br>Kennedy devoted a tremendous amount of time preparing <br><br>for this event. The recent success of his televised answers about <br><br>religion proved that the medium had immense potential for his <br><br>success. In addition, a strong showing against the highly favored <br><br>Nixon would establish credibility on the issues and further boost <br><br>public confidence in his leadership ability. The vice president also <br><br>came prepared, but the outcome of the debate would not be decided <br><br>by substance. <br><br>Nixon also ran into bad luck on other media fronts. Kennedy <br><br>scored well with blacks when he came to the aid of Martin <br><br>Luther King Jr. after an arrest in Atlanta. The vice president <br><br>was caught in a conflict of interest and had to remain silent on <br><br>the well-publicized event. Kennedy used the press coverage to <br><br>fortify his compassionate, charismatic image. Late in the race, <br><br>Eisenhower stepped up his support for Nixon. This action was <br><br>balked at by the Democrats and possibly made the vice president <br><br>look incapable of winning the election on his own. The perceived <br><br>weakness was eventually echoed in the press. Combined with <br><br>Nixon&#x2019;s poor showing in the first debate, the Eisenhower gaffe, <br><br>and previous triumphs by Kennedy in the media, small pressrelated <br><br>miscalculation such as these took their toll on the Republican <br><br>nominee. <br><br>JFK was able to put Nixon on the defensive with his unexpected <br><br>grasp of the facts, but Nixon held his own in responding <br><br>to the Kennedy criticisms. The major story of the debate became <br><br>the visual appeal of the attractive Kennedy versus the sickly look <br><br>of the worn-down Nixon. Several factors contributed to Nixon&#x2019;s <br><br>poor image. His health problems leading up to the debate had <br><br>resulted in severe weight loss. A freshly painted backdrop on the <br><br>set had dried in a light shade of gray that blended with the color <br><br>of his suit. During cutaways, the cameras caught Nixon wiping <br><br>perspiration from his forehead. He looked cornered and rattled. <br><br>Meanwhile Kennedy looked great in front of the camera. <br><br>It&#x2019;s often been pointed out that people who heard the debate <br><br>on radio thought that Richard Nixon had won, while the millions <br><br>who watched on TV considered John Kennedy the clear winner. <br><br>There&#x2019;s a simple reason for this. Nixon had an excellent presentation, <br><br>but Kennedy had&#x2014;or seemed to have&#x2014;an overwhelming <br><br><i>class </i>advantage. <br><br>What do we mean by class advantage? It doesn&#x2019;t mean that <br><br>Kennedy was wealthier than Nixon, although that was certainly <br><br>the case. What it <i>does </i>mean is the first important point to understand <br><br>about class. John Kennedy&#x2019;s class advantage came in that he <br><br>seemed <i>cool, calm, </i>and in <i>control. </i>Nixon may have had the content, <br><br>but Kennedy had the class. Actually, nothing said that night was <br><br>particularly significant in terms of public policy or world affairs. <br><br>There were no zingers or sound bites, and the issues that were <br><br>discussed seem totally irrelevant in today&#x2019;s world. But what have <br><br>endured are images of a relaxed and confident-looking John F. <br><br>Kennedy&#x2014;clearly the class act, despite that Richard Nixon was <br><br>much more experienced in government and much better known. <br><br>How did this happen? Amid all that has been written about the <br><br>first presidential debate, three points stand out. We&#x2019;ll be returning <br><br>to these points in various forms throughout the book, so as <br><br>you listen to them now, give some thought to how they may also <br><br>be present in your life and your career. You may never run for <br><br>president, but you will surely be facing some of the same decisions <br><br>Kennedy and Nixon made some fifty years ago. On the surface, <br><br>those decisions may have seemed to be about technicalities or <br><br>procedures, but they were really about something else. They were <br><br>about class&#x2014;or the perception of class&#x2014;and about how to most <br><br>effectively communicate that impression. <br><br>First, the participants in the debate were there for very different <br><br>reasons. For Kennedy, the debate was a positive choice. As a <br><br>relative unknown, he had everything to gain and little to lose. For <br><br>Nixon, however, it was a <i>constraint. </i>Worst of all, he imposed the <br><br>constraint upon himself, against the counsel of those around him. <br><br>Nixon&#x2019;s advisers urged him not to debate Kennedy, but Nixon felt <br><br>compelled to do so. He felt he had something to prove, perhaps <br><br>to himself more than to anyone else. So his actions were based on <br><br>insecurity rather than strength. <br><br>This is an extremely interesting dynamic&#x2014;one that can affect <br><br>any decision-maker, regardless of the external circumstances. The <br><br>more powerful people become, the more constrained they may <br><br>feel to prove that they actually deserve their power. They need <br><br>constant reassurance and support, which often manifests itself in <br><br>a crew of yes-men so they can head off any self-doubt. <br><br>Class never expresses itself unwillingly. Class is always a positive, <br><br>or even a joyful, choice. Even if your actions are objectively <br><br>class, the positive effect is canceled if the motivation is negative. <br><br>And make no mistake: negative motivation always reveals itself, <br><br>sometimes in unexpected and embarrassing ways. <br><br>There is an essential link between class and communication. <br><br>Class acts are people who can clearly communicate who they are <br><br>and what their vision is. You don&#x2019;t have to be the smartest person <br><br>in the room to be the leader.

Emboldened to fight the injustices of King Louis XVI, Sophie aims to prove that an educated populace can govern itself--but one of her students, fruit-seller Louise Audu, is hungrier for bread and vengeance than learning. When the Bastille falls and Louise leads a women&#x2019;s march to Versailles, the monarchy is forced to bend, but not without a fight. The king&#x2019;s pious sister Princess Elisabeth takes a stand to defend her brother, spirit her family to safety, and restore the old order, even at the risk of her head.</p><p>But when fanatics use the newspapers to twist the revolution&#x2019;s ideals into a new tyranny, even the women who toppled the monarchy are threatened by the guillotine. Putting her faith in the pen, brilliant political wife Manon Roland tries to write a way out of France&#x2019;s blood-soaked Reign of Terror while pike-bearing Pauline Leon and steely Charlotte Corday embrace violence as the only way to save the nation.

Fany&#x2019;s work has been featured in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Gourmet</i>, <i>Fine Cooking</i>, <i>Daily Candy</i>, <i>NY Daily News</i>, <i>Time Out</i> Magazine, and <i>New York Magazine</i>. She splits her time between her native Mexico and New York City.Introduction<br>&nbsp;<br>Sweetness in Mexico is found all around&#x2014;in the intimacy of the home, at birthday parties, at patriotic holidays, during religious celebrations, and even at death. It&#x2019;s visible in the <i>capirotadas</i> (bread puddings) decorated with toasted peanuts, raisins, and <i>colaciones</i> (colorful hard candies) for Easter; in the chocolate and sugar skulls elegantly adorned with the names of mortals that don&#x2019;t scare anyone; and in the fragrant aromas of cooked guava and cinnamon for the <i>ponche navide�o</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>The ubiquity of sweets may be true for many cultures, but Mexico&#x2019;s variety is something to be noted and celebrated. There are sonnets, melodies, paintings, and poems written about the subject; there are festivals and fairs; there are handmade sweets and breads made in the shapes of worms, pigs, corn, bows, ears, and shells. They are colorful and playful and embedded in our culture. It&#x2019;s a geography made up of <i>alegr�as</i> (crunchy amaranth candies with nuts and seeds), <i>cocadas</i> (coconut candies), and <i>palanquetas</i> (brittles).<br>&nbsp;<br>Mexico is renowned for sweet yeast breads that adorn the air with scents of cinnamon, anise, sugar, fruit, and honey; ice cream pushcarts that brighten the plazas and parks with watermelon, mango, and avocado flavors; and beautiful shops filled with confections that look like precious stones and taste like heaven (if it had a flavor)&#x2014;if you haven&#x2019;t tried the bright green candied limes filled with sweetened coconut, the crumbly pecan marzipans wrapped in brilliant purple and orange papier-m�ch�, or the lusciously sweet goat&#x2019;s milk caramel hidden inside a round wooden box waiting to be opened like an engagement ring, then you haven&#x2019;t lived.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mexico is a country that is privileged in the geographical sense. There are mountains, deserts, forests, coasts, and temperate rural areas. These provide an enormously diverse cuisine intimately linked and defined by the climate and products that are produced in each of them.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are many candies, desserts, breads, and beverages that are associated with a certain region. The north of Mexico is characterized by candies made from milk, particularly goat&#x2019;s milk, and pecans; the roads leading to the coast have a wide array of coconut and tamarind candies; and the center of Mexico is known for its crystallized fruits, such as pumpkin, <i>chirimoyas</i> (custard apples), prickly pear, figs, and pineapple. <br>&nbsp;<br>Even more distinct are the <i>pastes</i>, derived from the term &#x201c;Cornish pastry&#x201d; that the British brought in 1824 to Real del Monte in Hidalgo; sweet sticky <i>cajeta</i> sold in wooden boxes or jars from Celaya; burnt milk ice cream from the markets and stands in Oaxaca; <i>dulces de array�n</i>, a delicious soft candy made from this tart and fragrant fruit from Jalisco; <i>rompope</i> (similar to eggnog) from the convents in Puebla; the anise-scented bread from Pomuch, Campeche; and <i>chamuco</i>, a beverage made from fermented red plums, sweetened with <i>piloncillo</i> from Puebla.<br>&nbsp;<br>The distinction between candies or confections and desserts is difficult to describe in Mexican cuisine. The word <i>dulce</i> literally means &#x201c;sweet,&#x201d; and it is used both descriptively and as a general term for candies or confections. <i>Dulces</i> are often served at the end of a meal as what many would consider dessert. However, sweets in Mexico are enjoyed at all times of the day.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have always had a special affinity for sweets. Growing up in Mexico City, my favorite place to visit was a store downtown called Dulcer�a de Celaya. It is a family-owned store that has been around since 1874. Even after visiting countless times, I am transported to an era that has only existed in my imagination. The windows, ceilings, tile floor, wooden showcases, glass jars, and lamps allow me to escape the incredibly noisy and busy city right outside. The showcases are filled with delicacies, and the hardest thing to do is not buy the whole store! Brittle <i>turr�n</i> made from almonds and chocolate cut into triangles, covered with a thin rice wafer; square goat&#x2019;s milk caramels with pine nuts carefully placed to resemble a flower; and giant crumbly meringues were almost an obligation.<br>&nbsp;<br>Mexican sweets are a highlight of my childhood memories. I used to select the candies and fruit to fill my sister&#x2019;s pi�ata, which we carefully crafted each year. I remember strolling downtown with my aunt Cucus on Sundays while deliciously sweet and tart tamarind juice dripped down my cheeks from the melted <i>nieve</i> (sorbet). A friend of my father&#x2019;s, Dr. Abdon, would visit from Puebla and bring delicacies prepared by the nuns&#x2014;beautiful cookies that resembled the sun, with a creamy center made from pumpkin seeds, and <i>borrachitos</i>, vibrant red gummies filled with a drunken juice of sorts, were always part of the selection. I anticipated his visits with much enthusiasm and discovered my love affair with Mexican sweets at a very young age. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Dulces through Time</i><br>&nbsp;<br>A book about Mexican sweets is truly an encounter with the country&#x2019;s fascinating history that covers five distinct periods. The rich tradition of sweets is one of the fortunate results of the <i>mestizaje</i>, or cultural blend. <br>&nbsp;<br>Pre-Hispanics utilized maguey plants, mesquite, and insect honeys (such as ants, bees, and wasps) to sweeten things and turned out pumpkin seed brittles, amaranth candies, and beverages made from cactus and cacao. The presence of the Arabs through their ingredients and exquisite artistic sensibility impregnated Spain and was adored by Mexico; they influenced the marzipans, <i>bu�uelos</i>, brittles, <i>conservas</i>, and fruit <i>pastes</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>The conquest by the Spanish of Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, began in 1521, and they brought with them more than just weapons. They arrived with cinnamon, wheat, cows, nuts, and sugar cane. The thousand or so nuns who arrived in Mexico gave life to an endless world of candy making. They supported themselves by making and selling confections and adapted their recipes to embrace tropical fruits, vanilla, corn, cacao, and new sugars. The importance of the religious convents as producers of sweets was fundamental in the New Spain.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Spaniards&#x2019; cuisine and culture was deeply influenced by eight centuries of Arab occupancy, and this was apparent in their use of preserves, tamarind, dates, spices, and overly sweet preparations that helped preserve food in the warm climate. Their arrival undoubtedly enriched our cuisine, and it is fair to say, in my opinion, that the combination of the imports from Europe and the indigenous ingredients of this land composes what we refer to as traditional Mexican cuisine today.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sugar cane is perhaps the most influential ingredient that the Spaniards brought to the culture of sweets. Its introduction in the New Spain was only three years after the fall of Tenochtitlan in 1524. It is believed that Spanish conquistador Hern�n Cort�s ordered the first <i>trapiche</i> (a rustic sugar mill commonly fueled by water or animal strength).<br>&nbsp;<br>In the first decades of the colony, candy was produced in four places: in the <i>trapiches</i> and <i>ingenios</i> (industrialized sugar mills) by artisans using the sugar mainly to make preserves and crystallized fruit; in the convents by the nuns; and by some home cooks and producers who sold their merchandise on a small scale. <br>&nbsp;<br>In the sixteenth century, Sebasti�n Elcano arrived in the Philippines. This expansion of the Spanish throne opened new routes of commerce between two faraway lands that had not been in contact previously. As with Arab sweets, there is a parallel in flavors between these two lands that has remained apparent ever since.<br>&nbsp;<br>Independence from the Spaniards occurred in 1810. At that time, the influence of French cuisine enriched Mexico&#x2019;s sweet culture with its napoleons, cakes, and ice creams. The French brought new techniques and styles of sweets, with an emphasis on those that were very rich, buttery, and creamy. Layered cakes, rich ice creams, and the way to enjoy sweets&#x2014;moving from cloistered parlors to caf�s and plazas&#x2014;were just some of the francophone influences. The populist administration of Porfirio D�az played a very important role in this shift, and the consumption of sweets became a more popular affair rather than an elitist one.<br>&nbsp;<br>The inherited culture of the Revolution, a century later, allowed for the continuity of techniques that are deeply rooted in our culture, both popular and regional. Many of the desserts, breads, confections, and beverages have remained the same but introductions of new flavors can always be found, particularly in the enormous diversity of candies made or finished with spicy and/or very sour flavors. Fancy restaurants and shops continue to borrow techniques from the Europeans, while always putting Mexican flavors at center stage.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, however, many of these heirloom recipes are part of an oral tradition that is being lost. Younger generations are not as interested in these sweets or don&#x2019;t have the time to make them, and the heart of the older generation resists the uniformity of modernization.<br>&nbsp;<br>In my quest to save these recipes from extinction, I visited artisans in small family-run factories, homes, museums, libraries, bakeries, ice cream shops, and endless markets. I talked to everyone I knew, everyone who might know someone who may know someone who has heard of someone in a place where it is said they make the best ice cream, bread, or caramel. I spoke to everyone I could, even when I was asking for directions or buying a bus ticket. The people working in the different <i>casas de cultura populares</i>, taxi drivers, and market vendors seemed to be some of the best resources. I was not always welcomed, because people are very protective of their recipes and many told me they prefer to go to their grave with them rather than share, even if no one in their family is interested in them at all. <br>&nbsp;<br>On the other hand, many candy artisans welcomed me and showed me how their treats were made; some even gave me their recipes, for which I am extremely grateful. As a Mexican pastry chef, I then filled in the blanks, so to speak. Although I discovered many wonderful things along the way, my journey only reinforced the fact that there is still so much more to learn, to savor, and to document.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is not surprising that one of the hardest things for me was to let go and not include some recipes. With more than three hundred types of regional confections and two hundred varieties of sweet morning pastries, not to mention the countless fruits in Mexico and new recipes I found along the way, the task was not easy. Many of the original recipes are very lengthy, so I have made them more user-friendly while preserving the essence that captures much happiness from my childhood.<br>&nbsp;<br>I believe that documenting is continuity, and I have attempted to do just that. I hope to highlight some of the most important aspects of Mexican culture and the wonderful people who have helped keep the traditions alive. Welcome to the cultural and tasty journey of my sweet Mexico.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i><b>Jamoncillo de Leche | Milk Fudge</b></i><br>&nbsp;<br>2 (14-ounce) cans condensed milk<br>1 (12-ounce) can evaporated goat&#x2019;s or cow&#x2019;s milk<br>6 tablespoons unsalted butter <br>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>Pinch of salt<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Jamoncillos</i> come in different shapes and sizes, but they are always deliciously sweet (very sweet), fudgelike candies. Some of the best I&#x2019;ve had are prepared by the Hernandez family in Toluca. This three-generation family-run business is set up in their home. The copper pots are filled with raw cow&#x2019;s or goat&#x2019;s milk, and while some stir as it cooks down with sugar for many hours, other members of the family are busy pouring or cutting different candies out on the sunny patio. The flavors they have never cease to surprise me, including lime, pine nut, coffee, papaya, guava, and coconut, to name a few. <br>&nbsp;<br>I wanted to include at least one candy recipe in the book that wasn&#x2019;t as time-consuming as the others, so this is a modern adaptation of a classic. It will definitely not be as good as the ones the Hernandez family makes, but they did inspire me to play around with a few variations that will surely please anyone with a sweet tooth. <br>&nbsp;<br>Lightly grease a 9 by 9-inch square pan. Line the pan with a piece of parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving about a 1-inch overhang on all sides.<br>&nbsp;<br>Combine the condensed milk, evaporated milk, butter, vanilla, and salt in a saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring continuously with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula, until the mixture has thickened and starts pulling away from the sides of the pan, 20 to 30 minutes. When ready, it will slide easily out of the pan when tilted.<br>&nbsp;<br>Pour into the prepared pan and allow to set, about 2 hours. Cut into rectangles or desired shapes.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Makes about 2 dozen<br></i></p><h2>Jesus the King Study Guide: Exploring the Life and Death of the Son of God</h2><p><p>In this 9-session Bible study guide, <em>Jesus the King</em>, Timothy Keller will help you and your group discover the most influential man to ever walk the earth ...

Many of these formative strips have never been collected or reprinted anywhere else. Introduction by Garrison Keillor.</p><p>Good grief! <i>The Complete Peanuts 1950-1952</i> launches the most ambitious and most important project in the comics and cartooning genre: over a period of 12 years, Fantagraphics Books will release every daily and Sunday strip of Charles M. Schulz's "Peanuts," the best-known and best-loved series in the world. Most everyone with an interest in its history has seen the very first strip ("Good ol' Charlie Brown... How I hate him!"), but this first volume follows it up with 287 pages (three daily strips or one Sunday per page) of vintage material in chronological order. "Peanuts" was unique at the time for portraying kids who seemed like real kids, but they also had a wisdom beyond their years, embodied especially by the lovable loser, Charlie Brown, who even in these early years has lost 4000 checker games in a row. We see him don his familiar jagged-stripe shirt for the first time (December 1950) and, at the age of 4, at his peak as a babe magnet. Shermy is the other significant boy, and the girls in their lives are Patty (not to be confused with Peppermint Patty) and Violet. Schroeder is an infant who has learned to sit up in order to play Beethoven on his toy piano. Snoopy is an anthropomorphic dog who plays baseball (April 1952) and has his own thoughts (October 1952). In March 1952 we meet a bug-eyed Lucy, who by November has been designated "Miss Fuss-Budget of 1952" and is pulling the football away from Charlie Brown (Violet had done it a year earlier). Her baby brother Linus arrives in July 1952. The book itself is beautifully packaged, the strips printed large and clear on high-quality paper and accompanied by an in-depth essay by David Michaelis, a 1987 interview with Schulz, an introduction by Garrison Keillor, and even an index of characters and subjects. It's so well-done that any reader will be impatient for the rest of the series, but in the meantime this is a book to savor. <i>--David Horiuchi</i><p><strong>Charles M. Schulz</strong> was born November 25, 1922, in Minneapolis. His destiny was foreshadowed when an uncle gave him, at the age of two days, the nickname Sparky (after the racehorse Spark Plug in the newspaper strip <em>Barney Google</em>).<br><br> In his senior year in high school, his mother noticed an ad in a local newspaper for a correspondence school, Federal Schools (later called Art Instruction Schools). Schulz passed the talent test, completed the course, and began trying, unsuccessfully, to sell gag cartoons to magazines. (His first published drawing was of his dog, Spike, and appeared in a 1937 <em>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</em> installment.) Between 1948 and 1950, he succeeded in selling 17 cartoons to the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>&#x2015;as well as, to the local <em>St. Paul Pioneer Press</em>, a weekly comic feature called <em>Li'l Folks</em>. It was run in the women's section and paid $10 a week. After writing and drawing the feature for two years, Schulz asked for a better location in the paper or for daily exposure, as well as a raise. When he was turned down on all three counts, he quit.<br><br> He started submitting strips to the newspaper syndicates. In the spring of 1950, he received a letter from the United Feature Syndicate, announcing their interest in his submission, <em>Li'l Folks</em>. Schulz boarded a train in June for New York City; more interested in doing a strip than a panel, he also brought along the first installments of what would become <em>Peanuts</em>&#x2015;and that was what sold. (The title, which Schulz loathed to his dying day, was imposed by the syndicate.) The first <em>Peanuts</em> daily appeared October 2, 1950; the first Sunday, January 6, 1952.<br><br> Diagnosed with cancer, Schulz retired from <em>Peanuts</em> at the end of 1999. He died on February 13, 2000, the day before Valentine's Day&#x2015;and the day before his last strip was published&#x2015;having completed 17,897 daily and Sunday strips, each and every one fully written, drawn, and lettered entirely by his own hand&#x2015;an unmatched achievement in comics.</p><p><strong>Garrison Keillor</strong> has hosted the comedy/variety radio show <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em> since 1974. His many books include <em>Lake Wobegon Days, Leaving Home, Happy to Be Here, The Book of Guys, Homegrown Democrat, Lake Wobegon Summer 1956, Love Me, Wobegon Boy, Pontoon, Liberty</em>, and <em>Pilgrims</em>. Audio CDs and cassettes of compilations of <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em> and Keillor's readings of his books have sold in the millions. He wrote the script for and starred in the 2006 motion picture <em>A Prairie Home Companion</em>, the final film directed by Robert Altman.</p></p><h2>Mexican Ice Cream: Beloved Recipes and Stories [A Cookbook]</h2><p><b>A collection of 60+ flavor-packed recipes for ice creams and frozen treats rooted in Mexico's rich and revered ice cream traditions.</b><br><br>This new offering from the incredibly popular baker and sweets maker Fany Gerson, the powerhouse behind Brooklyn's La Newyorkina and Dough, showcases the incredibly diverse flavors of Mexican ice cream while exploring the cultural aspects of preparing and consuming ice cream in Mexico. Gerson uses unique ingredients to create exciting and fresh flavors like Red Prickly Pear Ice Cream,<br>Oaxacan-style Lime Sorbet, Avocado-Chocolate Ice Cream, and Rice-Almond Ice Cream with Cinnamon. All recipes are created with the home cook in mind, and written in Fany's knowledgeable but accessible voice. <i>Mexican Ice Cream </i>features vibrant location photography and captures the authentic Mexican heladerias that Gerson has been visiting for decades. For anyone looking to up their summer ice cream game, this is the book.</p><p>A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, FANY GERSON has&nbsp;worked in a range of fine-dining kitchens around the world. She is the founder of&nbsp;La Newyorkina, a catering company, roving food truck, and soon-to-be brick and&nbsp;mortar restaurant in Manhattan, and Dough bakery. Her work has been featured in&nbsp;the <i>New York Times, <i>Gourmet, Fine Cooking, <i>Daily Candy,</i></i></i> and more. Her previous&nbsp;titles include <i><i><i><i>Paletas </i></i></i></i>and <i><i><i><i><i>My Sweet Mexico.<br></i></i></i></i></i><b>Smooth Sorbet&nbsp;</b><br><br> A well-made sorbet is creamy and smooth (not taking into consideration fruit chunks or bits added for texture). Achieving the perfect consistency is all about getting the right balance of ingredients.&nbsp;<br><br>Sugar adds sweetness, of course, but because it doesn&#x2019;t freeze, it also affects a sorbet&#x2019;s consistency. Granulated sugar requires liquid of some sort to dissolve the crystals, but if too much liquid is added, the sorbet will be icy and hard when frozen, and the flavor may be compromised. In this case, using some sugar in liquid rather than granulated form, such as honey or light corn syrup, can help keep the sorbet smooth. Just a tablespoon or two inhibits the formation of ice crystals during freezing, and the thickness of honey or corn syrup gives the sorbet base a little more body, which means a creamier consistency.&nbsp;<br><br>It&#x2019;s well-known that alcohol doesn&#x2019;t freeze. Adding just 2 to 3 tablespoons of alcohol per quart (of frozen sorbet) can have a big impact on the sorbet&#x2019;s consistency.&nbsp;<br><br> In Mexico, to ensure a good consistency, some sorbet makers add <i>cremola</i>, or guar gum, to their bases. This widely used emulsifier is a natural powder, and just a little bit does the trick. In the United States, guar gum can be found at many natural food stores and online.&nbsp;<br><br> Fruits that contain high amounts of pectin, a natural thickener, yield creamy sorbets without the help of corn syrup, alcohol, or guar gum. Peaches, raspberries, and mangoes are examples of pectin-rich fruits.&nbsp;<br><b> OAXACAN LIME SORBET&nbsp;</b><br> Nieve de Lim�n Oaxaque�o&nbsp;<br> <b>MAKES ABOUT &nbsp;</b>� <b>1 </b>�&nbsp;<b>QUART&nbsp;</b><br> This lime sorbet is popular all over Oaxaca. Unlike Nieve de Lim�n (page 29), this one is made with only lime zest and no juice, so the flavor is very intense but without any tartness. The bright green color may appear artificial but is the result of using so much grated lime zest.&nbsp;<br><br> In Oaxaca, sorbet makers often use <i>tiernos </i>limes, which are immature limes that have a very strong flavor but do not yield much juice. I find that Key limes are similar in taste to <i>tiernos</i>, but you can use any kind, really. Try to find small, dark-colored limes for the best flavor, and be sure to wash and dry them carefully before zesting.&nbsp;<br> <b>12 Key limes, washed and dried <br>1 cup sugar <br>3� cups water <br>1 tablespoon light corn syrup <br>Pinch of kosher salt&nbsp;</b><br> Grate the zest from the limes, removing as much of the green skin as possible and avoiding the white pith. In a blender or food processor, combine the zest and sugar and pulse 4 or 5 times to extract the natural oils. Transfer the sugar mixture to a bowl, add the water, corn syrup, and salt, and whisk until the sugar dissolves. Cover and refrigerate until cold, at least 2 hours but no more than 4 hours.&nbsp;<br> Freeze and churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions. For a soft consistency, serve the sorbet right away; for a firmer consistency, transfer it to a container, cover, and allow to harden in the freezer for 2 to 3 hours.</p><h2>86--EIGHTY-SIX, Vol. 3 (light novel): Run Through the Battlefront (Finish) (86--EIGHTY-SIX (light novel), 3)</h2><p>Pride is all we have<br>The attack Shin foresaw has finally come to pass.

Guards and henchmen, dancers and bounty hunters, humans and Jawas and Weequays and Arcona lay where they&#x2019;d toppled, crumpled under arches or piled in semiprivate cubicles or sprawled in the open. The inner portcullis yawned open.<br> &nbsp;<br> Just another all-nighter at Jabba&#x2019;s palace.<br> &nbsp;<br> That portcullis bothers me&#x2014;what if we want to leave in a hurry?&#x2014;but it keeps out the worst of the riffraff.<br> &nbsp;<br> Let me rephrase that. The worst of the riffraff, Jabba himself, paid us well. Crime lord, connoisseur, critic; his hairless, blotchy tail twitched in rhythm when we played. Not our rhythm. His.<br> &nbsp;<br> We are Figrin D&#x2019;an and the Modal Nodes, members in good standing of the Intergalactic Federation of Musicians, and we are&#x2014;or were&#x2014;Jabba&#x2019;s full-time resident entertainers. I&#x2019;ve never spotted his ears, but Jabba appreciates a good swing band. He also likes controlling credit and inflicting pain, and he finds either more therapeutic than our music.<br> &nbsp;<br> Huddled on the back of the stage, we put away our horns while Jabba&#x2019;s guests snored. My Fizzz&#x2014;you symphonic ridgebrows would call it a Dorenian Beshniquel, but this is jizz&#x2014;slips into a thin case in less time than it takes to roll an Imperial inspector and check his pockets for credit vouchers.<br> &nbsp;<br> We are Bith. Our high hairless craniums manifest a superior evolutionary level, and our mouth folds pucker into a splendid embouchure for wind instruments. We perceive sounds as precisely as other species perceive color.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our band leader, Figrin Da&#x2019;n, was wearily swabbing his Kloo Horn (there&#x2019;s a joke there, but you&#x2019;d have to speak Bithian to get it). It&#x2019;s a longer double-reed than my Fizzz, richer in pastel harmonics but not so sweet. Tedn and Ickabel were arguing over their Fanfar cases. Nalan had started disconnecting the horn bells from his Bandfill, and Tech&#x2014;we look alike to non-Bith, but you might&#x2019;ve picked out Tech by the glazed gleam in his eyes&#x2014;sat slumped over his Ommni Box. Plaster chips from a midnight blaster skirmish littered the Ommni&#x2019;s reception dish. (The Ommni clips our peaks, attenuates the lows, reverbs and amps the total sound. Playing it takes even a Bith&#x2019;s full genius. Tech hates Figrin. Figrin won the Ommni last season in a sabacc game.)<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey, Doikk.&#x201d; Figrin&#x2019;s head glistened. It was going to be a typical Tatooine scorcher, and Jabba&#x2019;s temp exchanger needed repair.<br> &nbsp;<br> I cinched down my Fizzz. My Fizzz. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; I had a shot &#x201c;lip,&#x201d; as humans call it. I was in no mood for foolishness.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Time for a friendly hand of sabacc?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t gamble, Figrin.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Figrin brushed the sheen off his head with one knobby hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thermal, Doikk.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And you&#x2019;re compulsive. &#x201c;All musicians are thermal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re thermal for a musician. Who ever heard of a bander that didn&#x2019;t gamble?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m the band&#x2019;s inside outsider, the straight man. I&#x2019;ve carried that sweet little Fizzz through six systems. I peg it when it cracks and lube it when the keys click. I carve my own reeds. I wasn&#x2019;t betting it on any sabacc match. Not even to placate Fiery Figrin Da&#x2019;n, a bandleader who criticizes every missed note, owns everybody (else)&#x2019;s instruments, and isn&#x2019;t shy about giving orders.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t gamble, Figrin. You know th&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> A smoky silhouette rolled in through the main arch. &#x201c;Figrin,&#x201d; I mouthed, &#x201c;turn around. Slowly.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The droid&#x2019;s wasp waist, huge shoulders, and squared-off head had scalded my memory shortly after Jabba gave us our exclusive contract: his vintage E522 Assassin. Eefive-tootoo had saved my neck when one of Jabba&#x2019;s human sail- barge tenders accused me of munching out of Jabba&#x2019;s private snack tank of live freckled toads. Luckily for me, Eefive-tootoo gave me an alibi. I&#x2019;d vowed never again to have more to do with humans than necessary.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Jabba&#x2019;d been hot to feed someone to the rancor. Justice would&#x2019;ve suggested throwing in my human accuser, but Jabba and Justice are not on speaking terms. They dropped Eefive, liberally smeared with meat juice, through the rancor&#x2019;s trapdoor in front of Jabba&#x2019;s throne. By the time Jabba&#x2019;s huge, slavering mutant spat him out, he was beyond repair.<br> &nbsp;<br> Or so I&#x2019;d thought. Was he back for revenge?<br> &nbsp;<br> He wore no restraining bolt. Rolling around a blaster-scarred column, he headed toward us. Frantically I looked around. Nobody showed signs of waking up to rescue us.<br> &nbsp;<br> The droid raised his upper limbs. Both ended at elbow joints. Somebody&#x2019;d disengaged his business parts&#x2014;but that didn&#x2019;t leave him helpless. Assassin droids carry backup.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Figrin Da&#x2019;n?&#x201d; he asked in a brassy green treble.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What would you do&nbsp;...&nbsp;if you found him?&#x201d; Figrin sidled closer to me, trying to sound colorless. I&#x2019;ve never carried a blaster. I wished I had one then, for all the good it would&#x2019;ve done.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Message delivery,&#x201d; honked the droid. &#x201c;Do not fear. My assassination programming has been erased, and as you can see, my weapons are gone. My new employer saved me from deconstruction by using me this way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t remember us,&#x201d; Figrin whispered in Bithian. &#x201c;His memory&#x2019;s been erased, too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As I slowed my breathing, my longstanding attitude about assassin droids resurfaced: Never worry about one you can see. He hadn&#x2019;t fired before we spotted him, so we were safe. And I&#x2019;ve always gotten along better with droids than with most sentients. Particularly humans.<br> &nbsp;<br> But as for stripping Eefive of his weapons, that would be like&nbsp;...&nbsp;like saving my life by cutting off all my fingers.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s your new owner?&#x201d; I asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> The droid hissed, shushing me with white noise.<br> &nbsp;<br> I dropped my voice. &#x201c;Who?&#x201d; I repeated sotto voce.<br> &nbsp;<br> The answer came softly. &#x201c;Mistress Valarian.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh, ho. Val to her friends, Jabba&#x2019;s chief rival in the spaceport town of Mos Eisley, a tusk-mouthed Whiphid recently arrived on Tatooine. Gambling, weapons running, information for sale, the usual&nbsp;...&nbsp;but she&#x2019;d thrived. No wonder she sent a recycled envoy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now that I&#x2019;d processed the lack of immediate risk, I leaned back against the stage. &#x201c;What does she want?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She wishes to hire your services for a wedding, to be held in Mos Eisley at her Lucky Despot Hotel.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;d heard of the Lucky Despot. Figrin puckered his lip folds. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t do weddings,&#x201d; we answered in unison.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Please understand. A wedding gig wastes two days (three days, with some species, plus the time it takes to learn new music). You&#x2019;re treated like a recording, told to repeat impossible phrases and lengthen the usual processional, and ordered to play a final chord as the nerve-wracked principals arrive center stage&nbsp;...&nbsp;if they arrive. Someone always brings a screaming neonate. Then the reception, where they inebriate themselves until no one hears a note. All this for half pay and full satisfaction: You&#x2019;ve helped perpetuate a species.<br> Eefive swiveled his flat head toward Figrin. Obviously his recognition circuits still functioned. &#x201c;Mistress Valarian procured a mate from her home world,&#x201d; he declared.<br> &nbsp;<br> Good thing I wasn&#x2019;t drinking. I&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve choked. The only thing uglier than a Hutt is a Whiphid. I tried to imagine another gargantuan, rank-furred, yellow-tusked Whiphid arriving on Tatooine. Valarian had probably promised luxury accommodations and good hunting. Wait&#x2019;ll he saw Mos Eisley.<br> &nbsp;<br> The droid continued. &#x201c;This job is for their reception only. Mistress Valarian offers your band three thousand credits. Transport and lodging provided, and unlimited meals and drinks during your stay. Also five breaks during the reception.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Three thousand credits? With my share, I could start my own band&#x2014;live in the finest habitats&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;<br> Figrin hunched forward. &#x201c;Sabacc tables?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> Too late, I recovered from my greed attack. Jabba had given us an exclusive contract. He wouldn&#x2019;t like our performing for Valarian, and when Jabba frowns, somebody dies. No, Figrin! I thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Except while performing, certainly,&#x201d; the droid answered.<br> &nbsp;<br> I buzzed my mouth folds for Figrin&#x2019;s attention, but his sublime vision didn&#x2019;t deal me in. Figrin set down his deck and commenced negotiating.<br> &nbsp;<br> We flew into Mos Eisley during first twilight, with one of the suns dipping behind a dull, murky horizon. Our cramped little transport skimmed through the decaying southern sector, chauffeured by an orange service droid. He, like the former assassin, wore no restraining bolt, which predisposed me to like their owner. Sentient shadows slipped into darkening corners as we drove past. The byword in Mos Eisley, which looks like a cluster of populated sand dunes, is camouflage. If nobody sees you, nobody shoots you. Or testifies against you in what passes for local courts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three stories above one of Mos Eisley&#x2019;s nameless streets, twin beacons blinked like ship lamps, and brilliant yellow beams glowed out of a wide-open entry hatch. The droid maneuvered us closer. A long curving ramp and straight stairs swooped up from street level to the elevated main entry. Beneath the stairway, I spotted the hotel&#x2019;s most notable feature: three large portholes.<br> &nbsp;<br> A group of investors crazy enough to sink their credits on Tatooine had towed a beat-up cargo hauler here and sunk a quarter of it under the sand. Debris blown in by a recent dust storm lay clumped along its near side, which had been starboard. Antenna-cluster wreckage drooped over what must&#x2019;ve been the cockpit. I mentally saluted the Lucky Despot with the spacer&#x2019;s traditional appraisal of somebody else&#x2019;s ship: What a piece of junk.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our speeder settled at the foot of the long ramp. &#x201c;Disembark here, gentles,&#x201d; droned the droid.<br> &nbsp;<br> We unloaded our gear from the airbus&#x2019;s cargo compartment onto a repulsor cart. We&#x2019;d only brought one change of clothes and our performing outfits, and left the rest of our belongings at Jabba&#x2019;s palace. Mos Eisley&#x2019;s odors&#x2014;ship fuels, rancid food, low-tech industrial haze, and the sheer desensitizing smell of hot sand&#x2014;hung in sullen air.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Searching for Sylvie Lee: A Read with Jenna Pick</h2><p><p><strong>INSTANT&nbsp;<em>NEW YORK TIMES</em>&nbsp;BESTSELLER</strong></p><p><strong>A READ WITH&nbsp;JENNA&nbsp;</strong>�&nbsp;<strong><em>TODAY</em>&nbsp;SHOW BOOK CLUB PICK&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>NAMED A MOST ANTICIPATED BOOK&nbsp;BY&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;<em>�&nbsp;Time&nbsp;� Marie Claire</em>&nbsp;<em>� Elle</em>&nbsp;<em>� Buzzfeed</em>&nbsp;<em>� Huffington Post</em>&nbsp;<em>� Good Housekeeping&nbsp;� The Week</em>&nbsp;<em>� Goodreads</em>&nbsp;<em>� New York Post&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>� Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</em>and many more</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;This is a true beach read!
